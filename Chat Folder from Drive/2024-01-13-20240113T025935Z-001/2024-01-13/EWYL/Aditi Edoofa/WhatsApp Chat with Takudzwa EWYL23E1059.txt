29/12/23, 8:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be Takudzwa's mentor. Before connecting today, I was given the responsibility for his application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback from his counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of his application, particularly his desire to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of collective growth has always been my interest.
29/12/23, 9:03 AM - +263 78 749 5077: It's my pleasure to meet you
29/12/23, 9:05 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Same here!
29/12/23, 9:06 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are? <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 9:08 AM - +263 78 749 5077: No
29/12/23, 9:09 AM - +263 78 749 5077: May you please let me know
29/12/23, 9:13 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Takudzwa* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals. <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 9:15 AM - +263 78 749 5077: Thank you
29/12/23, 9:15 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
29/12/23, 9:41 AM - +263 78 749 5077: That's great and wonderful.
29/12/23, 9:41 AM - +263 78 749 5077: I am facing some network challenges
29/12/23, 9:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
29/12/23, 9:42 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now we are concluding our session!
As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes your way. May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness. 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊
29/12/23, 9:47 AM - +263 78 749 5077: I wish you a happy and prosperous new year as well

6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs,* showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - +263 78 721 7836: Ok thanks
6/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 78 749 5077: Thank you
11/1/24, 9:29 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Takudzwa, good morning!
I hope all is okay with you.

I'm happy to let you know that I've returned from the industrial visit, and I really missed our sessions. I apologize for missing our 8:30 AM session; rest assured, though, as I promised to share the pictures with you as soon as possible. Our session has been rescheduled from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM, so please confirm your availability.
11/1/24, 9:42 AM - +263 78 721 7836: Ok I am available
11/1/24, 9:45 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
11/1/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So are you ready for today's session?🚀
11/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 721 7836: Yes
11/1/24, 1:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 78 721 7836: Ok that is great!
11/1/24, 1:44 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Takudzwa to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
11/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 78 721 7836: Ok I got it
11/1/24, 1:50 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once Takudzwa forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️
