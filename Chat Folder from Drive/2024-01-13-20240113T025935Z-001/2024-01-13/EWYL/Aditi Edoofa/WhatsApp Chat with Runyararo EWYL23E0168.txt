As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (2-Jan-2024) to commence the procedures.

5/1/24, 8:33 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!✨
How are you?

Hope you are ready to begin with today's session.🚀
5/1/24, 1:24 PM - Aditi Edoofa: @263779525708 May I know why didn't you show up at your session's time?
5/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Good afternoon
Sorry about that we did not have electricity here and my phone had died
5/1/24, 5:35 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Tomorrow l will make sure that l am  available
6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs,* showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
11/1/24, 9:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Runyararo, good morning!
I hope all is okay with you.

I'm happy to let you know that I've returned from the industrial visit, and I really missed our sessions. I apologize for missing our 8:30 AM session; rest assured, though, as I promised to share the pictures with you as soon as possible. Our session has been rescheduled from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM, so please confirm your availability.
11/1/24, 9:48 AM - +263 77 952 5708: Good morning
Yes l will be available
11/1/24, 10:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
11/1/24, 1:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So are you ready for today's session?🚀

11/1/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Okay
11/1/24, 1:43 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
11/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 952 5708: My long term goal is achieving my degree with flying colors and from there l want to pursue my dream.l think the EWYL program will help me because they are teaching how l can earn at a young age whilst going to school at the same time and l think that's going to be advantage for me because it's teaching me skills
11/1/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's great to hear about your long-term goals and aspirations. Achieving your degree with flying colors is a fantastic objective, and pursuing your dream afterward is an exciting journey. The Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program is indeed a valuable opportunity for you. Learning how to earn at a young age while simultaneously attending school is indeed advantageous. Acquiring practical skills through this program can set you on a path to success and independence.
11/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes
11/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 952 5708: No l don't
11/1/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/1/24, 2:01 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Okay.i understand
11/1/24, 2:11 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Okay.
Thank you
11/1/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
11/1/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

11/1/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
11/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 77 952 5708: Yes it is a great deal indeed
11/1/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: As our session comes to a close, It was amazing talking to you.
Have a wonderful day, and take care!

Same to you
11/1/24, 4:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️
