Yes
2/1/24, 9:00 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
2/1/24, 9:01 AM - +263 71 418 5330: The other participant is my Father 
Mr Chitungo
2/1/24, 9:04 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I am pleased to meet him and I extend a warm welcome to him for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey✨
2/1/24, 9:09 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
2/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 71 418 5330: My long term terms goals include obtaining a degree and futher pursue for a masters in my line of study and I think EWYL program will help me by being able to contribute greatly to my university fees and being able to pursue my education without financial burden
2/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: That's an impressive set of goals!  Obtaining a degree and pursuing a master's in your field is a fantastic aspiration.  The EWYL program is indeed an excellent opportunity to alleviate financial concerns and empower you to focus on your education.
2/1/24, 9:19 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
2/1/24, 9:20 AM - +263 71 418 5330: No
2/1/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
2/1/24, 9:21 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

2/1/24, 9:34 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*

2/1/24, 9:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

5/1/24, 1:22 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Sorry there is power shortage

6/1/24, 1:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of *our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs,* showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:20 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Thank you
11/1/24, 9:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Tinashe, good morning!
I hope all is okay with you.

I'm happy to let you know that I've returned from the industrial visit, and I really missed our sessions. I apologize for missing our 8:30 AM session; rest assured, though, as I promised to share the pictures with you as soon as possible. Our session has been rescheduled from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM, so please confirm your availability.

11/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
11/1/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
11/1/24, 1:53 PM - +263 71 418 5330: My task is to identify companies in my country or region and share my objectives on how Edoofa is giving me necessary skills for employment after future graduation and I have to create a professional networking platform which allows me to connect with companies and communicate with employees and I can download the app on play store.I will be able to reach out to managers and Human Resources managers initiating conversations and gatherings and to set up meetings with Edoofa .

You will provide me with documents which will help me to search for companies to target and how to initiate conversation… 

Creating an account will increase my chances for securing internship and finding job opportunities within my country..
11/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
11/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
11/1/24, 1:55 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 418 5330: I understood that when searching for companies we should consider the following 

1.Nature of company 
2.Scale of company 
3.Financial stability 
4.Background of founder 

The above points should be adhered to when looking for a company so that I can get the right one 

And I can use the following platforms to look for the right company : Google, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Inc4media, Internshala(or
  any other internship providing sources), Social media pages( Facebook, Instagram.
11/1/24, 2:40 PM - Aditi Edoofa: As our session comes to a close, It was amazing talking to you.

I quickly just wanted to share the scoop on *Slice Con'24—it was seriously awesome!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The *AI sessions* were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️
