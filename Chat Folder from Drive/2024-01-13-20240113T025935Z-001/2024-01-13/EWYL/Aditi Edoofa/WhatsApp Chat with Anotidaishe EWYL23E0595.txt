11/1/24, 5:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Please excuse me for not being able to begin your sessions on 8 January 24 as I was caught up in our annual event for our India Edoofians which is *Slice Con'24!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The AI sessions were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️

12/1/24, 1:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So Anotidaishe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 357 6468: Thank you
12/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Ever since I started learning, I always wanted to be like my mom's brother . He's a business man and he's excelling in all the things he's doing and it got to wonder that I have to be better and be like him or even better than. I want to be able to provide for my family and also be able to be a someone who contributes something useful to the community . I cannot say I'm that bright but I always try to reach my full potential and I think you teaching me the methods and being able to know more through the EWYL program will help me reach the goals of being a successful business owner and to be able to make sure that my family is okay and to be a useful citizen to the country
12/1/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your aspirations with such clarity and determination. Your commitment to not only achieve personal success but also contribute positively to your family and community is truly admirable. The drive to surpass the achievements of your uncle showcases a strong work ethic and ambition. I'm here to offer support and guidance as you embark on your journey, and I believe the EWYL program can provide valuable insights and methods to help you reach your goals. Remember, your dedication and willingness to learn are powerful assets on your path to success.
12/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 799 9362: I can't wait to be mind blown by insights you are going to give  , nothing makes me happy more than this. 
Thank you 🙏
12/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Woww! Thank you for your kind words!❤️
12/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 71 799 9362: No I'm hoping you would make me understand and help me to know  the two objectives.
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 71 799 9362: You are welcome 🤗
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 1:59 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Thank you for showing me the two goals , I think of I I work I will be able to reach and surpass those goals. I would love to help my parents to pay my tuition fees
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 799 9362: It's really nice to meet you , I can't really express how happy I am to he working with you all and seeking your guidance and advice through the way 
My name is Anotidaishe Victor Mukanga
12/1/24, 2:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: This is awesome, they are also honored to have you.
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Thank you 🙏
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/1/24, 2:10 PM - +263 71 799 9362: It sounds very interesting and I'm glad I will be doing something fun , it's been long since I've done that.
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Yeah ten minutes is enough.
12/1/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
12/1/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
12/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Yes I would really enjoy to be in that section because I got to know how they learn to adjust to problems and I got on now that there some things we have in common with these students in the hall of fame
12/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 799 9362: Thank you for wonderful session and have a wonderful weekend 🙏
12/1/24, 2:37 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you!
12/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 799 9362: You are welcome 🙏
