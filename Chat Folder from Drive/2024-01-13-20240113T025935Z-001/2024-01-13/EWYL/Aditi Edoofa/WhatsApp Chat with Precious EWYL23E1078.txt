12/1/24, 1:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 724 4398: That was my mother , she is a sells lady and a mother of three including I and two other siblings after me
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: It's great to connect with her! I extend a warm welcome to her for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey.
12/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Thank you
12/1/24, 1:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 78 724 4398: My long term goals are to graduate from university and get a professional paying job ....the EWYL program will help me in Aiding my tuition fees hence making my education cost bearable
12/1/24, 1:42 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term goals. Graduating from university and securing a professional paying job are excellent aspirations. It's great to hear that you see the EWYL program as a valuable support in achieving these goals by aiding with tuition fees. Education is a powerful tool, and your commitment to making it more accessible is commendable.🚀❤️
12/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes ....thank you
12/1/24, 1:52 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Affordable but quality education
12/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I am not sure of the second
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 1:58 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Understood
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I am pleased to meet them
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome, I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Yes it does
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

12/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 724 4398: I have gone through them
12/1/24, 2:26 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
12/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 724 4398: Indeed it is ....I would love for that to be me some day
12/1/24, 2:28 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
12/1/24, 2:29 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
12/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 724 4398: That sounds incredible
12/1/24, 2:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
12/1/24, 2:32 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube
