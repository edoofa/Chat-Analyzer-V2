11/1/24, 4:49 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hellooooo!!!!

Please excuse me for not being able to begin your sessions on 8 January 24 as I was caught up in our annual event for our India Edoofians which is *Slice Con'24!* The event was nothing short of extraordinary, providing students with a wealth of exposure and valuable insights. 🚀
Throughout the event, students actively engaged with CEOs, asking insightful questions and gaining a deeper understanding of various industries. The AI sessions were particularly enlightening, offering a glimpse into the cutting-edge advancements in technology and some amazing AI Tools🤖

But wait, there's more! They also played games and made some great memories. It was a total win-win—fun and educational at the same time. Here is a glimpse of how it went, looking forward to when you will also get this chance to be here and experience these amazing things🤩❤️
