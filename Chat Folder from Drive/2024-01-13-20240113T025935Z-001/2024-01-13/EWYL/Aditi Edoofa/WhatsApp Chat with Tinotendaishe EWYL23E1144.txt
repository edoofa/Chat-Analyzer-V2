12/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Yes
12/1/24, 1:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.

12/1/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Same to you!
12/1/24, 1:39 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Tinotendaishe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 71 486 3780: My long-term goals include opening up later on my own Law firm. That will reflect my greatest  passion for family Law.Whilst including as well other  areas of law.  I as well want to advance in my studies as well. I believe the EWYL Program will be of great assistance as it will help with affordability of the particular course l want to achieve. Which makes it easier for my parents and it will be a great experience for myself as an individual. <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 1:54 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term goals. The vision of opening your own Law firm with a focus on family law, while also expanding into other areas of law, is both ambitious and inspiring. Pursuing further studies to advance in your field showcases a commitment to continuous learning and professional growth. I'm delighted to hear that you believe the EWYL Program will play a significant role in supporting your aspirations, making the course more affordable for you and easing the financial burden on your parents.
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Thank you
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 486 3780: No
12/1/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Noted
12/1/24, 2:04 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Noted
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - +263 71 288 0016: Thank you for the very clear articulation of the objectives
12/1/24, 2:05 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
12/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Noted
12/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Yes
12/1/24, 2:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
12/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 71 486 3780: I did notice it and it is a great deal
12/1/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
12/1/24, 2:17 PM - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
12/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 71 486 3780: It sounds great
12/1/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
12/1/24, 2:19 PM - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is
12/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 71 486 3780: 1. On my EWYL team l have my parents. My mentor  Ms. Aditi and Mr Angad Singh and Ms. Davi my coach.
2. To make sure l have a great academic journey.
To enable me to have  an opportunity to be financially  independent for my higher education in india.
And to work hard in attaning the objectives.
3.A newsletter
4. To me the hall of inspiration is a space used for the recognition of exceptional students who have gone beyond their abilities to give back to their community. <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
12/1/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
12/1/24, 2:33 PM - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Yes
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.

12/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Done
12/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 71 486 3780: Thank you have a great weekend
12/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 71 486 3780: These are the aspects l understood from the documents there are 3 different projects the corporate alliance , the community building and african schools of education reform mission. With the african reform mission l understood that my school as well has to be included as l will be basically  tasked  to inform on the Edoofa program and its benefits. With the help of Edoofa itself. Then with the community building. I have to reach out to other students and inform them about Edoofa
 There are  steps to be taken . Which are application form, sharing about edoofa and incentive. Whilst with the corporate alliance it is mostly interaction and a research based project from my understanding.
12/1/24, 3:46 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
