12/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 506 8620: My long term vision and goal is getting the best of tertiary education and become a successful lawyer and l'm hoping that the EWYL program will be very advantageous to me as it will help me sponsor my education through earning scholarship credits and l will also gain employability skills
12/1/24, 1:53 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term vision and goals. Striving for the best in tertiary education and aspiring to become a successful lawyer is a commendable pursuit. I'm glad to hear that you see the EWYL program as a valuable resource on your journey. Earning scholarship credits to support your education and gaining employability skills are crucial steps toward achieving your aspirations.
12/1/24, 1:55 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Yes sure
12/1/24, 1:57 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 506 8620: No
12/1/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/1/24, 2:02 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Okay l'm clear with that
12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/1/24, 2:35 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Okay thank you for the introduction it's my pleasure to be connecting with them
12/1/24, 2:36 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
