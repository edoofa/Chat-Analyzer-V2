As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.

*🌌 "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning." - Albert Einstein 🌟*

As we delve into Einstein's insightful words, we're reminded of the dynamic journey of learning and growth. "Learn from yesterday" encourages reflection on past experiences, "live for today" emphasizes the present moment, and "hope for tomorrow" instills a forward-looking mindset.

In the context of your academic pursuit, this quote beckons you to embrace the continuous cycle of learning, applying knowledge in the present, and fostering hope for the future. Each question you pose becomes a stepping stone to new discoveries and personal development.

So, how are you doing today? 🌈 I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session.

28/12/23, 9:25 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-*

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Is that clear, Tinayeishe?
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma'am thank you so in nk longer going to do what you have tasked me to do about the project 1

28/12/23, 9:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *PROJECT 2: COMMUNITY BUILDING*
Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Tinayeishe!
28/12/23, 9:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
28/12/23, 9:44 AM - +263 78 790 1774: I have understood that the community building helps students to collaborate with communities and the goal is to  forster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction. The primary idea is to make students develop in network working, communication skills etc. And help other African to joic Edoofa systems.

28/12/23, 11:01 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Tinayeishe, I am impressed with your understanding.
28/12/23, 11:01 AM - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
28/12/23, 11:01 AM - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
28/12/23, 11:01 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

29/12/23, 8:48 AM - Sharda Edoofa: It is completely alright, it was for fun.

29/12/23, 8:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: The answer to the riddle is "a cloud." Clouds appear to fly without wings, they can release rain, which may be considered a form of crying without eyes, and they block the sun, creating darkness.
29/12/23, 8:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Learning: Clouds play a crucial role in the Earth's atmosphere, affecting weather patterns and reflecting, absorbing, and transmitting solar radiation. Understanding these natural phenomena enhances our knowledge of meteorology and climate science. 🌦️📚
29/12/23, 8:55 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Oooo kkk amazing thank you ma’am.Im looking forward to learn more from your riddles

29/12/23, 9:04 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
29/12/23, 9:15 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Q1.Regina Coeli High School ,it is not connected to Edoofa
Q2.you said you are going to send me the way l am going to talk to them but didn’t see it
Q3.Manicaland
29/12/23, 9:19 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great, yes I will help you out.
29/12/23, 9:21 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Thank you ma’am
29/12/23, 9:22 AM - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please.
29/12/23, 9:22 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
29/12/23, 9:23 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes ma’am
29/12/23, 9:27 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
29/12/23, 9:41 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following the discussion?
29/12/23, 9:43 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma’am
29/12/23, 9:43 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes ma’am sorry for late responses
29/12/23, 9:45 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
29/12/23, 9:46 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Yes ma’am let me search for the number
29/12/23, 9:47 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay that you can do after we finish our this discussion.
29/12/23, 9:48 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma’am
29/12/23, 9:52 AM - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

29/12/23, 9:53 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Tinayeishe, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.**
29/12/23, 9:55 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Understood
29/12/23, 9:57 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma’am

29/12/23, 11:26 AM - +263 78 790 1774: I haven’t discussed this with the school yet??
29/12/23, 11:32 AM - Sharda Edoofa: It is alright, we can carry forward our discussion later on.
29/12/23, 11:32 AM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma’am thank you

29/12/23, 1:42 PM - Sharda Edoofa: It was okay Tinayeishe.
29/12/23, 1:43 PM - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
29/12/23, 1:43 PM - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or

29/12/23, 1:51 PM - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Hello ma'am how are you
6/1/24, 1:52 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 790 1774: Okay ma'am thank you
11/1/24, 4:14 PM - Sharda Edoofa: _Greetings of the day, Tinayeishe_!
