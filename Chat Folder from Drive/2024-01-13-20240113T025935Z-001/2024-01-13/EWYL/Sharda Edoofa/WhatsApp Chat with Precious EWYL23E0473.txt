I hope you are doing well

As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.
26/12/23, 2:01 PM - +263 71 589 5789: There's nothing much....just family time ....how was yours??
26/12/23, 2:18 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Great. I too had a memorable family time.
26/12/23, 2:39 PM - +263 71 589 5789: That is great
26/12/23, 2:40 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Let us now continue our discussion exactly from where we left off.
26/12/23, 2:40 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Sharda Edoofa: or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Sharda Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.
Moreover, it is important that you make steady progress every day.
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Precious, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success.* Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
26/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 71 589 5789: Okay
26/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 71 589 5789: Okay
26/12/23, 2:59 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *So now we are ready to begin our new journey. You are  supposed to note a few things*
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *FIRST* - Please know that the  batch for your sessions will be : 
*Tuesday and Friday*






*SECOND* - The timing for the session will be : *9:30 AM - 11:00 AM*
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *THIRD*- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
Edoofa EWYL (contact):  +91 98107 89170




*FOURTH*- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say '*Greetings, Ms. Sharda, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'*
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *FIFTH* - Every day you  have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
26/12/23, 3:00 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly drop a message on the EWYL Line right now and let me know once done.
26/12/23, 3:14 PM - +263 71 589 5789: I'm done ma'am
26/12/23, 3:29 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update, Precious.
26/12/23, 9:07 PM - +263 71 589 5789: You're welcome ma'am
27/12/23, 1:34 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Good afternoon Precious*
As we gear up for our session, let's kick things off with a dose of motivation from Sundar Pichai:

"You might fail a few times, but that's Ok. You end up doing something worthwhile which you learn a great deal from." 🚀

In these powerful words, Pichai unveils the magic of embracing challenges. Failures aren't roadblocks but rather detours leading to invaluable lessons and remarkable achievements. 🌟

So, how are you doing today? 🌈 I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session. Let's turn challenges into opportunities and make this session truly worthwhile!
27/12/23, 2:05 PM - +263 71 589 5789: That's great.....am doing just fine...and you

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 589 5789: Oh okay... that's quite interesting...I was starting to get worried why you have been so quiet
6/1/24, 1:51 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 71 589 5789: Oh ok
11/1/24, 4:10 PM - Sharda Edoofa: _Greetings of the day, Precious_!

Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you few glimpses of this event.
