3/1/24, 4:31 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now that the time is over, we are wrapping up our scheduled session. Your absense did not go unnoticed and I would also like to understand the reason behind your absense. 

On a brighter note, I'm excited to share that we'll soon have the opportunity to meet in person at our annual conclave during the upcoming Industrial Visit. It promises to be an enriching experience where we can connect face-to-face, network, and delve deeper into our shared interests.

In the meantime, please look out for this week's Wednesday Lesson, which I'll be sharing shortly. It's another opportunity for us to continue our learning journey together.

The visit is one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists, engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*
