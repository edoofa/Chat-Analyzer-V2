I hope you are doing well.

I would like to tell you that our admissions team have been reaching out to you since last months. You are not in their group. Also, when you have been contacted by them personally, you have been unresponsive to them. 

May I know the challenge exactly?
6/1/24, 11:46 AM - +263 71 940 1175: Oh ma'am I've been also contacting them personally because I was given their number by my mentor Mr Shubham . They were not really responding  and ma'am I lost my phone so I'm not in the group now
6/1/24, 1:35 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Mitchell
I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:40 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 6:07 PM - +263 71 940 1175: Oh great , please do send the photos
6/1/24, 6:09 PM - +263 71 940 1175: Ma'am how will I connect with Admissions team
11/1/24, 4:44 PM - Sharda Edoofa: _Greetings of the day, Mitchell_!
Yes, sure.

Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you few glimpses of this event.
