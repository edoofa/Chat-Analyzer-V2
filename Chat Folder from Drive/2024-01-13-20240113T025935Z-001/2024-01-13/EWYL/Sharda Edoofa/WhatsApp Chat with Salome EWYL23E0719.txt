I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
