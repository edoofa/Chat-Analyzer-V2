I am writing to request an exception to the school's policy on phone usage. I have recently been awarded with this scholarship, and part of the requirements for this scholarship is to participate in online sessions . I understand that the school has a policy against phone usage at school , but I would like to respectfully request an exception in this case.Because l am a boarder at Gutu high school and phones are not allowed.  The scholarship is a great opportunity for me, and I would appreciate your understanding and consideration. Thank you for your time
