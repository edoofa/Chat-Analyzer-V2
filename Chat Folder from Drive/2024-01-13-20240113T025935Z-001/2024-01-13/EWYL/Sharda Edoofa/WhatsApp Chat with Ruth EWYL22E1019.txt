If you would have been following our messages, you might have come across to read about *SLICE-CON'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa) – an Industrial Visit* curated especially for our students next week. 

The visit is one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists, engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*

Your child has shared the confirmation to the official invitation that was sent from our end. Were you aware of the same and what do you think about this?
8/1/24, 10:16 AM - +263 77 264 7113: Was aware, it's quite good because it gives students a feel of what they would like to venture into after completing their studies.
👏👏👏👏👏

It's great to hear that you find career awareness valuable for students! Exploring potential career paths while still in school can indeed help students make more informed decisions about their future.

Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you few glimpses of this event.
