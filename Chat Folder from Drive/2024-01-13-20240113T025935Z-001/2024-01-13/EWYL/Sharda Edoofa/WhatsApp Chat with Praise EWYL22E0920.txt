3/1/24, 6:03 PM - +91 73031 08177: Good evening Ms Sharda, hope I find you well.

After going through the first Wednesday lesson for 2024, would like to say was a great one for a start.

In the pdf you sent above  I got to be enlightened more about the value that comes with participating in students events, seminar and workshops. Let me just brief it down;


Participating in workshops, seminars, and student activities provides a holistic learning experience, it also comes with  fostering skills beyond the academic realm therefore exposure comes into play. It cultivates networking, teamwork, and practical application of knowledge, enhancing overall personal and professional development.

I hope you are doing well 

Thank you for submitting your timely response to the Wednesdays lesson.

If you would have been following our messages, you might have come across to read about *SLICE-CON'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa) – an Industrial Visit* curated especially for our students next week. 

The visit is one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists, engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*

Your child has shared the confirmation to the official invitation that was sent from our end. Were you aware of the same and what do you think about this?
12/1/24, 3:33 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Praise!
