The visit is one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists, engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*

Your child has shared the confirmation to the official invitation that was sent from our end. Were you aware of the same and what do you think about this?

I hope you have settled back at your university after the extensive travel for our *SLICE-CON 24!*🚀

I am also particularly interested in learning about your preferences for future events and what topics you would like to explore. As a result, I am sharing a link to a feedback form here.🤝
