As we embark on today's session, let me share a motivational thought: *'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill.* This quote reminds us that every step, be it a triumph or a stumble, is part of our journey.

Now, tell me, how did you celebrate Christmas? I believe celebrations are not just about the festive season but also moments of personal victories and joy. How are you doing, and is there anything you'd like to share about your experiences during the holiday season? Let's explore the path ahead together.

27/12/23, 8:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Good Morning Ruvarashe*
As we gear up for our session, let's kick things off with a dose of motivation from Sundar Pichai:

"You might fail a few times, but that's Ok. You end up doing something worthwhile which you learn a great deal from." 🚀

In these powerful words, Pichai unveils the magic of embracing challenges. Failures aren't roadblocks but rather detours leading to invaluable lessons and remarkable achievements. 🌟

27/12/23, 8:51 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. We must have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - Sharda Edoofa: For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*
27/12/23, 8:52 AM - Sharda Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.
27/12/23, 8:54 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ohh okay I can't wait to learn more 😊
27/12/23, 8:54 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
27/12/23, 8:55 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay ma'am that's noted
27/12/23, 8:57 AM - +263 78 181 2643: But on Saturdays I'm m required to complete the tasks by what time since almost the entire day we will be attending church services
27/12/23, 9:00 AM - Sharda Edoofa: No, you are not supposed to submit the task on saturday. You can send the response before your next session which is either on Monday or Tuesday. So this should not be a concern.
27/12/23, 9:01 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ohh okay thank you for the clarification
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - Sharda Edoofa: You are very welcome please.

A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

27/12/23, 9:23 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes that is true.
27/12/23, 9:24 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, The entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
27/12/23, 9:26 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ohh yes its also my wish too

*🌌 "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning." - Albert Einstein 🌟*

As we delve into Einstein's insightful words, we're reminded of the dynamic journey of learning and growth. "Learn from yesterday" encourages reflection on past experiences, "live for today" emphasizes the present moment, and "hope for tomorrow" instills a forward-looking mindset.

In the context of your academic pursuit, this quote beckons you to embrace the continuous cycle of learning, applying knowledge in the present, and fostering hope for the future. Each question you pose becomes a stepping stone to new discoveries and personal development.

So, how are you doing today? 🌈 I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session. Let's turn challenges into opportunities and make this session truly worthwhile!

28/12/23, 8:55 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Is everything clear until now?
28/12/23, 8:56 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Yes now it's clear
28/12/23, 8:56 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great. Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
28/12/23, 8:57 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Is everything clear until now?
28/12/23, 8:57 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Yes ma'am it's all clear
28/12/23, 8:59 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ohh okay 🤔
28/12/23, 8:59 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay. Let us now move to the discussion of Project 2.
28/12/23, 9:00 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay ma'am I'm following

28/12/23, 9:00 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:00 AM - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.

28/12/23, 9:07 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Ruvarashe, I am waiting for you to share your understanding.
28/12/23, 9:10 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay I understood that this project is about reaching out to other students in different communities promoting social impact and helping them to also join the Edoofa community and acquire international education. Through using personal and extended networks Edoofa students will identify other motivated youths who also are looking to create great careers but don't have the necessary things to make them reach there and help them make it thereby creating an impact in the lives of others
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - Sharda Edoofa: That’s awesome- Ruvarashe, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - +263 78 181 2643: So you mean if I persuade some other student to join Edoofa and they pay the admission fee I get a scholarship credit? 🤔
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project. Are you ready?
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - Sharda Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, You have to share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they deserve to be Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ohh okay ma'am 😊

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
28/12/23, 9:19 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:19 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
28/12/23, 9:20 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay ma'am
28/12/23, 9:25 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio?
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay the audio is about creating a whatsapp group where I persuade other students to join the Edoofa program who are form sixes or have already completed their form 6 then I share information about Edoofa its benefits and why to choose it but I must make sure to add my Mentor in the group so as to guide me whilst sharing information with others
28/12/23, 9:27 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Yes ma'am I have
28/12/23, 9:27 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Ruvarashe, I am impressed with your understanding.
28/12/23, 9:28 AM - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
28/12/23, 9:28 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay ma'am 😊
28/12/23, 9:29 AM - +263 78 181 2643: So when should this begin
28/12/23, 9:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
28/12/23, 9:29 AM - Sharda Edoofa: You can start from right now.
28/12/23, 9:29 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ohh okay
28/12/23, 9:30 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
28/12/23, 9:31 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/12/23, 9:31 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:31 AM - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
28/12/23, 9:31 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:31 AM - Sharda Edoofa: This is very valuable information that you can definitely use while communicating with the students. Do you agree?
28/12/23, 9:34 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Yes ma'am I agree

28/12/23, 9:39 AM - Sharda Edoofa: *PROJECT 3: AFRICAN SCHOOL EDUCATION REFORM MISSION PROJECT*
28/12/23, 9:39 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
28/12/23, 9:39 AM - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:39 AM - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
28/12/23, 9:45 AM - +263 78 181 2643: The audio is about looking for African schools especially in my country, starting with my school where I ask the principal for permission to involve the students of that particular school in this program. I can also verify it by linking the principal with the Edoofa directors so that it may not seem as if it is fake
28/12/23, 9:47 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Ruvarashe.
28/12/23, 9:47 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.

28/12/23, 10:24 AM - +263 78 181 2643: 2. Dear Sir or Madam
I am Ruvarashe a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*I would also like my fellow brothers and sisters from your school to join me in grabbing this opportunity which rarely happens. Here students 
can complete their tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy since they have to undergo certain steps. Furthermore the Edoofa Scholarship program is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr G. M Chipare making it a safe platform. It would be a great honor if you would allow me to introduce this program into your school and help my fellow brothers and sisters who also have the desire to study abroad.

Thank you 🙏
28/12/23, 10:25 AM - +263 78 181 2643: 3. The school is located in Manicaland province
28/12/23, 10:40 AM - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
28/12/23, 10:44 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Yes I agree
28/12/23, 11:00 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
28/12/23, 11:07 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Ruvarashe, we are only left with a very less discussion on this project and then we will be done with the Initial training. 
I will be away for an hour from now on. Do let me know if you are available after that.
28/12/23, 12:43 PM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay ma'am I'm now available
28/12/23, 12:51 PM - +263 78 181 2643: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 1:07 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Okay great, thank you for sharing your confirmation.
28/12/23, 1:49 PM - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *Ruvarashe, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

28/12/23, 2:41 PM - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
28/12/23, 2:41 PM - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
28/12/23, 2:41 PM - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay ma'am
28/12/23, 2:51 PM - Sharda Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project, Except the fact that Project one is still on Hold. 
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.
Moreover, it is important that you make steady progress every day.
28/12/23, 2:52 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Is that clear, Ruvarashe?
28/12/23, 3:55 PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now that the time is over, we will continue with our discussion tomorrow. Thank you for your cooperation.
28/12/23, 7:26 PM - +263 78 181 2643: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 7:27 PM - +263 78 181 2643: Okay ma'am.. Thank you

Embark on a journey of wonder! Here's a riddle to spark your curiosity:
*"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"*

Can't wait to decode this mystery together in our today' session! 🕵️‍♂️✨
29/12/23, 8:25 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Good morning ma'am, I am doing well thank and how are you doing today?
29/12/23, 8:26 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ummm 🤔I'm still wondering
29/12/23, 8:39 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Isn't it time 🤔
29/12/23, 8:42 AM - Sharda Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I am doing good too, thank you so much for asking,
29/12/23, 8:44 AM - Sharda Edoofa: The answer to the riddle is "a cloud." Clouds appear to fly without wings, they can release rain, which may be considered a form of crying without eyes, and they block the sun, creating darkness.
29/12/23, 8:44 AM - Sharda Edoofa: Learning: Clouds play a crucial role in the Earth's atmosphere, affecting weather patterns and reflecting, absorbing, and transmitting solar radiation. Understanding these natural phenomena enhances our knowledge of meteorology and climate science. 🌦️📚
29/12/23, 8:49 AM - +263 78 181 2643: You are welcome
29/12/23, 8:49 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Ohh okay 🤔

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:51 PM - Sharda Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
7/1/24, 9:18 AM - +263 78 181 2643: Good day ma'am... Ohh wow that's wonderful I can't wait to hear the experiences and see the pictures
11/1/24, 4:49 PM - Sharda Edoofa: _Greetings of the day, Ruvarashe_!
Thank you very much! And your wait is finally over too. 

Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you few glimpses of this event. <This message was edited>
