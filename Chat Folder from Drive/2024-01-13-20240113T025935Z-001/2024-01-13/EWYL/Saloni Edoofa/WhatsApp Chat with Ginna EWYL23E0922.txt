11/1/24, 9:46 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Ginna and parents, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Saloni* and I will be your *EWYL mentor* now.

How are you?
11/1/24, 9:47 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I sincerely apologize for the delay in responding to your updates. Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Friday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more. The event was really grand, let me show you a short glimpse of one of the days. <This message was edited>

12/1/24, 1:48 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
12/1/24, 2:34 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to take forward with our discussions🫶🏻

Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.

Till then, have a great weekend🌺
