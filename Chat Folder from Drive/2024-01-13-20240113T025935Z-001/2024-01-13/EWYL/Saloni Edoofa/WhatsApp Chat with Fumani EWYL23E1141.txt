Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.

12/1/24, 2:16 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So Fumani, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 77 341 0203: My long-term goal is to become a successful lawyer, driven by a passion for justice and advocacy. I aspire to specialize in a field that aligns with my values, such as human rights or environmental law. I envision contributing to positive social change through legal expertise and dedication to ethical principles. To achieve this, I plan to pursue a rigorous legal education, gain practical experience through internships, and build a strong professional network. Ultimately, I aim to make a meaningful impact in the legal realm, using my skills to address complex issues and uphold the principles of fairness and equality.

The Earn While You Learn program will provide financial support crucial to my educational journey. By simultaneously earning and learning, I can alleviate the burden of tuition and gain practical experience in my chosen field. This program ensures a smoother path towards my academic goals, fostering a balanced approach to education and career development.
12/1/24, 2:38 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to take forward with our discussions🫶🏻
