12/1/24, 2:02 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
