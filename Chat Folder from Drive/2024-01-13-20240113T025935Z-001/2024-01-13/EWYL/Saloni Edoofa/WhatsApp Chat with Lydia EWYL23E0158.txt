Good evening _my proud edoofian and parents_!

On a very emotional, happy, and jolly note, I am happy to announce that it's time to roll up for our Christmas celebrations🎄. From tomorrow until Monday, our entire team will also be immersed in the festivities, celebrating this time with our families. 

I, your proud mentor, Ms. Saloni, want to wish you a Merry Christmas🎁. It would have been amazing if I were there with you in person, but I sincerely wish you all the happiness, love, joy, and cozy family time, and, yes, may all your wishes come true, just like mine did by having you as my wonderful student🥺♥️

Happy holidays! I am sure you are going to make the most of this time. 

And, wait, don't forget to share pictures of your celebration with me. 📸
23/12/23, 3:12 PM - +260 770496393: Thank you and same.
23/12/23, 4:30 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Also, let's make the most of the little time we have left and focus on the targets we set earlier for your goals. I'm also curious to hear about your progress in achieving the grant targets. How have you found the journey so far?🤝
27/12/23, 4:12 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Lydia,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year—a time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.

I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
27/12/23, 5:47 PM - +260 770496393: Is the grant and 300 dollar plan the same thing?
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening Lydia,
How are you?

29/12/23, 3:48 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻
