Edoofa organized a grand flagship event from Monday to Wednesday named *SLICE Con'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa*)🫱🏻‍🫲🏼 where our Indian Edoofians, representing partner universities,  immersed in a grand event _featuring CEOs and Marketing heads of multi-millionaire brands_📈, braced themselves for networking opportunities, internships, and more.

11/1/24, 1:52 PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure you will also experience all this very soon🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
11/1/24, 1:53 PM - Saloni Edoofa: So Chidochashe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
11/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 73 478 3724: I am Chidochashe's father. The current position is that schools in Zimbabwe opened on Tuesday this week. As we speak, Chidochashe is now at school. She attends a boarding school 100km away from home. The school does not permit learners to carry their gadgets to school. Because of this rule, Chidochashe is unable to respond in person probably till the 1st of April 2024 as schools close on 31 March 2024.
