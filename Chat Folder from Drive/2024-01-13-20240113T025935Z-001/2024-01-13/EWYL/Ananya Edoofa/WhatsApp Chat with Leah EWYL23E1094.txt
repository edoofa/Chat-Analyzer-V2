5/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, great! Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier. I was involved in a call with my students who will be presenting to prominent CEOs and entrepreneurs during a significant industrial visit scheduled for next week. Training them is crucial, especially since it's their first time participating in such an event.

We will reconnect in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not hold sessions over the weekend. Meanwhile, I am sharing a video with you. Wishing you a happy weekend!

6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨

11/1/24, 1:41 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Leah!

Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

11/1/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 821 9098: That's wonderful news you share with us thank you
11/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
11/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Good day to you ma’am , I’m really sorry about not being able to respond to you earlier. Schools have opened so I had lessons throughout the day and I’m really sorry for not notifying you. My sincere apologies. <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 78 536 5920: Oh this is lovely and wonderful ma’am 
I can see that these proud Indian Edoofians really enjoyed the visit from the pictures you have sent.
11/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 78 536 5920: My favorite hobbies are baking and singing.I love baking because I get to be creative in the kitchen and seeing how my recipes turn out. Plus, I love being able to share my creations with friends and family. It's a great way to show people how much I care about them. Also singing is a way for me to express myself and let out my emotions. It's like therapy for me, and it helps me relax and forget about my worries. I love the feeling of being totally immersed in a song and letting the music take over. Singing also gives me a sense of accomplishment and pride when I perform well.


Studying biology is my passion for it has opened my eyes to the amazing complexity and beauty of life on Earth. I've learned about the interconnectedness of all living things, and how everything is connected in some way. I've also gained a greater understanding of how my own body works, and what I can do to keep it healthy. 

One of my goals is being a biotechnologist, because I see the potential for it to make a real difference in the world. This field is helping solve on of the world’s biggest challenges like food security and developing ne treatments for diseases.I want to be part of the next generation of scientists who are using cutting-edge technologies to solve big problems. I know it will take hard work and dedication, but I'm ready to take on the challenge.



Thank you

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜

12/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 536 5920: That’s fine ma’am.
