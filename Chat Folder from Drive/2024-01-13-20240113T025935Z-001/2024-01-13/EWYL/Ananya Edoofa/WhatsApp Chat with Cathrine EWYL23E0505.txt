29/12/23, 12:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Cathrine!

The current session has commenced, and it appears you're not on your EWYL line. Is it challenging to be present on time? I've noticed a recurring need for reminders. Could we discuss the reason behind this?
29/12/23, 12:22 PM - +48 574 536 864: Good afternoon, she travelled to the countryside and network connectivity is terrible and that's the reason why she has not been active.
29/12/23, 12:25 PM - +48 574 536 864: Sincere apologies for that she will make ammends once she returns from the countryside.
