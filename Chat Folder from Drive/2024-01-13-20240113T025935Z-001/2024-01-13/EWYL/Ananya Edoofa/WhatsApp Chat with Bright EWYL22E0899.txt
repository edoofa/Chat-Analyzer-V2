27/12/23, 3:49 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, bright,

I hope this message finds you well amidst your ongoing exams. I couldn't help but notice that I haven't received a Christmas greeting from you. I understand that exam preparations are consuming much of your time and energy, but it's disheartening to see that you couldn't spare a couple of minutes to extend your wishes.

As your mentor, I've been supportive and have even provided you with holidays to dedicate to your exam preparations. However, it's disconcerting to witness a lack of acknowledgment or a brief moment taken to convey your holiday wishes.

Is there something on your mind, or is there a reason for this silence?
27/12/23, 4:08 PM - +91 79737 30374: Hello ma'am good evening how're you. I am doing well ma'am I was really wait to congratulate you happy new year not that the birth of Christ is not important but according to my faith I celebrate it every day because the birth of Christ is life but new year it's an achievement and a blessed from God
28/12/23, 4:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Bright!

I understand that things have not always aligned with how they are planned. It's life, dear; one will face many instances in their life. However, moving out of your comfort zone is something you do when you wish to move ahead in your life.

Being your mentor, I am always here to listen and help you. However, I understand that sometimes your mentor can also feel a bit neglected. Therefore, always try to answer or respond to whatever has been asked.
28/12/23, 4:29 PM - +91 79737 30374: I'm doing fine ma'am how's holiday treating you ma'am
28/12/23, 4:31 PM - +91 79737 30374: Thank you ma'am
31/12/23, 6:19 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_Cheers to a Sparkling New Year!❄️_*

As we end the year, your dedication is impressive! With exams done and the New Year approaching, embrace that fresh energy and positivity. Your well-planned thinking will shine as you find new ways to fund your education. Stay focused, stay determined, and get ready to achieve your goals.🌟

Wishing you a year ahead filled with joy and success. Also, as a New Year gift, we have an amazing *Industrial Visit* planned, so get ready for that as well! 

*Happy New Year in advance!* 🎉
