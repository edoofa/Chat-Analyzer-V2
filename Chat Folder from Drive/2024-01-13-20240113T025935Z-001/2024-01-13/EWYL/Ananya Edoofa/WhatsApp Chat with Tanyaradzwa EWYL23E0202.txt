6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanyaradzwa!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the *8th, 9th, and 10th of January*, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
6/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 705 3454: Ok ma'am thank you
11/1/24, 11:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanyaradzwa!

I hope you are doing well. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you this morning. Actually, I was sorting out some pictures and videos for you. Let us do one thing, for today let us connect today at 1:30 pm and I will share a lot about our three-day event!

Is that alright?
11/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 705 3454: It's alright ma'am
11/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Before beginning our session, I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
11/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 78 705 3454: It was really good ma'am
12/1/24, 8:35 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanyaradzwa!

Let us begin our session with a fact! Did you know that the total weight of ants on Earth is comparable to the total weight of all the humans on this planet? It's a staggering reminder of the incredible diversity and abundance of life around us.🤯🐜
12/1/24, 9:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I was hoping to hear from you however since our session time is over, we shall connect in our next session.

Since we don't have sessions over the weekend, let's reconnect on Monday. See you then!🚀
