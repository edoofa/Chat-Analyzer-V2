5/1/24, 5:19 PM - +263 71 401 8032: Ooh it is nice to interact with you ma'am . Yes ma'am I am ready to join you on this journey .
5/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 71 401 8032: The second slot will work ma'am though there might be some problems in meeting this time since I will be at school at that time and also we are not allowed to use mobile phones at school.
5/1/24, 5:46 PM - +263 77 388 8622: Hello Ms Ananya, how are you and work. Here we are fine. I am happy to interact with you on this platform. My name is Walter Mushambi and l am Wynne's parent/father. Thank you for the scheduled times for the sessions with Wynne. However during these times or hours he will be at school and the school does not allow him to have a phone at school. May you kindly help by having the sessions with him from 3:30 pm to 4:30 pm. By this time he will be now at home where he will be now free to use the phone. May you kindly help on this one  so that Wynne will not lose any of your sessions and also so that the school not treat him as someone who is mischievous.
11/1/24, 11:36 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263773888622 

Kindly excuse me for the short delay. I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.

Not only this, but we also welcomed various industrial leaders, and it went super well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.
