I'm disappointed to see that you missed today's session. It's crucial to be responsible and attend on time. A lack of punctuality affects not just your progress but also the overall effectiveness of our mentoring. Let's take this seriously, and I expect better attendance in the future. Punctuality is a non-negotiable part of our commitment. Ensure you're on time for our next session.

I am sorry ...i have been occupied lately...i promise to make a change....& will make sure to attend today's session in time...
I also have a request to make...is it possible for me to be attending the sessions at 9:00 am CAT??...because i find it hard to attend at 12:00 since i also have to prepare lunch for the family & do other household chores?...
Let me know if it will be possible...i'll respect anything you say Madam...Once again i am sorry for missing the session.

Please accept my apologies for the delayed response. I was engaged in our three-day-long industrial visit, SLICE-CON!
12/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, don't worry! We can reschedule your session for 9:30 a.m!
