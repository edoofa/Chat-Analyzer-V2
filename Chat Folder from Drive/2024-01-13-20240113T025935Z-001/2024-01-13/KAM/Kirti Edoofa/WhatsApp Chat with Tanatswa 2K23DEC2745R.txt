10/1/24, 5:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
10/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Yes maam
10/1/24, 5:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 5:45 PM - +263 77 799 8533: We can proceed
10/1/24, 5:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
10/1/24, 5:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
10/1/24, 6:11 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Yes they are clear
10/1/24, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
10/1/24, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
10/1/24, 6:16 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Yes
10/1/24, 6:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
10/1/24, 6:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
10/1/24, 6:18 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Yes they are clear
10/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
10/1/24, 6:58 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Yes  ma'am
10/1/24, 6:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
10/1/24, 6:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

10/1/24, 8:16 PM - +263 77 799 8533: The first video  is an urge by the co founders that students should  be open minded and they must be able to follow  instructions  given  by the admission office at all costs 

The second video elaborates further  on the Edoofa vison , which is to  make education affordable  for all .² to increase the success  of students and at the same time  promoting students towards  being responsible  people .³the program provides a safe and secure  community and a good learning environment for the students .

The third  video , shows how Edoofa has managed  to select  the best schools in india  for the scholarship  fund ,¹ they look for schools that have safe  accommodation  systems and good learning  environments, ²schools that support  cultural  morals ,³ these schools will be good that they ensure students have the right attitudes and the good  confidence in the business  world in a few years to come

The fourth video has made ¹emphasis on good documentation  stating that the students must always have their documentation  safe secure and ready 
²And has made it clear that students must always be prompt with their  forms during filling  and must never make the admissions wait
10/1/24, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
10/1/24, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
10/1/24, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
10/1/24, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
10/1/24, 8:19 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Noted thanks
10/1/24, 8:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
10/1/24, 8:39 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Yes ma'am
10/1/24, 8:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job.

11/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 77 799 8533: ²HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT AND HOW CAN YOU CONTRIBUTE TO IT THROUGH  THE CAREER  YOU WANT TO BUILD AS AN ENGINEER 

Zimbabwe  is a country  that is still on the verge of developing  and looking  at a picture whereby the world  is shifting  from being a mechanical one being a technical one , engineers  are being crucial in the day  to day running of almost everything.As an engineer i would  start by working  on programs that can change the society  .
Instead of using fossils from Hwange ,the hydroelectric power station  in Kariba only to make electricity  for the whole country   i would improve by using projects that  use more renewable  sources of energy  such as the solar system  and the wind  adding on to the hydro  ,hence  helping  on reducing  the countries dependence on fossils  thereby contributing  to a more sustainable  future .
 Since almost everything   now required  electricity  , engineers  are helping  to develop infastructure  that is required to transmit and distribute  electricity  to every cranny of home and business and every nook. However i as engineers  i would  suggest  that most of the transformers we use must be step up transformer and ideal  so that electricity  consumption  is  made less daily  . I would also implement that  powerlines and substations must be made to each other , that way  electricity  can travel longer distances without being  stepped up or down .
As an engineer  i have overlooked  the fact that we live with disabled people  in the society  so we can try by all means to make prosthetic aids made from plastics , aluminum, titanium and silicone  to make their bodies  work better since design  is one of our strengths .
I firmly believe that  by implementing  some of the stated above  we can towards building  a better  civilized and develop  Zimbabwe.
11/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 799 8533: ³WHICH IS YOUR DREAM COMPANY TO WORK FOR AND WHY 

As an upcoming  electrical engineer i would  love to work at the Zimbabwe Electrical Supply Authority (ZESA)because  it's subsidiary  the ZETDC (Zimbabwe Transmission and Distribution Company) that is responsible  for all the transmission  of electricity from power stations,the distribution of electricity as well as its retailing to end users , ny providing affosafe and reliable electricity.  The salary is good and reasonable  and i believe  i can get a chance to  upgrade  my ranking at ZESA
11/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 799 8533: ⁴WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN  ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 

-ELECTONIC SYSTEM 
these are systems  designed to process electrical  signals,non electrical  signals are converted into electrical forms by input sensing devices such as buzzers ,switch  ,alarm etc. 

-ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS 
these are systems that involves  the generation  , transmission and distribution of electricity 
Such as powerplants , transformers and house hole wiring systems
11/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 799 8533: ⁵EXPLAIN HOW A CAPACITOR WORK 

-A capacitor is aa electrical device that stores and discharges  charge in a complete circuit .it is made up of two parallel  plates which are equal sized and oppositely charges. The two plates are Insulated by a material  called a dielectric material  which can either be ceramic , mica, paper or air. Capacitors can either  be connected  in series or in parallel .
In a parallel connection current varies but voltage remains constant therefore the charge on the capacitor will be varying and increasing 
In a series  connecting  current  remains constant  but  Voltage varies and there  the charge on the capacitors  is decreasing.
The energy  that is stored in a capacitor is equal  to the workdone in charging the capacitor because when  the first charge  flows on the capacitor plate there is no potential  difference  opposing the flow .In a direct current  circuit, a capacitor acts like an open circuit when it is fully charged or discharged ,this means thst no current  flows through  it .In an alternating current circuit , a capacitor acts likea resistor that depends on the  charge frequency on the alternatind current source .
A capacitor is also used to smoothen  alternatiing current  to a steady  direct current  by connecting  it to a full wave bridge rectifier in parallel. A capacitor  is also used to reduce noise  in a transformer. They are also used to maintain  voltage  in a circuit  at a certain  level .

11/1/24, 1:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward I have some news to share with you. 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/DQS9HtEs5dpFIqH4Etd1yr

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Mupfukudzwa Tanatswa Lisa, and my EWYL group name is Tanatswa EWYL23E1145. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 16/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
11/1/24, 1:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
11/1/24, 1:36 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Noted
11/1/24, 1:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Tech (Electrical Engineering) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
12/1/24, 12:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Tanatswa,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you yesterday. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
12/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Yes ma'am
12/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Yes we are still in communication
12/1/24, 12:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/1/24, 12:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to connect with you today. Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
12/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 71 929 6609: Yes
12/1/24, 1:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/1/24, 1:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/1/24, 1:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/1/24, 1:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 799 8533: I agree
12/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/1/24, 1:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Correct
12/1/24, 1:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Yes ma'am  we are on the same  page
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
12/1/24, 1:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Oh okay noted
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
12/1/24, 1:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/1/24, 1:40 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Noted
12/1/24, 1:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/1/24, 1:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/1/24, 1:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/1/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 799 8533: How much are the visa and flight expenses  roughly
12/1/24, 1:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and visa fee is $83.
12/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 799 8533: Okay
12/1/24, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/1/24, 1:49 PM - +263 77 799 8533: I have none , will to actually  confirm  with my parents
12/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
12/1/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India.

This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
