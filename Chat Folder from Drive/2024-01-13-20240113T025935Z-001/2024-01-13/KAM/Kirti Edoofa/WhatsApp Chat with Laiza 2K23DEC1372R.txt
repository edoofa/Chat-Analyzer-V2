27/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Let's begin

27/12/23, 5:05 PM - +263 71 582 8724: For the confirmation letter the school authorities are not at the station they are  closed up until 5 January
27/12/23, 5:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, you can share the letter of recommendation after 5th of January and share the remaining academic documents for now.
27/12/23, 5:26 PM - +263 71 582 8724: Fine she is doing
27/12/23, 5:29 PM - +263 71 582 8724: There is this 500-1000 deposit which you say will be paid some weeks after receiving offer letter ,  are we the one who are going to pay
27/12/23, 5:42 PM - +263 71 947 4887: I am facing some difficulties to fill the forms left so which one is the appropriate application to use for filling the fos
27/12/23, 5:42 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Forms
27/12/23, 6:23 PM - +263 71 947 4887: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 6:23 PM - +263 71 947 4887: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 6:23 PM - +263 71 947 4887: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 6:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please you are correct. This $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
27/12/23, 6:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents, I shall wait for your response to the forms.
27/12/23, 6:52 PM - +263 71 582 8724: The period you want this money is too short for us i earn 125us per month
27/12/23, 6:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand however, please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 7:13 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Clear
28/12/23, 7:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 7:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 7:37 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes I am following
28/12/23, 7:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/12/23, 7:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/12/23, 7:51 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Clear
28/12/23, 7:52 PM - +263 71 947 4887: So is there any amount needed to be payed after paying the registration fee
28/12/23, 7:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern. Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ok let's proceed
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/12/23, 7:57 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ues
28/12/23, 7:57 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes
28/12/23, 8:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/12/23, 8:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
28/12/23, 8:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
28/12/23, 8:15 PM - +263 71 947 4887: I'm ready
28/12/23, 8:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

28/12/23, 8:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
28/12/23, 8:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
28/12/23, 8:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
28/12/23, 9:20 PM - +263 71 947 4887: I will go through them tonight when my internet connection is ok
28/12/23, 9:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright, please let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm. I hope you will be available.
29/12/23, 12:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Laiza,

I hope this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday?
29/12/23, 1:36 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ok
29/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you were able to go through videos by now?
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes
29/12/23, 2:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
29/12/23, 2:02 PM - +263 71 947 4887: The first video was talking about following instructions and being open minded
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the remaining videos.
29/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 71 947 4887: The second one Edoofa main aim is to make students succeed in life and get employment while they have experience .It also wants people to get education at an affordable price
29/12/23, 2:09 PM - +263 71 947 4887: The third one ....founders are emphasising that students must follow instructions so that they qualify into the institution
29/12/23, 2:10 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Lastly the SOP students must fill the forms promptly
29/12/23, 2:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
29/12/23, 2:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/12/23, 2:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/12/23, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/12/23, 2:16 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Thank you
29/12/23, 2:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
29/12/23, 2:17 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes we do
29/12/23, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tuesday 01:30 PM.
29/12/23, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
29/12/23, 2:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the task that has been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
29/12/23, 2:27 PM - +263 71 947 4887: What if I complete them today is there any problem
29/12/23, 2:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No please, there is no problem at all if you can complete the task today it is great.
29/12/23, 2:39 PM - +263 71 947 4887: I'm done
29/12/23, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form it is duly noted with us. Before we move ahead I have a piece of news to share with you. 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/LTCNmO49b0YH2TSRCOCeMG

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Laiza Kubvaruno, and my EWYL group name is Laiza EWYL23E1077. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 02/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
29/12/23, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
29/12/23, 3:35 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ok
29/12/23, 3:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
29/12/23, 3:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
29/12/23, 3:39 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes
29/12/23, 3:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
29/12/23, 3:42 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/12/23, 3:59 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes
29/12/23, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
29/12/23, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
29/12/23, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
29/12/23, 8:15 PM - +263 71 947 4887: , yes
29/12/23, 8:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
29/12/23, 8:46 PM - +263 71 582 8724: We understood what you ssid on fees but we can't raise this amount at once but on an installments
29/12/23, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263715828724 I understand that completely. Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
29/12/23, 8:53 PM - +263 71 582 8724: Ok we can
29/12/23, 9:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
29/12/23, 9:11 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ok
29/12/23, 9:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
29/12/23, 9:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
29/12/23, 10:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Laiza,

I hope this message finds you in good health and you had a delightful New Year. With regard to our conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
2/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ok
2/1/24, 3:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to connect with you, may I know if you have any queries so far?
2/1/24, 5:58 PM - +263 71 947 4887: No queries
2/1/24, 6:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
2/1/24, 6:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
2/1/24, 6:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
2/1/24, 6:02 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ok
2/1/24, 6:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/1/24, 6:35 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Not  at all
2/1/24, 6:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
2/1/24, 6:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
2/1/24, 6:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
2/1/24, 6:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 7:10 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ok
2/1/24, 7:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
2/1/24, 7:13 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Wonderful
2/1/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
2/1/24, 7:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

2/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Done
2/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -

*1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

2/1/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
2/1/24, 7:25 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ok
2/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
2/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
2/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 7:29 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes it does
2/1/24, 7:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
2/1/24, 7:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 7:32 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes
2/1/24, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
2/1/24, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/1/24, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
2/1/24, 9:17 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Noted
2/1/24, 9:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
2/1/24, 9:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
3/1/24, 1:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Laiza,

I hope this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
3/1/24, 3:12 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes
3/1/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so may I know if you are clear so far and do you need more information about the same?
3/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Not at all
3/1/24, 3:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, when a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
3/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
3/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
3/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
3/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes
3/1/24, 5:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
3/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes
3/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 71 947 4887: What if you attain 10 to 15 points at A level
3/1/24, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, as mentioned above if a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.
3/1/24, 6:10 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ok
3/1/24, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, now I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
3/1/24, 6:14 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes
3/1/24, 6:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
3/1/24, 6:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
3/1/24, 6:15 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Noted
3/1/24, 6:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
3/1/24, 6:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
3/1/24, 6:48 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes
3/1/24, 6:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
3/1/24, 6:50 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ok
3/1/24, 6:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
3/1/24, 6:51 PM - +263 71 947 4887: No questions
3/1/24, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
3/1/24, 6:54 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Oh yes
3/1/24, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
3/1/24, 6:57 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Ok thank you so much
3/1/24, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Have a blessed evening ahead.
3/1/24, 6:58 PM - +263 71 947 4887: And to you tooo
8/1/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Laiza.
