I trust you're all in good health. I'm following up on our previous conversation, as the second deadline is drawing near. I'm reaching out to check on your preparations for this and to inquire about your plans, especially considering the upcoming festival season. Could you please let me know which date you have in mind to make the payment for the second deadline?

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Yes, please I will be more than happy to help you?

12/1/24, 4:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263773589903 thank you for your query, even if Munyaradzi stays in an off- campus accommodation the off-campus accommodation also provides the food so you do not have to worry about it.
