I trust this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admission Officer at Edoofa.* I would like to inform you that Mr. Shivjeet will no longer be available, as he is advancing in his career with a new opportunity. While his departure is a loss for us, we are also filled with pride and joy for his future endeavors. Moving forward, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction.

Since your last discussion with Mr. Shivjeet, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents today at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
