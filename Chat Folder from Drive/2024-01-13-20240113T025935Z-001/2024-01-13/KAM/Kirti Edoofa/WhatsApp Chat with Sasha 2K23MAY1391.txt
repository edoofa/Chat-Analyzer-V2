12/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, I am aware of that. We also had the pleasure of conversing with some of our students as well.

Reflecting on my own school days, I vividly recall the mix of excitement and anticipation surrounding the result day. It is an important moment that shapes the path of one’s academic
12/1/24, 8:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
12/1/24, 8:30 PM - +263 78 814 0469: Okay Sir but l didn't made it 😭😭😭😭😭😭

12/1/24, 9:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I understand that your A-level results didn't turn out as you had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.

It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
12/1/24, 9:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please know that you have our full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative paths, or just needing someone to talk to, we are here for you. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
