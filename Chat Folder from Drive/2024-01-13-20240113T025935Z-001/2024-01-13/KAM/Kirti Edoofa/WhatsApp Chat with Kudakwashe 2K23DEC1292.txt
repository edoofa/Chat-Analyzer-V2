I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
5/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Let's start
5/1/24, 3:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/1/24, 3:53 PM - +263 77 650 5799: I'm done
5/1/24, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
5/1/24, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
5/1/24, 4:05 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes they are clear
5/1/24, 4:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
5/1/24, 4:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
5/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 77 650 5799: I'm following
5/1/24, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
5/1/24, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
5/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes it's clear
5/1/24, 4:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

6/1/24, 12:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
6/1/24, 12:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
6/1/24, 12:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
6/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Thank you for explaining

6/1/24, 8:56 PM - +263 77 650 5799: 2 . The scope of medical laboratory technology is quite broad, as it encompasses a wide range of tasks and responsibilities. Medical lab technicians play a vital role in the healthcare field, performing a variety of tests and procedures to help diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. They may work in hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare settings, performing tasks such as collecting and analyzing blood, urine, and tissue samples; preparing specimens for testing; operating and maintaining laboratory equipment; and ensuring the accuracy of test results. With the ever-growing demand for medical lab technicians, the scope of this field is only expected to expand in the years to comeThere are many reasons why medical laboratory technology is important. First, medical lab technicians play a vital role in diagnosing and treating illness. Without accurate and timely testing, it would be much more difficult for doctors to make an accurate diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. Second, medical lab technology helps to ensure the safety of patients. By testing for pathogens and other harmful substances, lab technicians can help to prevent the spread of disease and protect patients from dangerous side effects. Finally, medical lab technology is important for research and development.   diseases.
6/1/24, 9:04 PM - +263 77 650 5799: 3 . Good laboratory practice (GLP) is a set of principles and procedures that help to ensure the quality and reliability of laboratory testing. GLP covers all aspects of lab work, from design and planning to execution, analysis, and reporting of results. The purpose of GLP is to minimize the risk of error or fraud in the lab, and to help ensure that test results are accurate and can be trusted. Labs that follow GLP must adhere to specific standards and procedures, and are subject to regular audits and inspections. GLP is an important part of ensuring the safety and efficacy of products like medicines and medical devices. There are several reasons why good laboratory practice is so important in the lab. First, as I have  mentioned, GLP helps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of test results. This is critical, as inaccurate or unreliable results can have serious consequences for patients and consumers. Second, GLP helps to protect the integrity of the scientific process. By following established procedures and maintaining a high level of quality control, lab technicians can be confident that their work is accurate and reproducible. Third, GLP helps to protect lab workers and the public from the risks associated with handling dangerous materials and equipment.

6/1/24, 9:21 PM - +263 77 650 5799: 4 .There are several sterilization methods commonly used in the lab. One of the most common methods is autoclaving, which uses high temperatures and pressure to kill microorganisms. Other methods include filtration, radiation, and chemical sterilization. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method will depend on factors such as the type of material being sterilized, the size and shape of the object, and the level of sterility required. There are important because sterilization is a crucial step in maintaining a safe and sterile environment in the lab. Proper sterilization helps to prevent contamination, which can ruin experiments and potentially cause serious harm to people and the environment. For example, if microorganisms are allowed to grow in a lab, they can spread to other materials and equipment, causing contamination and potentially resulting in the spread of disease. Additionally, sterilization is important for the integrity of research, as contamination can skew results and lead to inaccurate conclusions. Proper sterilization is therefore essential for the safety and accuracy of lab work. Autoclaving is an example of a  sterilization method that uses high temperatures and pressure to kill microorganisms. The most common type of autoclave is the steam autoclave, which uses steam heated to 121-134 degrees Celsius under high pressure to kill microorganisms. The high temperature causes the proteins in the microorganisms to denature, or break down, and the pressure ensures that all parts of the material are exposed to the heat. Autoclaving is an effective method of sterilization that is used in many labs, hospitals, and other settings where sterile conditions are important.
6/1/24, 9:32 PM - +263 77 650 5799: 5 .There are several techniques for placing samples under a microscope, depending on the type of sample and the type of microscope being used. One common technique is called wet-mounting, which involves placing the sample on a slide, adding a drop of water or other liquid, and then placing a cover slip on top. This technique is often used for transparent or semi-transparent samples such as cells, tissues, or blood smears. Another technique, called dry-mounting, involves placing the sample directly on a slide without adding liquid. This technique is often used for hard, dry samples such as leaves or feathers.Another technique is staining, which involves adding colored dyes to the sample to make certain features more visible. For example, some dyes are used to stain cell nuclei, while others are used to stain cell walls. Another technique is called negative staining, which involves staining everything except the sample itself. This makes it easier to see the outline of the sample. Additionally, some samples may require special preparation, such as slicing or fixation, before they can be viewed under a microscope.
8/1/24, 2:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe.

So once they respond back, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
8/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 77 650 5799: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Oky I will
8/1/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
8/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes you correct
8/1/24, 2:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
8/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yeah let's move
8/1/24, 2:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of the Edoofa Enrollment fee before 20th January 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
8/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes my parents are working on it
8/1/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better,
8/1/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Noted mam
8/1/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
8/1/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
8/1/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
8/1/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
8/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes that's impossible
8/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Noted mam
8/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
8/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
8/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
8/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Noted
8/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes we did discuss abt it
8/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
8/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yeah we on the same page
8/1/24, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
8/1/24, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
8/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yeah I have noted it
8/1/24, 3:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
8/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes it's noted
8/1/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
8/1/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
8/1/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
8/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes noted
8/1/24, 3:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
8/1/24, 3:41 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Got no queries mam
8/1/24, 3:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
8/1/24, 3:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
8/1/24, 3:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
8/1/24, 3:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 3:48 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Wow this is amazing
8/1/24, 3:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed it was heartwarming to meet them, I hope you are excited to be in this picture for next year?
8/1/24, 4:11 PM - +263 77 650 5799: I'm so excited
8/1/24, 4:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
8/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Thank you so much
8/1/24, 4:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
8/1/24, 4:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
8/1/24, 4:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
8/1/24, 4:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
8/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 650 5799: I'm done
8/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
8/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
8/1/24, 4:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
8/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Noted mam
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
8/1/24, 4:40 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes it does
8/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
8/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
8/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Understood
8/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
8/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
8/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - +263 77 650 5799: It's clear
8/1/24, 4:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
8/1/24, 5:00 PM - +263 77 650 5799: You can tell me more
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
8/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yeah that's correct
8/1/24, 5:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
8/1/24, 5:18 PM - +263 77 650 5799: That would be impossible
8/1/24, 5:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
8/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Ohhhh I understand
8/1/24, 5:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
8/1/24, 5:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
8/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 77 650 5799: It's clear
8/1/24, 5:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
8/1/24, 5:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
8/1/24, 5:23 PM - +263 77 650 5799: We clear
8/1/24, 5:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
8/1/24, 5:28 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Ohh oky
8/1/24, 5:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
8/1/24, 5:29 PM - +263 77 650 5799: No queries so far
8/1/24, 5:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
8/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 77 650 5799: Yes I am
8/1/24, 5:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
