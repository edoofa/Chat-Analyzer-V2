And happy new year. 
Am making a follow up if there has been a response from any university you sent Sijamali's application. 
It'd been a while and we have not heard from you regarding the same. 
Thank you.
5/1/24, 4:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and SIjamali.

I hope you are doing well and had a wonderful New Year celebration thank you for your wish. I understand your concern here however, this is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
5/1/24, 7:21 PM - +260 96 2284130: Thank you for your response. 
More time indeed I need. 
You are absolutely right.
5/1/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a wonderful evening ahead!
5/1/24, 7:33 PM - +260 96 2284130: Thank you.  Stay blessed.

I hope this message finds you well. It has been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'* 

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 4:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 4:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
12/1/24, 4:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to share a glimpse of the conference, and I hope you too are excited to attend such events when you come to India.
