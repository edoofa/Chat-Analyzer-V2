8/1/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
8/1/24, 4:21 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: It’s clear
8/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
8/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
8/1/24, 4:28 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Just to be clear on step two it means l will be communicating with a number of universities to get the offer letter from the multiple number of colleges as step 4 says?
8/1/24, 4:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern, however, please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
8/1/24, 4:36 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: It’s now clear let’s move on
8/1/24, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
8/1/24, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
8/1/24, 4:42 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: It’s clear
8/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
8/1/24, 4:48 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes let’s proceed
8/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
8/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
8/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Let’s proceed
8/1/24, 4:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
8/1/24, 4:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
8/1/24, 4:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
8/1/24, 4:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
8/1/24, 4:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
8/1/24, 4:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
8/1/24, 5:13 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: From this video l have learnt that l need to be person who follows instructions and is open minded just as the 12 year boy was as he was not afraid to ask for help from the CEO of HP and the boy got helped and so is opening up my mind to Edoofa scholarship going to help me to archive my dreams
8/1/24, 5:28 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: From this l learn that following instructions is the key for one’s success as the founder tried to compare with the suggestions of these other two students that he met
8/1/24, 5:46 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: I have also learnt the aspect of Edoofa being present with their students through out the scholarship program as the founder said it that we need to take them as our parents
8/1/24, 5:49 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: I learn that Edoofa makes sure that their students get to universities that do not focus on making profits out of education but seeing that their students archive their goals and the founder gave an example of that university that had it walls not painted which shows that this university was just there to make a profit
8/1/24, 5:55 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: From this l learn that l have to be a person who will follow instructions as this will enable me to get the rightful scholarship that l desire
8/1/24, 6:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
8/1/24, 6:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
8/1/24, 6:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
8/1/24, 6:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
8/1/24, 7:46 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Thank you for the help it’s no more clear
8/1/24, 7:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
8/1/24, 7:53 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: We are together let’s proceed
8/1/24, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
8/1/24, 7:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

9/1/24, 2:40 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Wishing you a soon recovery
10/1/24, 12:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Kelvin,

I trust this message finds you well. Thank you for your kind words I am feeling much better now. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation and inquire if you're currently available to connect with us. This would allow us to continue our discussion as we had originally planned.
10/1/24, 12:44 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Good afternoon am doing fine and am glad to hear that you are also doing fine
10/1/24, 12:46 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: On our previous meeting we stopped here that l need to research and answer these five questions that were brought forward to me
10/1/24, 12:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is good to know you are doing fine as well. Yes please so may I know if you were able to complete your tasks?
10/1/24, 12:50 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes l have completed it

10/1/24, 12:52 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: In 15 minutes time l can be able to submit the work
10/1/24, 12:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please Kelvin take your time, I shall wait for your response.
10/1/24, 1:00 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 1:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing question 1, it is well noted. I shall wait for your response to the other questions.
10/1/24, 1:17 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Question 2 :

Cavitation is the formation of air bubbles is a fluid this occurs when the fluid pressure condition is lower than the saturation pressure. According to the Bernoulli’s equation at high flow velocity the pressure head of a fluid is reduced accordingly.when the fluid pressure is less than saturation pressure, dissolved gases are released from the fluid and these air bubbles will suddenly collapse when the flow enters into a region of high pressure. This produces a high dynamic pressure which causes damage to the pipelines and the walls of the drains due to its high frequency when the bubbles have collapse. Cavitation in pipes is usually brought when the pumps circulate water around the pipes. This is due to the lower pressure at the inlet of pumps and the narrow section of pipes. The thing that can easily the seen that cavitation is indeed taking place is the situation where we see the propellers of the pump being eaten up after a long time of usage and even the walls of the drains and pipes getting eaten up. This is due to the collapsing of the cavitation buddies which makes the energy released in them to cause some damage
10/1/24, 1:20 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Question 3 :

Soil reinforcement is the act of improving the soil strength to enable it to carry and support more load. This can be done by mixing soil amendments for example lime to a weak clayey d soil and re compacting to improve the soil bearing capacity. The importance of soil reinforcement is that enables buildings not to collapse the ground as the soil is able to support the building to stand on the ground after being reinforced. Some of the major causes of buildings to collapse are : first OVERLOADING just as cars and even human beings can only carry a certain amount of load buildings are also designed to carry a certain amount of load on them and more load can lead to them collapsing as they can not withstand the pressure and an example of this incident the collapsing of a certain hospital in Bagaladeshi . The second cause is MATERIAL DETERIORATION this occurs due to chemical changes in building materials for example rust burst that cause the building materials to loss their strength and are not able to support the other building materials. The third cause is NATURAL DISASTERS for example earthquakes, during this incident energy is released which is transmitted into the building which causes the building to shake and cracks are formed then the building starts to collapse. The fourth cause is GROUND SETTLING, when buildings are constructed on soft soil or marsh land , these buildings can easily sink into the soil making them to collapse an example it the situation where we see people sinking into the ground on when they are on marshes or muddy grounds because the soil can not withstand the pressure being exerted by the person.
10/1/24, 1:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the remaining questions.
10/1/24, 1:22 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Question 4 :

The MIVAN construction is one of the modern ways of costructing buildings under civil engineering. This method was invented to replace the be method where bricks were used to make buildings in either multi story buildings or just small houses. The way the MIVAN construction process is done by putting concrete on the ground where the building is going to stand and then steel bars are raised following the boundary of the building. Then aluminum form works are then fixed around the steel bars in which high quality concrete is poured making a mold and then the aluminum form works are removed after the concrete has dried up. This is also done on the other flow of the building until when the number of the wanted flows are archived . This method is mostly used in the morden construction as it saves costs as no plastering is required when the building is done and unskilled labor can also be able to do these constructions which redused the cost, there is high quality construction and it is a fast way of construction as bricks are not used which takes a lot of time to align the bricks together. The MIVAN construction is used in the construction of upstair buildings and simple houses and even construction of bridges and other overground roads.
10/1/24, 1:23 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Question 5 :

As the name stands pre fabrication. The word pre means doing something before the actual thing. So in simple words pre fabrication is the construction of building components in a factory or a manufacturing industry and then assembled to the construction site. In pre fabrication the materials are made in safe environment where are conditions are well controlled for example warehouse. These materials are then transported to the construction site where they are fixed into their positions. An example can be construction of bathrooms pods in a warehouse and then transporting them to the construction site. This technique is used in large infrastructure projects as it reduces wastes on the construction site as the materials are only fixed into their positions. This also improves the safety of the workers just as in the situation where an engineer had to climb multi story buildings to fix glasses but instead of that the glasses are already fixed for the engineer. Pre fabrication also saves time as the the fixing of these materials does not take time making the projects to be finished on time. It also increases quality of the construction.
10/1/24, 1:23 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Am done with all the questions
10/1/24, 2:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you have any updates to share about the JCE reference letter?
10/1/24, 3:04 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: My father is still working on that so l think l may have the response tomorrow
10/1/24, 3:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @265984007130 Alright please, in that case, you can share the letter by tomorrow. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
10/1/24, 3:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Tech (Civil Engineering) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
10/1/24, 3:16 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes that’s correct
10/1/24, 3:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
10/1/24, 3:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 1-Feb-2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
10/1/24, 3:29 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: I will make sure to remind my parents about the payment
10/1/24, 3:29 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes l have been able to align my preparation
10/1/24, 3:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
10/1/24, 3:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education. <This message was edited>
10/1/24, 3:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
10/1/24, 3:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
10/1/24, 3:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
10/1/24, 3:35 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes am sure about that
10/1/24, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
10/1/24, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
10/1/24, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
10/1/24, 4:25 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes he did
10/1/24, 4:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
10/1/24, 5:09 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes we are
10/1/24, 5:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
10/1/24, 5:30 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Noted
10/1/24, 5:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
10/1/24, 5:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000 = $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $400 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
10/1/24, 6:07 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Noted
10/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
10/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
10/1/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

10/1/24, 7:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/1/24, 7:05 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: So far everything is clear so we can proceed
10/1/24, 7:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/1/24, 7:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
10/1/24, 7:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
10/1/24, 7:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 7:19 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Thank for the picture am glad to see that a lot are indeed happy to be Edoofians as l am able to see the smile on all those students
10/1/24, 8:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, it was wonderful meeting them, I hope you are excited to be in the picture for the next year?
10/1/24, 8:17 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes l can’t wait to meet them and hear more about their lives as being Edoofians and even to be in the picture with the 2024 intake students
10/1/24, 8:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
10/1/24, 8:19 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: It will be my pleasure to work with Edoofa for my bright future
10/1/24, 8:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
10/1/24, 8:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
10/1/24, 8:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/1/24, 8:22 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: I have gone through them
10/1/24, 8:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/1/24, 8:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, Msce and Jce results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
10/1/24, 8:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
10/1/24, 8:29 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Noted
10/1/24, 8:29 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Let’s proceed
10/1/24, 8:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/1/24, 8:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/1/24, 8:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/1/24, 8:32 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes l get it
10/1/24, 8:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
10/1/24, 8:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/1/24, 8:39 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: It’s clear
10/1/24, 8:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/1/24, 8:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/1/24, 8:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/1/24, 8:46 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Everything is clear so far with the examples l can now understand it better
10/1/24, 8:47 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: We can continue there are no questions
10/1/24, 8:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
10/1/24, 8:50 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: I am excited for the next step
10/1/24, 8:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/1/24, 8:57 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: I will make sure to share this with my family
10/1/24, 8:57 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Have a blessed day too
12/1/24, 11:44 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kelvin.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you have any updates on the JCE reference letter by now?
12/1/24, 11:45 AM - +265 984 00 71 30: Good afternoon Madam Kirti a, am doing fine hope you are also doing fine
12/1/24, 11:45 AM - +265 984 00 71 30: <Media omitted>
12/1/24, 11:48 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the letter of recommendation Kelvin, it is well noted may I know what is your update regarding the JCE letter?
12/1/24, 11:52 AM - +265 984 00 71 30: About the JCE letter the school did not give that but l also pointed it out that the JCE is needed just as you said but the thing is due to the thing that JCE was not there by the time l was in form 2
12/1/24, 11:53 AM - +265 984 00 71 30: So l don’t know if it’s fine
12/1/24, 11:54 AM - +265 984 00 71 30: But if you still insist l can ask for it then from the school
12/1/24, 11:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that I understand that, however, a JCE reference letter is required since these documents are to submitted for your university application process.
12/1/24, 11:57 AM - +265 984 00 71 30: So the letter is it supposed to be like the results l got in form 2 for me to get to form 3?
12/1/24, 11:58 AM - Kirti Edoofa: @265984007130 Let me help you explain. The letter should state that by your time JCE was removed and you have passed the equivalent examination that was held in place of JCE. 

I hope we are clear?
12/1/24, 11:59 AM - +265 888 41 37 34: OK then let us request it from the School Administration to Asist us with that. Once we will be saved, we will save you too.
Thankds Madam Kirt,,,
12/1/24, 12:00 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: It’s clear
