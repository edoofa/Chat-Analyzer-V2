19/12/23, 8:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well. We were not able to have a meeting and have scheduled for Thursday, so I will be able to share the update by Thursday, please.
12/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sylvester, 

I hope this message finds you well. It has been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'* 

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
12/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to share a glimpse of the conference, and I hope you too are excited to attend such events when you come to India.

12/1/24, 6:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I understand that your A-level results didn't turn out as you had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.

It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
12/1/24, 6:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please know that you have our full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative paths, or just needing someone to talk to, we are here for you. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
12/1/24, 6:48 PM - +263 78 024 8736: Thank you so much Ms Kirti. I really appreciate the motivation.
12/1/24, 6:50 PM - +263 71 216 4410: Noted with thanks.
12/1/24, 6:51 PM - +263 78 024 8736: I'll be looking forward to hearing academic board suggestions
12/1/24, 9:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I would love to continue with our discussion, however, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow at 08:30 am to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
