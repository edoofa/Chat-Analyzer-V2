8/1/24, 1:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Can I anticipate that you will be able to complete the form by today at 04:00 pm, we have already delayed our sessions because you are not able to fill out the forms, your peers have already moved ahead of the forms and I do not want you to fall behind your peers. Because if we do not complete the process on time you will not only be behind your peers but at the same time you will not be able to start with your EWYL program so I would suggest you kindly be proactive in your admissions process now.
8/1/24, 1:05 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Okay thank you
8/1/24, 1:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, in the meantime may I know if you are available to connect with us so that we can continue with our discussion and you can share the update regarding the form by 04:00 pm today?
8/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Yes am available
8/1/24, 1:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
8/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Yes we can start
8/1/24, 1:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
8/1/24, 1:52 PM - +263 77 506 8620: I've gone through it
8/1/24, 2:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
8/1/24, 2:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
8/1/24, 2:09 PM - +263 77 506 8620: You've made it very clear
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
8/1/24, 2:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
8/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Yes I am
8/1/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
8/1/24, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
8/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Very clear indeed
8/1/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
8/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Yes we can start
8/1/24, 2:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
8/1/24, 2:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
8/1/24, 2:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
8/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Yes you can move forward
8/1/24, 2:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
8/1/24, 2:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

8/1/24, 2:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be

11/1/24, 12:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Celine,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you yesterday. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message and to confirm if we are still in communication?
11/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Good afternoon how are you
11/1/24, 12:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you were able to go through the audios by now?
11/1/24, 12:45 PM - +263 77 506 8620: For that l have a query ,l was having difficulties in hearing what was being said in the audios so can you please give me an insight if you can

11/1/24, 12:57 PM - +263 77 506 8620: I have understood that the Edoofa scholarship program is a life transforming opportunity whose goal and vision is to uplift capable students by helping them to build their dreams and turn them into reality by giving them a chance to study abroad
11/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 77 506 8620: It doesn't give one the chance to study in India only but also in other countries such as Canada ,the USA and China..Edoofa makes education expenses flexible through the EWYL program as one will be earning scholarship credits thereby reducing tertiary education costs
11/1/24, 1:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
11/1/24, 1:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/1/24, 1:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/1/24, 1:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/1/24, 1:17 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Okay thank you
11/1/24, 1:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
11/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 506 8620: Yes we are
11/1/24, 1:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
11/1/24, 1:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

12/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 77 506 8620: 2-The difference between duties and rights is rights are claims of an individual that are essential for the development of one's own self whilst a duty is something that someone is expected or required to do.A right is a power or claim possessed by an individual to do something whilst  a duty is an obligation to do or omit to do something.A right is an interest recognised by the state whilst a duty is an obligation created and imposed by the state
The difference between human and civil rights is that human rights belong to everyone everywhere regardless of nationality ,sexuality,race , religion or age whilst civil rights are those enjoyed by virtue of citizenship in a particular nation or state . human rights are considered universal to all human beings and in all countries whilst civil rights vary from country to country or government to government
