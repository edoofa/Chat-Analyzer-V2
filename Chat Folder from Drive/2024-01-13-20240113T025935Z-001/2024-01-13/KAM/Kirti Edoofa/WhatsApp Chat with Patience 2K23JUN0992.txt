21/12/23, 9:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Patience.

I trust you're all in good health. I wanted to reach out today, as the second deadline is drawing near. Hence I wanted to check on your preparations for this and to inquire about your plans, especially considering the upcoming festival season. Could you please let me know which date you have in mind to make the payment for the second deadline?
26/12/23, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience,

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $321 for your university registration fee is due before January 1, 2024. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations since you did not share an update with us previously when I inquired.

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $321 by now?
26/12/23, 3:40 PM - +263 71 642 4108: Hello, how are you? Payment will be done on time on or before the 1st of January 2024
26/12/23, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Thank you for the update. I have duly noted the information and will inform both the accounts team and the university officials accordingly. 

However, as we are currently in the festive season, there's a possibility that you might encounter unforeseen challenges at the bank. 

To be on the side of caution, we advise making the payment a day in advance. This precaution ensures you have a backup day, minimizing the risk of losing out on the entire opportunity. I trust you have taken note of our recommendation?
26/12/23, 3:49 PM - +263 71 642 4108: Noted thank you
28/12/23, 8:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Patience.

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out again to check on the status of the payment, as tomorrow is your deadline and you shared that you will be making the deposit on the 01st Jan however, the 01st Jan being the new year the banks might be closed. So I hope you take our recommendation and make the deposit a day before so that your deadline is not affected. It's important for us to provide an update to the university officials accordingly.

Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements?
4/1/24, 9:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you earlier, however, you did not respond, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
5/1/24, 10:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting today as I was occupied with a meeting. Given that the day has been quite lengthy for me and we're at the end of our working hours, I suggest we resume our discussion at 08:30 am tomorrow. I'm hopeful you'll be available at that time. Wishing you a wonderful evening, and I eagerly await our conversation tomorrow.

Thank you for sharing Patience's results, and congratulations on successfully clearing all your A-Level subjects! Your hard work over the past few months has truly paid off.

I'm sure your family is immensely proud of your achievements. Your A-level results have been duly noted, and we will promptly add them to your scholarship application.
