26/12/23, 1:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Wessly,

I trust you're well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. I completely understand that you must be occupied with work and thank you for letting me know that. However, as we are currently in the festive season, there's a possibility that you might encounter unforeseen challenges at the bank. 

To be on the side of caution, we advise making the payment a day in advance. This precaution ensures you have a backup day, minimizing the risk of losing out on the entire opportunity. I trust you have taken note of our recommendation?
