26/12/23, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Trish ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes I'm available now mam
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263777271107. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/12/23, 2:56 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes that fact about this Scholarship.
26/12/23, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/12/23, 3:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/12/23, 3:25 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes let  us proceed.
26/12/23, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/12/23, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/12/23, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Alright i understand let us move on
26/12/23, 3:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/12/23, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/12/23, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 3:58 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes i understand you explain it well
26/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
26/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 6:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263777271107 Are we still connected?
26/12/23, 9:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, As I was looking forward for your response, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 03:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
27/12/23, 6:53 AM - +263 77 727 1107: Good morning
27/12/23, 6:53 AM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes i understand.
27/12/23, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Trish, Wishing you a good day!
27/12/23, 3:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
27/12/23, 3:10 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes I'm available now
27/12/23, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us dear, Let's continue with the fourth benefit -
27/12/23, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/12/23, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/12/23, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/12/23, 9:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, I was looking forward for your response, I would love to connect with you to have a discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
28/12/23, 1:06 PM - +263 77 727 1107: No i understand well mam
28/12/23, 1:07 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Ok we will connect at 2:00pm
28/12/23, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Trish, 

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
28/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yea I'm available let us proceed
28/12/23, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
28/12/23, 2:17 PM - +263 77 727 1107: No I'm not aware of the process
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
28/12/23, 2:24 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes i understand and see the difference
28/12/23, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
28/12/23, 2:34 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes that's impossible
28/12/23, 2:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
28/12/23, 4:04 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes i agree
28/12/23, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
28/12/23, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
28/12/23, 4:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
28/12/23, 4:10 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes it's clear
28/12/23, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
28/12/23, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
28/12/23, 4:14 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes and i would like to ask how many years did it take to start with a diploma?
28/12/23, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, You can start the diploma soon after your results. Now, let us move forward to the last point,
28/12/23, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
28/12/23, 4:19 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Alright i get it
28/12/23, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/12/23, 4:49 PM - +263 77 727 1107: With what?
28/12/23, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, If you have any question which you would like to ask you can share it with us
28/12/23, 4:53 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Ok i do not have any question
28/12/23, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
28/12/23, 5:10 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes i'm so excited infact i can't even wait mam
28/12/23, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
28/12/23, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
28/12/23, 5:51 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Ok thank you so much
28/12/23, 5:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263777271107, Have a good day ahead!
30/12/23, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Trish ,

11/1/24, 8:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)

11/1/24, 8:43 PM - +263 77 727 1107: 1. Per annum tuition fee after the  Scholarship is $350.
2.$0
3.1600
4.250
5.$1000

I don't know if I'm correct
11/1/24, 8:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
11/1/24, 8:51 PM - +263 77 727 1107: It is so MVN is the name of the university i will be going or
11/1/24, 8:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263777271107  As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
11/1/24, 8:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
11/1/24, 8:56 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes i understand so how much I'm i supposed to pay to reserve  my Scholarship seat before 15 days from today
11/1/24, 8:57 PM - +263 77 727 1107: I'm i correct that 1850 will be reduced through my Earn While You Learn Projects
11/1/24, 8:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with us, please don't worry I will be assisting your regarding the same. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
11/1/24, 8:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
11/1/24, 9:01 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes I'm done
11/1/24, 9:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
11/1/24, 9:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
11/1/24, 9:06 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes it is clear
11/1/24, 9:06 PM - +263 77 727 1107: So for now how much I'm i supposed to pay?
11/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry dear, we have a payment plan for you which we will share with you soon. let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
11/1/24, 9:15 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes i really understand the advantage of EWYL project's
11/1/24, 9:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
11/1/24, 9:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
11/1/24, 9:18 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes ofcourse they are doing their work i hope i will be able to earn more credits
11/1/24, 9:19 PM - +263 77 727 1107: I don't understand this one may you please come again
11/1/24, 9:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263777271107 the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Giving you a balance of $850 for your university fees
11/1/24, 9:24 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Ok so i have to pay $850?
11/1/24, 9:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263777271107 You will be required to pay the balance of $850 before your arrival in India.
11/1/24, 9:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
11/1/24, 9:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
11/1/24, 9:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
11/1/24, 9:28 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes it makes sense
11/1/24, 9:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
11/1/24, 9:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
11/1/24, 9:32 PM - +263 77 727 1107: I would prefer $850 annually And how much will be the regestration fee for higher cost education?
11/1/24, 9:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850 . Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
11/1/24, 9:36 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes i understand
11/1/24, 9:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 23rd, 2024*.
11/1/24, 9:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
11/1/24, 9:40 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes explain further
11/1/24, 9:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 23rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 23rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
11/1/24, 9:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 23rd, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
11/1/24, 10:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263778216835 are we still connected ? <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 10:25 PM - +263 77 727 1107: I heard like you said we are going to pay $850
11/1/24, 10:26 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes
11/1/24, 10:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, The $850 will be needed before your arrival in India for your remaining tuition fees, I hope it's clear ?
11/1/24, 10:30 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes it's clear where I'm not understanding is there you said the total is $ 900
11/1/24, 10:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand the break up better. Your tution fees for the first year is $1850 and your registration fees is $1000 which will be adjusted in your first years fees which gives you a remaining balance of $850 that needs to be paid before your arrival. 

Now, When we come to $1000 you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. In simpler terms, The $100 will be paid by Edoofa for your registration fees which makes the registration amounts of $900 that needs to be paid by you.
11/1/24, 10:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you understand it now ?
11/1/24, 10:34 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Ok $100 will be paid by the programme and then my family will pay the remaining $850 right
11/1/24, 10:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, The registration amount is $1000 as you have a grant of $100 which means $1000 - $100 = $900 you need to pay this amount for your registration process.
11/1/24, 10:37 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Ok i get it now
11/1/24, 10:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
11/1/24, 10:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
11/1/24, 10:42 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes
11/1/24, 10:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
11/1/24, 10:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
11/1/24, 10:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)

11/1/24, 10:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
11/1/24, 10:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
11/1/24, 10:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's Eco Cash for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
11/1/24, 10:52 PM - +263 77 727 1107: Yes provide his details
11/1/24, 10:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -
