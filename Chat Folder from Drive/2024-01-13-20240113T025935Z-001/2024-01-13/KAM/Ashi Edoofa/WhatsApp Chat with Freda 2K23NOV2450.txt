19/12/23, 4:27 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: The process has been initiated. Had to give them documents and the offer letter as evidence of applying for the forex however the offer letter indicates Zimbabwe which is another hitch. We will keep on pushing but we also need a corrected version of the offer letter

19/12/23, 4:33 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: I believe what he is trying to say is when the offer letter is correct then the payment will start being processed as per bank instructions for valid documents <This message was edited>

21/12/23, 8:03 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: Please do. It's required. Good evening
21/12/23, 8:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @265999951305.  I will definitely shared the invoice with you tomorrow in the morning so that you can make the payment. Regarding the same for me to be able to request the invoice generated for you from the accounts team, please share the following details with me here:

1. Your (Freda's Parent's) Name:
2. Your (Freda's Parent's) Residential Address:

21/12/23, 8:37 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: Ben. Mbozi , Lilongwe, Malawi. The 650 one will do so that if fails we can do the other one. If you can do both the better as well
21/12/23, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265999951305 I am not able to understand the amount here please
21/12/23, 8:38 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of December 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $325, or you can opt to pay the full $650 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
21/12/23, 8:39 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: 👆👆
21/12/23, 8:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright so you are planning to make the complete payment, right?
21/12/23, 8:41 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: Can you do both invoices if possible. So we pay the one which I or the banks will allow depending also on the forex availability
21/12/23, 8:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @265999951305 In that case we will create two invoice of $325 each so that you have the option to make the payment accordingly. Is that okay?
21/12/23, 8:52 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: That will be good
21/12/23, 8:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @265999951305
21/12/23, 8:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I will do so please. Have a good night ahead!
26/12/23, 2:35 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Good afternoon everyone. I just wanted to ask for feedback on the offer letter
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Freda, Wishing you a good day!
26/12/23, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me check with the team please
26/12/23, 2:57 PM - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright thank you
28/12/23, 12:24 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: Good morning. I was trying to pay for the registration fee to the university unfortunately the bank says they do not know when they could remit the funds to your account due to forex issues. This being the deadline for registration what would be your advice
28/12/23, 12:24 PM - +265 999 95 13 05: They've only said they prioritise medical treatment and next is education. Unless you give a longer extension considering also that School will open in September 24, it will be difficult this end
28/12/23, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Freda, I hope you are doing well. 

I understand your concern here, Usually the amount takes around  2-4 days to be transferred here. Due to the forex challenge, The banks give priority to education fees, since your registration fees is for your Higher Education, The bank will definitely help you here. May I know if you have mentioned the same to the bank?
29/12/23, 8:56 AM - +265 999 95 13 05: Good morning. The issue here with my bankers is that they are putting a disclaimer if we happen to miss the deadline you put on the registration. The essence of my question is should we still proceed. All the documents are ready but we wait from you to grant an okay that the deadlines will be extended. Both the 28th December,2023 and 1st January,2024 one. There's a huge forex problem issue here and the demand is high as well. Your prompt and concise answer will be appreciated
29/12/23, 9:01 AM - +265 999 95 13 05: Unfortunately the bankers here cannot put a fixed date on when they remit the funds to your account but have said they will prioritize it as it's about education. There priorities are medical and education in that order
29/12/23, 10:53 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Freda, Wishing you all a good day!

Thank you for sharing your concern with us, I do understand the challenge you are facing due to the forex unavailability. With this in mind, May I kindly know by when you will be able to make the payment ?

This information will help me to request the extension for your registration fees from the officials, I am looking forward for your response.
29/12/23, 10:59 AM - +265 999 95 13 05: The problem is not me. I have funds( Malawi Kwachas) in my account but the bank cannot fix the actual date they will remit the forex into your account. May I suggest by end January to be on the safe side
29/12/23, 11:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Well Understood @265999951305, May I know if you can deposit the amount tomorrow so that I will share the updates with the university ?
29/12/23, 11:13 AM - +265 996 40 67 62: Sorry I don’t think you’re fully understanding our situation
29/12/23, 11:14 AM - +265 996 40 67 62: We can’t fully determine when they will deposit due to the forex problem
29/12/23, 11:14 AM - +265 996 40 67 62: May you advise us please on better approach maybe <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 11:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, Please I do understand the situation, I am saying that the earlier you pay the amount, then the bank will proceed accordingly. Hence, we have the higher chances to receive the amount earlier here. Therefore, I am advising you to pay the amount by tomorrow and once you make the transaction, we will inform the university accordingly so that they can reserve the scholarship seat for Freda. I hope you understand?
29/12/23, 11:52 AM - +265 994 06 51 06: This is understood and will proceed accordingly but have it reserved for 2 months atleast, till February end as the banks don't give dates to when payment will be done.
Thank you!
29/12/23, 12:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For the better understanding, Could you please let me know when are you going to make the deposit?
29/12/23, 12:07 PM - +265 999 95 13 02: Possibly this afternoon..
29/12/23, 12:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @265999951302, Please do let me know once you complete the transaction
29/12/23, 12:11 PM - +265 999 95 13 02: Ok, thank you.
