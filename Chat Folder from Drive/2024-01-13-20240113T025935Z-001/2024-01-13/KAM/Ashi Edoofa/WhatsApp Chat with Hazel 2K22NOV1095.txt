University Name: MVN University

Registration Fee Due: $1000
Endowment Grant: $150
Fee to be paid by the student/parent: $1000 - $150 = $850

Payment Mode Used: Mr. Rajan
International Transfer Charges: $60 (7% of the amount to be paid by the student/parent)

Total amount to be deposited including Charges: $850 + $60 = $910

Amount paid for the due registration fee: $775 (Paid on 28-Nov-2023, 30-Nov-2023, 02-Jan-2024, 05-Jan-2024)

Balance Amount Due: $910 - $775 = $135

As per the payment plan shared by the university, the remaining balance of $135 is to be paid to complete the registration process. It's worth noting that the earlier you make this payment, the sooner you'll be able to complete your university admission process. <This message was edited>
