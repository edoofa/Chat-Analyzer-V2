I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
10/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
10/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 78 354 5012: Yes, it's okay we can proceed
10/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
10/1/24, 2:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
10/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 77 139 8926: Hello. I ama tinashe's mother have just joined
10/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 77 139 8926: I can see on the offer letter  they are saying tinsshe did not submit hi A level results,  and rhey are waiting foe them yet we submitted  his result slip as Certificates are not yet our. May you assit on this one. If uou need us to resubmit  the result slip we do so as of now
10/1/24, 2:27 PM - +263 78 354 5012: 1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter? -$900
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?-3years (6 semesters)
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?-$300
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?-$750
10/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please ignore that instructions as we have submitted all the needed document for Tinashe.
10/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
10/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 354 5012: Yes it's clear
10/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 354 5012: I would like to ask if there is internship during the 3year course <This message was edited>
10/1/24, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263783545012 I will be assisting your query soon, Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
10/1/24, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
10/1/24, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
10/1/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 354 5012: I'm following
10/1/24, 2:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
10/1/24, 2:52 PM - +263 78 354 5012: Everything clear
10/1/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
10/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 78 354 5012: Yes, we can move on
10/1/24, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
10/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 23rd 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
10/1/24, 3:07 PM - +263 78 354 5012: Noted
10/1/24, 3:13 PM - +263 71 329 2452: Hello everyone, I'm Tinashe's father. I'm happy with good news.  I'm following the discussion, but I'm at work.
10/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 71 329 2452: Can you clarify on this, How much are we supposed to pay by 23 January 2024
10/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 139 8926: Following
10/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263713292452, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
10/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 77 139 8926: I think you just have to tell how.much is needed by 23 January . That's his question
10/1/24, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600  of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of January 23rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300  before the second deadline date of February 23rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
10/1/24, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *January 23rd, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
10/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 77 139 8926: Are we  done with the session.
10/1/24, 4:12 PM - +263 77 139 8926: My question is admission  , procedure fee and registration is totalling $1200, T
therefore by paying  a deposit of $750 it would mean one will be left with $450 to complete  the University fees then the cost of accommodation separately
10/1/24, 4:13 PM - +263 77 139 8926: OK very clear and understood now
10/1/24, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please go through this message dear, You are not required to pay $300
10/1/24, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You only have to pay the registration fees which is $600 with the help of Endowment benefits.
10/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 71 329 2452: Please help us by clarifying  the amount due by 23 January 2023.
10/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 77 139 8926: OK. I have understood  it now. If we are to go back tinashe's  question. He asked that during the 3 years period of his studies is he going to have an opportunity  to do an attachment/ internship while studying
10/1/24, 4:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263771398926, You will indeed have the opportunity to get an internship
10/1/24, 4:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, With the help of payment plan you need to pay $300 by 23rd January, 2024.
10/1/24, 4:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
10/1/24, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
10/1/24, 4:26 PM - +263 77 139 8926: Yes we  are in Harare
10/1/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
10/1/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
10/1/24, 4:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
10/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 139 8926: OK noted tank you
10/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 139 8926: Thank you
10/1/24, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
10/1/24, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
10/1/24, 4:54 PM - +263 77 139 8926: I think Mr Rajan option is the best.
10/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 139 8926: However  you may  as well share Mr Shoriwa's FBC account details  but I think Mr Rajan is the best
10/1/24, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
10/1/24, 5:33 PM - +263 78 354 5012: Noted @919650537098
10/1/24, 5:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
10/1/24, 5:38 PM - +263 78 354 5012: All clear
10/1/24, 5:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
10/1/24, 5:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
10/1/24, 5:57 PM - +263 77 139 8926: Once again thank  you. We will share with u the receipts once payment  has been  made
10/1/24, 6:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263771398926, With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
10/1/24, 7:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263771398926 @263783545012 Are we still connected ?
10/1/24, 10:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear, As I was looking forward for your response, I want to share that my working hours are over. Hence, I would like to schedule our session with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Please confirm if this time is convenient for you. In the event that you are unavailable at this specific time, kindly provide your availability between 2:00 PM and 7:00 PM, and we can coordinate to schedule our session accordingly.

Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?

11/1/24, 6:13 PM - +263 71 329 2452: Greetings,  everything is clear for now
11/1/24, 6:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
