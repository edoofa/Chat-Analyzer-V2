5/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263786535956. Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
5/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 653 5956: It's accurate but is it possible for one to change the programme
5/1/24, 2:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know why you want to change your course ?
5/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 653 5956: I have just developed some more interests in a certain programme which I wish to pursue
5/1/24, 2:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, Could you please share your interests with us ?
5/1/24, 2:17 PM - +263 78 653 5956: I would like to undertake BSc International relations and diplomacy
5/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: What motivates you to pursue B.Sc ?
5/1/24, 2:20 PM - +263 78 653 5956: At the moment the situation in Zimbabwe does not favour the side of lawyers
5/1/24, 2:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am not understanding your thoughts dear, as a lot of Zimbabwean students are pursuing BA LLB because they are inspired for the course.
5/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 653 5956: Considering individual circumstances I can pursue BSc International relations madam.I can not do what other people do..
For instance in the future I will be worrying
5/1/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry dear, We want the best option for you and will help you in choosing the right path. Although, It's my duty to help you understand the right information about your course. Hence, in order to understand your thoughts well. Please share why you don't want to pursue BA LLB? 

Additionally, Please share why you want to pursue B.Sc now?
5/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 653 5956: Since a lot of students are taking BA LlB it seems they will be stiff competition when it comes to employment whilst taking the same programm. 
What we need is employment after studying
5/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 78 653 5956: The reason why I want to pursue BSc is that I have one of my sister who took it here in Zimbabwe and is benefiting from the programme
5/1/24, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263786535956, Let's reconnect tomorrow in order to have a further discussion
5/1/24, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good day ahead!

10/1/24, 12:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have you explored about this course ?
10/1/24, 12:07 PM - +263 78 653 5956: Yes madam I have explored
10/1/24, 12:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Would like to share some insights with us ?
10/1/24, 12:11 PM - +263 78 653 5956: OK...last time when I searched about it I discovered that it is the study of internations organisations like in times of politics.non governmental organisations and trade
10/1/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand Rudolf, Have you explored the degree would be needed to pursue ?
10/1/24, 12:21 PM - +263 78 653 5956: Yes I have
10/1/24, 12:22 PM - +263 78 653 5956: The Degree is likely the same as social work ie some of the modules are under study to the  social work
10/1/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us dear, Although the course you are looking forward is applicable for Master's only which means you will first required to complete your bachelors.
10/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 78 653 5956: You are welcome madam
Which means I must first finish  bachelor's Degree then masters
10/1/24, 12:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, Let me also share that you can pursue the masters with the help of Edoofa Scholarship Program after you complete your Bachelors
10/1/24, 12:47 PM - +263 78 653 5956: It's OK thank you for sharing madam
10/1/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
10/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 78 653 5956: Yes it's accurate
10/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
10/1/24, 1:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
10/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
10/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
10/1/24, 1:48 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Well explained
10/1/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
10/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
10/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
10/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Well said however may l know how we can choose the best university when we are here . We have very little knowledge on rankings of universities
10/1/24, 2:00 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Since we talked about the registration fee with the counselor long back we need a revisit.
10/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, As I am here to help you choose the best university and I will always here for you.
10/1/24, 2:04 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Thank you
10/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me reiterate that the registration fees is needed in order to reserve your scholarship seat dear
10/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 77 956 6323: As you said it's part of fees am l correct there
10/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear, the registration fees is not an additional part as it's the part of your first year tuition fees.
10/1/24, 2:16 PM - +263 77 956 6323: So we are still waiting for the results
10/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No, dear. We will proceed with your application soon after we complete our today's session.
10/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
10/1/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Proceeding with out the results it's oky education policy differ here in Zimbabwe you apply using results
10/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Yes we are together
10/1/24, 2:32 PM - +263 77 956 6323: It was once said by the counselor in previous discussion s
10/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
10/1/24, 2:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
10/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 77 956 6323: My question is that the remaining amount how am l going to pay it
Is it in one installment or they will spread it according to simmesters
10/1/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you here dear, Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
10/1/24, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
10/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Well explained madam
10/1/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
10/1/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
10/1/24, 3:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
10/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 77 956 6323: May l have estimated amounts for visa and flight
10/1/24, 3:26 PM - +263 77 956 6323: The EWYL credits was discussed  however we were left behind the counselor told us that you will understand it as we move on  but he tried to explain it
10/1/24, 3:33 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Thank you for reminding us on expenses
10/1/24, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263779566323, Let me share the cost of Visa fees is $83 which will paid to Embassy and the flight tickets approximately cost between $400 - $500 based on the demand at the time of booking.
10/1/24, 3:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you are connected with your mentor ?
10/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 77 956 6323: No connected
10/1/24, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright Have you filled the EWYL form ?
10/1/24, 4:22 PM - +263 77 956 6323: I think so l can't remember we filled alot of forms in the beginning
10/1/24, 4:23 PM - +263 77 956 6323: What will they need to the Embassy as prove
10/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Or else you will assist us in every move after paying registration fee
10/1/24, 4:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263779566323 Please don't worry as we will help you in acquiring the Visa
10/1/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am sharing the EWYL form with you here, You need to fill the forms. In the form, you will find a section where you are required to specify the date on which you intend to commence your EWYL journey. The next batch is scheduled to start on Tuesday (16th January 2024).
10/1/24, 4:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Let me assure you that l will send it tomorrow  l need to print it out and right now it's late computer shops are losing
10/1/24, 4:37 PM - +263 77 956 6323: closing
10/1/24, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263779566323 Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 956 6323: You said this will depends on the university chosen it's it so
10/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 956 6323: You gave us an example  well explained
10/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 77 956 6323: May you pliz clarify on this issue
Last  year we were invited to meet founder of Edoofa  in the capital city but we didn't attend since ours was scheduled for this yr and we heard that those who attended where given full scholarship 
What about this year
10/1/24, 5:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263779566323 I didn't understand your query, please elaborate
10/1/24, 5:40 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Sorry wrong platform not for you
10/1/24, 5:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, May I know if there is any query ?
10/1/24, 5:52 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Everything is clear now
10/1/24, 5:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/1/24, 5:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
10/1/24, 5:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students.

11/1/24, 2:18 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Mid to end of the mouth

11/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Once you receive the results please make sure to share it with us
11/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/1/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
11/1/24, 2:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
11/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Let's proceed
11/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Benefit 1  you explained  and presented it clearly
11/1/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 77 956 6323: So you are saying this benefit number 2will assist if  fee structure is increased
11/1/24, 2:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263779566323
11/1/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Wonderful
11/1/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750 , this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650 .
11/1/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650 . Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750 . Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 77 956 6323: So this $100is paid after receiving the offer letter or before clarify that one
11/1/24, 3:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263779566323 this $100 is paid by the edoofa, the remaining amount will be paid by you when your offer letter arrives please
11/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 77 956 6323: It's now clear
11/1/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/1/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/1/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 30, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650 , you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before January 30, 2024. The remaining $325 should be paid by February 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 956 6323: That one is appreciated becoz here in Zimbabwe civil servants are not getting enough  but we want our children to get higher education
11/1/24, 3:29 PM - +263 77 956 6323: We are facing network challenges
11/1/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263779566323, That's why these benefits are important
11/1/24, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
11/1/24, 3:34 PM - +263 77 956 6323: I am not aware of the. process
11/1/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Quantum not familiar
11/1/24, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
11/1/24, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
11/1/24, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
11/1/24, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
11/1/24, 3:44 PM - +263 77 956 6323: When we stated the program they we saying you need to get 8 points and above however you explained it well
11/1/24, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have understood them! Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
11/1/24, 3:49 PM - +263 77 956 6323: That one it's impossible   we simply say you failed even here
11/1/24, 3:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
11/1/24, 3:50 PM - +263 77 956 6323: I agree
11/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
11/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
11/1/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/1/24, 3:56 PM - +263 77 956 6323: It's clear you seat will be reserved for 2025
11/1/24, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
11/1/24, 3:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 77 956 6323: So first complete a diploma using the same scholarship and then move to a B A
11/1/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
11/1/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
11/1/24, 4:45 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Sorry for late reply network problems
11/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Alright
11/1/24, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem @263779566323, Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 956 6323: So far so good
11/1/24, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263779566323 are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
11/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 956 6323: Very excited
11/1/24, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263779566323, Although I want to share that in order to proceed with your application we need the A level document. If you are able to find the statement of entry, it would be very beneficial for you
