27/12/23, 2:43 PM - +263 71 618 4916: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 71 618 4916: *Number 2* 
This course focus on ensuring students work as full-fledged lab techs capable of collecting samples such as blood tissues and other body fluids. These samples are used to conduct medical tests especially in the creating reports and discover diseases. These tests are to diagnose dignose diseases, monitor patient health and track of the effectiveness of treatment. Medical Laboratory technologists also play a role in research and development, working to develop new tests and improve the accuracy and efficiency to existing tests. These new technologies will have a significant impact on the health care system making possible to diagnose diseases earlier and provide effective treatment. Without laboratory technologists, doctors would not be able to diagnose diseases or provide effective treatment.
27/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 71 618 4916: *Number 3* 
The good laboratory practice ensures the safety and organization of pharmaceutical research. The practice is followed to maintain consistently high standard results. These include : Using measuring instruments that are likely to be more precise, accurate or reliable for example,measuring volumes with a graduated pipette rather than a syringe. Using techniques for measuring the dependent variable that are likely to be more reliable, for example using a colorimeter to measure colour changes rather than the naked eye. Using techniques or apparatus that are better able to keep standardized variables, such as using a thermostically controlled water bath than using a beaker. Also wearing proper clothing when conducting an experiment such as labcoat, googles, safety gloves. Also not carrying a lot of apparatus at the same time. These rules are such that :
there will be increased production of right first time results. Increased laboratory reputation. Increased overall productivity. Reduced need for re-work. Reduced time spent on non-revenue earning investigations.
27/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 71 618 4916: *Number 4* 
Different sterilization methods are :Auto claving, Dry heat (baking or flaming, filtration, radiation and using chemicals or solvents.

Filtration
-Sterilization by filtration (Also known as sterile filtration) is a cold method of sterilization that removes microbes instead of killing them. This method uses membranous filters with small pores to filter out the liquid so that all the bigger particles and microbes cannot pass. The three steps of filtration are sieving absorption and then trapping the residue
27/12/23, 2:47 PM - +263 71 618 4916: *Number 5*
The techniques used to place slide under a microscope are:

Dry mount
It is when a specimen is placed on a slide with or without a cover slip. This method is useful for viewing dry specimen such as hair or pollen.

Wet mount
Two or three drops of water. This will provides a contrast between two different components of the cells. Using forceps to support a cover slip with one edge resting near to the tissue at an angle of about45°. The cover slip is gently lowered over the tissue to be viewed. Excess water is removed. The slide is left for about 5 minutes. The slide is the placed on the microscope stage. It is then viewed.
27/12/23, 2:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you dear for sharing your response with us, May I know if you have completed the sop form?
27/12/23, 4:31 PM - +263 71 618 4916: May I kindly ask which one is the SOP Form
27/12/23, 4:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This one dear
27/12/23, 7:06 PM - +263 71 814 6495: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 7:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (29-Dec-2023).
27/12/23, 7:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
29/12/23, 9:29 AM - +263 71 618 4916: Good morning
29/12/23, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kunashe, Wishing you a good day!

In regards to our conversation yesterday, I would like to know if you are ready for today's discussion, I am looking forward to connect with you today. On the same note, Could you please share your response with us?
29/12/23, 5:10 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Good afternoon.
29/12/23, 5:11 PM - +263 71 618 4916: We are having challenges with internet connection
29/12/23, 5:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, May I know if we can continue now?
29/12/23, 6:25 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Yes
29/12/23, 6:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263716184916, Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/12/23, 6:29 PM - +263 71 618 4916: The information you have is correct
29/12/23, 6:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
29/12/23, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
29/12/23, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
29/12/23, 6:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/12/23, 6:33 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Yes it's true
29/12/23, 6:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
29/12/23, 6:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
29/12/23, 6:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
29/12/23, 6:36 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Yes it's true
29/12/23, 6:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
29/12/23, 6:38 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Yes very sure
29/12/23, 6:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
29/12/23, 6:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
29/12/23, 6:51 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Yes I understand
29/12/23, 7:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
29/12/23, 7:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
29/12/23, 9:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, I was waiting for your response although it seems like you were unavailable. I would love to continue with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
30/12/23, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kunashe, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to our yesterday conversation, I believe you had some challenges as you left the session in between, Hence, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
30/12/23, 7:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Kunashe,

As we approach the end of the year, I want to take a moment to reflect on all that we have accomplished together. Despite the challenges you faced, you persevered and continued to learn and grow. I am so proud of you for your hard work and dedication towards your Higher Education. 

As we look ahead to the new year, I want to wish you all a very happy and healthy 2024. May this year bring you joy, success, and fulfillment in all that you do. May you continue to learn and grow, and may you never lose your passion for knowledge and discovery.
30/12/23, 7:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, as you embark on new adventures please know that I am here to support you every step of the way. I would like to connect with you on Tuesday at 2:00 pm for the further discussion.  I look forward to continuing our journey together in the new year. Let us make 2024 a year of growth, learning, and discovery. 

Please confirm if this time is convenient for you. In the event that you are unavailable at this specific time, kindly provide your availability between 2:00 PM and 7:00 PM, and we can coordinate to schedule our session accordingly.
30/12/23, 7:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 7:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Wishing you all a Happy New Year. May it be filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities.
30/12/23, 9:17 PM - +263 71 618 4916: That you for this journey we travelled so far. Happy New Year.
30/12/23, 9:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome @263716184916
2/1/24, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kunashe,

I hope this message finds you well. In regards to my previous messages, I wanted to share that I am looking forward for our discussion today regarding your admission journey. I am here at the scheduled time and am looking forward to our conversation. Please let me know if you are available for the discussion.

I am genuinely excited and eagerly awaiting your response.
3/1/24, 2:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kunashe , I hope you are doing well. 

As I was waiting for your response, however as you have not share any response with us. I understand that you might be occupied with other thing, so I wanted to know if you are available for the discussion today, Could you please share your response with us?
3/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Good afternoon. We are available.
3/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 71 814 6495: Good afternoon
3/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263716184916, May I know if you have taken a note of my above message?
3/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Yes I got the message correctly
3/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
3/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
3/1/24, 2:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
3/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Noted
3/1/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
3/1/24, 2:46 PM - +263 71 618 4916: I got all the information correctly
3/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
3/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
3/1/24, 2:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
3/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
3/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Yes very true
3/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
3/1/24, 3:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
3/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Thank you for the information
3/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
3/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
3/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
3/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
3/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Noted
3/1/24, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
3/1/24, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
3/1/24, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
3/1/24, 3:31 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Okay. That's great news indeed
3/1/24, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
3/1/24, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
3/1/24, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
3/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Yes well explained
3/1/24, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
3/1/24, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
3/1/24, 4:18 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Yes indeed
3/1/24, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
3/1/24, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
3/1/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 30, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before January 30, 2024. The remaining $325 should be paid by February 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
3/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 71 618 4916: I am following properly
3/1/24, 4:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
3/1/24, 5:01 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Provide me with more information
3/1/24, 5:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
3/1/24, 5:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
3/1/24, 5:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
3/1/24, 5:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
3/1/24, 5:13 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Noted
3/1/24, 5:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
3/1/24, 5:25 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Correct
3/1/24, 6:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)* <This message was edited>
3/1/24, 6:44 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Ok. Got it
3/1/24, 6:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
3/1/24, 6:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
3/1/24, 6:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
3/1/24, 8:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, As I am waiting for your response, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
3/1/24, 8:34 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Yes it's clear. Have a good day.
4/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kunashe, I hope you are doing well.
4/1/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With respect to your admission journey, I would like to connect with you today and move ahead with your journey. Could you please share your response with us ?
4/1/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Good afternoon.
4/1/24, 2:33 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Everything which was explained yesterday was well understood
4/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Let's continue with the session.
4/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
4/1/24, 2:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
4/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Yes very clear
4/1/24, 2:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
4/1/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
4/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Very well understood
4/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
4/1/24, 3:25 PM - +263 71 618 4916: No queries so far
4/1/24, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
4/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 71 618 4916: Very excited
4/1/24, 3:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
