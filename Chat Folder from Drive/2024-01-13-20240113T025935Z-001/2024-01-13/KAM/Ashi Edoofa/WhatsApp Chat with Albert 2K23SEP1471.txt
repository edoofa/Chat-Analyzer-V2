19/12/23, 9:53 AM - You joined using this group's invite link
26/12/23, 7:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Albert, How are you doing?
26/12/23, 7:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine, thank you for asking @263773692593
26/12/23, 9:13 AM - +263 77 369 2593: Morng hw are u
26/12/23, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine @263773692593, May I know when you will be available for the discussion please?
26/12/23, 4:06 PM - +263 77 369 2593: I am ready nw
26/12/23, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Let's continue with the second benefit of endowment plan -
26/12/23, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/12/23, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/12/23, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 4:20 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Well noted # @ student
26/12/23, 4:20 PM - +263 77 369 2593: Thanx so much noted
26/12/23, 4:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750 , this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650
26/12/23, 4:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650 . Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750 . Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/12/23, 4:38 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Yes
26/12/23, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/12/23, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/12/23, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/12/23, 4:49 PM - +263 78 585 4209: So far so good
26/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/12/23, 4:58 PM - +263 78 585 4209: a little bit clarity here please
26/12/23, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/12/23, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/12/23, 8:00 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Ok ok I already have my A level results
26/12/23, 8:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263785854209
26/12/23, 8:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 8:05 PM - +263 78 585 4209: I don't have any so far
26/12/23, 8:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 8:16 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Greatly excited!!! Yes we can
26/12/23, 8:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/12/23, 8:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

11/1/24, 8:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
11/1/24, 8:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
11/1/24, 8:18 PM - +263 78 585 4209: 1. 0
2. 0
3. 1250
4. 125
5. 1000
11/1/24, 8:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
11/1/24, 8:33 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Okey I understand...soo  according to this letter , it means that a total annual fee of 1250 will be paid for things like ( examination fee ,admin and the likes??
11/1/24, 8:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you here @263785854209, As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
11/1/24, 8:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
11/1/24, 8:41 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Okey I understand
11/1/24, 8:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
11/1/24, 8:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
11/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Yeah that was going to be my next question.  Soo how about the issue of scholarship credits?
11/1/24, 8:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
11/1/24, 8:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
11/1/24, 8:51 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Oooky . Soo this can to reduce this total annual fee of $1500 right?
11/1/24, 8:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263785854209, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1500. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1500 - $1000 = $500, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EW
11/1/24, 9:13 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Soo this $1000 registration fee will be deducted from the total anual fee of $1250 or?
11/1/24, 9:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263785854209, It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
11/1/24, 9:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $500for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
11/1/24, 9:24 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Okey I'm getting you now
11/1/24, 9:27 PM - +263 78 585 4209: But why they have asked this $1000 to be paid on a one time basis ?😁. Kk no negotiations?
11/1/24, 9:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263785854209 I will be assiting your regarding the $1000 soon. Before,  I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750
11/1/24, 9:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
11/1/24, 9:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
11/1/24, 9:38 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Yes. Its now clear
11/1/24, 9:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
11/1/24, 9:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
11/1/24, 10:05 PM - +263 78 585 4209: I would prefer a higher registration fee with a lower anual cost of education because this registration fee is paid is paid once right?? if I'm not mistaken
11/1/24, 10:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are absolutely correct. Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1500 . Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
11/1/24, 10:13 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Yes
11/1/24, 10:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 23rd, 2024*.
11/1/24, 10:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
11/1/24, 10:17 PM - +263 78 585 4209: I hope my parents will go through this discussion we had  and share theirs thoughts later. @263773692593 . Now they are offline
11/1/24, 10:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem dear, I will be more than happy to listen their thoughts. In the meantime, Kindly share your response for the above message.
11/1/24, 10:20 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Yes please explain
11/1/24, 10:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 19th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
11/1/24, 10:22 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Well noted
11/1/24, 10:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 19th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
11/1/24, 10:24 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Well.noted and clear
11/1/24, 10:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
11/1/24, 10:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
11/1/24, 10:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263785854209 Are we still connected ?
11/1/24, 10:49 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Yes we stay in Harare
11/1/24, 10:49 PM - +263 78 585 4209: Yes
11/1/24, 10:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
11/1/24, 10:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
11/1/24, 10:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
11/1/24, 10:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please do let me know once you have taken a note of Mr. Rajan contact number.
11/1/24, 11:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263785854209 As I was waiting for your response, I would like to share that my available hours are over hence we will connect tomorrow at 2:00 pm. If this timing is not convenient for you please do let me know the availability of yours between 01:00 pm to 8:00 pm
11/1/24, 11:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a good night ahead!
12/1/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Albert, Wishing you a good day!
