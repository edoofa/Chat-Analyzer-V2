12/1/24, 5:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear, Thank you for sharing your results with us!
12/1/24, 5:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that your A-level results didn't turn out as you had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.

It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
12/1/24, 5:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please know that you have our full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative paths, or just needing someone to talk to, we are here for you. We have taken a note of your results and shall update the admissions team about the same.
