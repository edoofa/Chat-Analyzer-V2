12/1/24, 6:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu,

I hope this message finds you well. I am Ms. Ashi. It has been a while since we last connected, and I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'* 

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career. <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.


We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.
12/1/24, 6:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to share a glimpse of the conference, and I hope you too are excited to attend such events when you come to India.

This is a time to celebrate your achievements and reflect on the journey that led you here. We appreciate your efforts and shall update the admissions team about your results. Best of luck in all your future endeavors!
12/1/24, 9:00 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Oky thank you
12/1/24, 9:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear,
12/1/24, 9:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I trust you remember our last conversation on 6th of November, where we discussed the formalities the admission team was handling for your university admission. To ensure we are on the same page, let me recap what the team has been working on since then.

Following our last session, we submitted your application to multiple universities for scholarship consideration. However, as some time had passed without receiving any updates from the university officials, I personally took the initiative to inquire about the status of your application, which was submitted on 10th of November.
12/1/24, 9:03 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Oky any luck?
12/1/24, 9:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Upon requesting an update from the university officials, we learned that the eligibility criteria for the *B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering)* course had been revised in accordance with government guidelines for the August 2024 academic intake. While your documents were evaluated, the universities found you eligible for the scholarship. However, due to changes in government guidelines, you were not ineligible for the course B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering)
12/1/24, 9:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: According to the updated eligibility criteria, students need to have studied Chemistry in their A-levels to pursue the  B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering). Unfortunately, as you did not have the required subject, they indicated that you are currently ineligible for the program.
12/1/24, 9:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Since these updates, the team has been actively working to find a solution for you. We engaged in detailed discussions with the university officials to address this situation. As a team, our goal has been to ensure that you can pursue a course aligned with your career interests. 

With the grace of God, we were able to find a solution, and we would like to share the highlights of our discussion and the solutions we have explored for you. If we are together, shall I share the same solution with you?
12/1/24, 9:10 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Yes please share
12/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After engaging in discussions with university officials and the academic board, we are pleased to inform you that we have identified a solution that not only allows you to pursue your desired course but also emphasizes the significance of selecting the right career path.
12/1/24, 9:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The university officials highlighted that the foundational subjects for all engineering courses are the same in the first year of education. Recognizing the importance of helping you bridge the gap created by your initial subject combination, they assessed your eligibility for the course B.Tech (Computer Science Engineering), which is highly sought-after in the 21st century.
12/1/24, 9:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As a result, you will embark on the journey of pursuing B.Tech Computer Science Engineering in your first year. If, in the second year, you decide to revert to your original course, you can do so by changing your major. Alternatively, should you discover a growing interest in Computer Science Engineering, you can seamlessly continue in that field.
12/1/24, 9:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We believe that this solution aligns with your career goals and will enable you to stay on track effectively. We wanted to share this update with you and are eager to hear your thoughts on this matter?
12/1/24, 9:36 PM - +263 78 125 6089: That will work l guess
12/1/24, 9:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263781256089, May I know if we can apply your application for  B.Tech Computer Science Engineering  ?
12/1/24, 10:02 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Yes
12/1/24, 10:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, we will move ahead with your application accordingly
12/1/24, 10:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Have a blessed night ahead!
12/1/24, 10:42 PM - +263 78 125 6089: Same to you
