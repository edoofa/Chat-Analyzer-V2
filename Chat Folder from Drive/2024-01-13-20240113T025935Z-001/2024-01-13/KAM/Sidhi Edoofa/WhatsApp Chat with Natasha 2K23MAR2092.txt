6/1/24, 4:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.

I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

8/1/24, 5:10 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind wishes. I am happy to be here to support her in realising her dreams and succeed in life.
8/1/24, 5:11 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I would like to discuss about your daughter's admission process. As per her application file, it seems that she were unable to proceed with her admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you and her to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 71 243 1513: She was focusing more on her examinations but it's done and let's proceed with the admission process whilst we are waiting for her results so that we meet our 2024 August enrollment.
9/1/24, 8:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely understandable. Working hard and concentrating on examinations is very important, and it is good to hear that she was focused on it to perform her best during examinations.

It is great to know that you are now available to take your admission process forward.

I would like to schedule a detailed conversation regarding the same today. Would you be available at 2:30 PM today?

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/1/24, 8:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
10/1/24, 8:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
10/1/24, 8:17 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 8:21 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Great thank you
10/1/24, 8:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
10/1/24, 8:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
10/1/24, 8:33 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
10/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Great job you are doing assist our children to achieve their dreams. Well done.
10/1/24, 8:48 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Keep up the good work
10/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you, dear. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
10/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
10/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
10/1/24, 8:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/1/24, 8:59 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Reviewed let's proceed thank you
10/1/24, 9:00 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Good flexible developments
10/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
10/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.
10/1/24, 9:01 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
10/1/24, 9:08 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the above messages?
10/1/24, 9:10 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Yes
10/1/24, 9:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad.
10/1/24, 9:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/1/24, 9:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/1/24, 9:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/1/24, 9:22 AM - +263 71 243 1513: That is great, keeping the  fees at the same level from last year and during the whole period upto completion of her bachelor's education. Well done by keeping the fees affordable and flexible.
10/1/24, 9:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes indeed, Natasha.
10/1/24, 9:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
10/1/24, 9:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Yes very resonate , thank you.
10/1/24, 9:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/1/24, 9:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/1/24, 9:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/1/24, 9:35 AM - +263 71 243 1513: May l get deadline of end of February onwards because January l am not ready financially.
10/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I have taken a note of your query, dear. However, once I have explained the benefits of the endowment program, which will help you financially, we can discuss your query in detail and find a solution for it. So, shall we move ahead?
10/1/24, 9:41 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Yes thank you
10/1/24, 9:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well, dear.
10/1/24, 9:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/1/24, 9:49 AM - +263 71 243 1513: So far before the A level are out the assessment is based on O level results and A level entry examination slip , when the results are out ,if you meet the pass standard. You will be enrolled at the university, if you don't  meet the required passes , you will be enrolled for a diploma then proceed later.
10/1/24, 9:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is very correct, Natasha. I am glad that you have such clarity.
10/1/24, 9:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/1/24, 10:00 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Thank well explained.
10/1/24, 10:11 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
10/1/24, 10:13 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Noted it's fully understood
10/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/1/24, 10:19 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/1/24, 10:29 AM - +263 78 648 1446: Yes it's clear
10/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
10/1/24, 10:42 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/1/24, 10:45 AM - +263 71 243 1513: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 11:21 AM - +263 71 243 1513: Clear thank you
10/1/24, 12:12 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Clear thank you
10/1/24, 1:38 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 243 1513: So far, it's clear. May we have a timetable for these sessions. Thank you.
10/1/24, 2:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 2:21 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Sorry who is Abigail?
10/1/24, 2:33 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I apologize for the confusion dear.
10/1/24, 2:34 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Ok
10/1/24, 2:35 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, we have come to a conclusion to our conversation. We have completed your process, and we will move forward with sending out your application to different universities and start your process so you can get the best education here in India. Are you excited for the same?
10/1/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 648 1446: Yes i am  excited for the next step
10/1/24, 2:40 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 71 243 1513: Is the medical fees going to be included?
11/1/24, 8:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good morning, dear. I hope your day is going well.

While the university provides various facilities, medical expenses are not covered under their purview. To protect international students from these expenses, there is *Medical Health Insurance*.

A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from India or Zimbabwe, it would cost them around $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
