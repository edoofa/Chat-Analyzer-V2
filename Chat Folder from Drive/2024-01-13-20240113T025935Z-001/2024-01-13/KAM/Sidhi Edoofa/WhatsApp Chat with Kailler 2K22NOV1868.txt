I firmly believe that with the commencement of this new year, comes the promise of fresh beginnings, guiding the way for the actualization of one's deepest dreams and aspirations. As we stand on the threshold of this promising year, I am filled with excitement for the adventures it holds.
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the same spirit, I would like to share that I am embarking on a journey as I prepare myself to pursue my doctorate and take a step forward in my academic pursuits. This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Ms. Siddhi,* who will connect with you on Tuesday.  I hope you will make yourself available for further procedures and will give your best to your career.
6/1/24, 1:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments. Wish you all the best, and God Bless.

Regards,
Mr. Shiveet
Edoofa Admission Team.
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Good afternoon , okay well noted, thank you for everything you have done for us as a family
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kailler,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:58 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 5:03 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Good afternoon okay well noted thank you
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for your response.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 5:57 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Im looking forward to start my university , new environment, meet new people and have new experience
9/1/24, 9:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am so glad to hear that. Absolutely, meeting new people in a new environment and having new experiences bring about learning, and with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success. I am looking forward to you exploring all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
9/1/24, 9:02 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
9/1/24, 9:08 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Good morning , so I wrote my Alevel last year and looking forward for the results this month of January so I'm still waiting for the offer letters because haven't received any as of yet so I think I'm just waiting for them and I'm already waiting to move forward and since we need time to prepare for alot of things to start my university level I'm just hoping I receive the offer letters qs soon as possible , move to the next stage and finish this admission processes with visa processing and start preparing for my new chapter of life
9/1/24, 9:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand Kailler, thank you for sharing that information with me.

That is good to hear that you are now available to take the process forward in order to ensure that you secure a scholarship seat in the best university for your higher education. I believe there must have been some misunderstanding that caused your application process to not move ahead. However, I am relieved that we are connected now in order to take it forward.

According to my records, we have completed 3 out of 6 steps for your admission process, i.e., up until Statement of Purpose and Counselling Session on University Admission. Am I correct?
9/1/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes that's is correct
9/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes and was told was going to receive an offer letters if not mistaken last week and still waiting
9/1/24, 9:54 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that dear. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 9:58 AM - +263 78 010 5235: So basically everything have been well explained to me and I'm aware of it , the only thing that is stressing me out is that the person who will be paying part of my fees which is not covered by the scholarship wants to know at the beginning of the season the total amount that will be , and the admission fee I have to pay , and the amount for the visa so as to budget accordingly since it's this year I have to be there in India and they are sponsoring alot of students so need to know the total amount of costs so as to budget effectively
9/1/24, 10:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, dear. Please do not worry. I believe Mr. Shivjeet had explained to you that the cost of your higher education will range from $2000 to $3000, am I correct?
9/1/24, 10:25 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I'm aware of that
9/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
9/1/24, 10:49 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
9/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I'm aware of this
9/1/24, 10:50 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: So, I suggest that you budget your finances accordingly, as the final fee-breakdown can only be handed over to you after the University sends out your Offer Letter. Are you following?
9/1/24, 10:50 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I am
9/1/24, 10:52 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In order to reach that stage, we need to first move ahead with your application process. First, I would like to ask you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
9/1/24, 10:53 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay but I did sent these documents though
9/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 010 5235: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 010 5235: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 010 5235: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 10:54 AM - +263 78 010 5235: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 11:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that information with me. I believe there must have been a misunderstanding. Please be rest assured that your documents have been duly noted by me. 

Do you wish to move forward with the application process now?
9/1/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes please
9/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Very well. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
9/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
9/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
9/1/24, 1:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you really looking forward to this offer letters and continue with my journey
9/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 010 5235: And be in this picture this year
9/1/24, 2:47 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Kailler. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
9/1/24, 2:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
9/1/24, 2:48 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
9/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you, really looking forward to get through
9/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad, Kailler. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
9/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
9/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
9/1/24, 2:53 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
9/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I have reviewed them and we Did discussed about them one by one
9/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I believe you are confusing the fee-breakup discussion with the Endowment Program discussion. Let me help you understand the difference better.  Let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
9/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
9/1/24, 2:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
9/1/24, 3:00 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky noted
9/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay that's good well noted
9/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
9/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
9/1/24, 3:17 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Oky thank you and we'll noted
9/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
9/1/24, 3:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
9/1/24, 3:23 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes everything is clear
9/1/24, 3:23 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
9/1/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
9/1/24, 3:24 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
9/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I'm following every detail
9/1/24, 3:27 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 78 010 5235: I think you can help me out
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
9/1/24, 3:28 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
9/1/24, 3:30 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes all clear now thank you
9/1/24, 3:39 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
9/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes that is true
9/1/24, 4:59 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
9/1/24, 5:00 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes that I clear
9/1/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
9/1/24, 5:09 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
9/1/24, 5:10 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank is fine
9/1/24, 5:13 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
9/1/24, 5:14 PM - +263 78 010 5235: This is a good offer
9/1/24, 5:14 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
9/1/24, 5:14 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Yes I'm
9/1/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
9/1/24, 5:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
9/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay well noted
9/1/24, 5:20 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
9/1/24, 5:20 PM - +263 78 010 5235: No everything is clear
9/1/24, 5:22 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Alright, with this, we can conclude our conversation today. Are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 69 students have already secured their seats, leaving 31 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Abigail is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
9/1/24, 5:22 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Thank you, yes I am
9/1/24, 5:26 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
9/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 78 010 5235: Okay thank you
10/1/24, 11:18 AM - +263 78 010 5235: Good morning

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
12/1/24, 4:45 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 9:00 AM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
12/1/24, 4:46 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
