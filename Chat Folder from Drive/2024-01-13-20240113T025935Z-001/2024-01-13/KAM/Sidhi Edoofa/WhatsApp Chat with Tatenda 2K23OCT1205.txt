27/12/23, 1:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tatenda!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. It has been a while since the last time we were connected. I was occupied with the holidays. Please, how are you doing today and how was your holiday?
27/12/23, 1:05 PM - +263 77 643 4112: I am doing well . Thank you for reaching out.
27/12/23, 1:05 PM - +263 77 643 4112: My holiday was fine l did have a good experience
27/12/23, 1:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
27/12/23, 1:12 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Its oky we can proceed
27/12/23, 1:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/12/23, 1:16 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l do agree
27/12/23, 1:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/12/23, 1:17 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/12/23, 1:21 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you l really understand  and feel  comforted
27/12/23, 1:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
27/12/23, 1:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 77 643 4112: So after getting a deploma you can also be able to continue to bachelors degree with edoofa as well
27/12/23, 1:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
27/12/23, 1:25 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you now l understad
27/12/23, 1:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/12/23, 1:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 1:29 PM - +263 77 643 4112: I didnt get interms of certificates of various job-oroented projects
27/12/23, 1:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the concern with me. These are related to your EWYL projects and your session. For further detail, you can connect with your mentor. May I know if you are clear now?
27/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yaa am clear now thank you
27/12/23, 1:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
27/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l am please leats proceed
27/12/23, 1:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
27/12/23, 1:58 PM - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you very much
