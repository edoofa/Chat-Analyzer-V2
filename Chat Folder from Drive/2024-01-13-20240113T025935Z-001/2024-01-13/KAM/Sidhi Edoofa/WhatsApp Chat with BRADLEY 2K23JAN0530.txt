This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

8/1/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bradley,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:05 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
9/1/24, 9:37 PM - +263 78 906 8027: Sorry l have sent my phone  for repairs it got damaged
10/1/24, 7:56 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is alright, dear. How are you today?
10/1/24, 7:56 AM - +263 78 906 8027: I am doing good
10/1/24, 7:57 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practise more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
10/1/24, 7:57 AM - +263 78 906 8027: And how are you also doing
10/1/24, 7:59 AM - +263 78 906 8027: I have truly decided that l should spend the rest of my life in India
10/1/24, 8:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am doing well, dear. Thank you for asking.
10/1/24, 8:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: It is great to hear that, Bradley. Now, are you ready to move forward with this discussion about your application process?
10/1/24, 9:04 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Yes
10/1/24, 9:06 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad. Before we move forward, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
10/1/24, 9:25 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Ok
10/1/24, 9:27 AM - +263 78 906 8027: They are stored and locked by my mom is it ok if l get them when she comes back from work
10/1/24, 9:28 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: That is completely alright. Kindly update me regarding the same once she is back from work. In the meanwhile, we can proceed with discussing your application. So, shall we move ahead?
10/1/24, 9:31 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Ok
10/1/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/1/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
10/1/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
10/1/24, 9:32 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 78 906 8027: How many universities did l get
10/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Thank you very much
10/1/24, 9:35 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The process is not yet complete, dear. We will need the above mentioned documents in order to send your application to universities. By the end of the day, once we have concluded our conversation and received your documents, we will go ahead and send out your application to the universities. I hope I am clear?
10/1/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
10/1/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
10/1/24, 9:36 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.*
10/1/24, 9:37 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Thank you for your support
10/1/24, 9:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
10/1/24, 9:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.

10/1/24, 9:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This message was deleted
10/1/24, 9:37 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
10/1/24, 9:38 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Ok
10/1/24, 9:38 AM - +263 78 906 8027: I did
10/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
10/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
10/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.
10/1/24, 9:41 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
10/1/24, 9:45 AM - +263 78 906 8027: That’s really great l see
10/1/24, 9:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/1/24, 9:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/1/24, 9:46 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Yah
10/1/24, 9:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
10/1/24, 9:47 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/1/24, 9:49 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Yes l see
10/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/1/24, 9:51 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/1/24, 10:09 AM - +263 78 906 8027: I understand
10/1/24, 10:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/1/24, 10:37 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Yes
10/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/1/24, 10:39 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/1/24, 10:48 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Ok
10/1/24, 10:49 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Can they increase my scholarship percentage if l pass with flying colors
10/1/24, 11:10 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Yes, that is a possibility. The university will reevaluate your application and get back to you in case there are any changes in your scholarship percentage. I hope that is clear?
10/1/24, 11:13 AM - +263 78 906 8027: Yes
10/1/24, 11:23 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am glad.
10/1/24, 11:24 AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
