29/12/23, 4:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Shyleen

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - +263 71 554 0651: We're fine thanks and how are you doing.
29/12/23, 4:23 PM - +263 78 909 8049: we are fine, how about you
29/12/23, 4:41 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great too, thank you for asking. If you are ready shall we now proceed with the session with the admission porcess?
29/12/23, 5:31 PM - +263 71 554 0651: Yes please
29/12/23, 5:32 PM - +263 77 336 8037: We are blessed thank you and how are you doing
29/12/23, 5:32 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Yes we can proceed
29/12/23, 6:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
29/12/23, 6:03 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Yes we do
29/12/23, 6:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/12/23, 6:08 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Yes sir ,but I want to know if we still continue deposing on the same account number or?
29/12/23, 6:21 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We can also share you with multiple account options for that. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/12/23, 6:24 PM - +263 77 336 8037: I'm Shyleen' s mom sir I'm the one asking we have already discussed and since it's end of the month I wanted to know if we can continue depositing on that account number that we have

29/12/23, 6:40 PM - +263 77 336 8037: Okay thanks we will continue with the one that we have thank you🙏
29/12/23, 6:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's perfectly fine. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on 2nd of January to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.

9/1/24, 9:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career.

9/1/24, 9:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?

However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:09 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].
