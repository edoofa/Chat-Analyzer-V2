29/12/23, 4:37 PM - +263 78 236 0276: For the  admission processs lasted on monthly subscription to payed monthly for 10 months with a figure of $150 usd
29/12/23, 4:41 PM - +263 78 236 0276: Understood
29/12/23, 4:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
29/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 78 236 0276: Let's schedule for the January second
29/12/23, 4:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, that can be done.

I will be guiding you toward realizing your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 9:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:37 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

12/1/24, 10:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am doing good as well and thank you so much for asking. I am glad to know that you had a great start to the year and I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263782360162 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?
12/1/24, 10:57 AM - +263 78 027 1859: Well as for me i have vowed to take my school work seriously this year as its the final year at high school , I also wanna have a positive perspective about everything in life to become a better person tomorrow so that i may achieve my goals 😊

12/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that. Thank you for sharing your aspirations and aspects that you need to work on. I truly appreciate the honesty.
12/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving towards the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 3:59 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
