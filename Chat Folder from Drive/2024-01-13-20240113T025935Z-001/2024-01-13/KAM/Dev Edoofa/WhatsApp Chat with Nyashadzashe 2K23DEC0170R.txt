It used for Genetic therapy.
Biotechnology produces biomakers which are used for environmental monitoring.
4/1/24, 3:59 PM - +263 78 810 0185: 3) What is rDNA technology
Recombinant DNA technology comprises altering genetic material outside an organism to obtain enhanced and desired characteristics in living organisms or as their products. This technology involves the insertion of DNA fragments from a variety of sources, having a desirable gene sequence via appropriate vector . Manipulation in organism's genome is carried out either through the introduction of one or several new genes and regulatory elements or by decreasing or blocking the expression of endogenous genes through recombining genes and elements. Enzymatic cleavage is applied to obtain different DNA fragments using restriction endo-nucleases for specific target sequence DNA sites followed by DNA ligase activity to join the fragments to fix the desired gene in vector. The vector is then introduced into a host organism, which is grown to produce multiple copies of the incorporated DNA fragment in culture, and finally clones containing a relevant DNA fragment are selected and harvested. Different types of vectors are used which includes retroviruses, fosmids, cosmids, yeast artificial chromosomes. These vectors are delivered into organism using transformation, electroporation, conjugation and transduction. It has it's applications in agriculture, medicine, environment and food industry.
4/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 78 810 0185: 4) What is monoclonal antibody technology.
Monoclonal antibody, are antibodies produced artificially through genetic engineering and related techniques such as Hybridoma technology. When activated by an antigen, a circulating B cell multiplies to form a clone of plasma cells, each secreting identical immunoglobulin molecules. It is such immunoglobulins—derived from the descendants of a single B cell—that are called monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibody technology (Hybridoma Technology) follows a series of steps to produce antibodies as follows.
Immunization of mice to stimulate immune response and activate differentiation of B Cells into memory B cells and Plasma B cells.
Isolation of B lymphocytes using density gradient centrifugation.
Fusion of activated B lymphocytes with myeloma cells to create hybridomas.
Selection of Hynridoma cells through culturing the cells for 10 to 14 days. The cells with active HCPRT genes survive and they are selected.
Cloning and propagation follows.
Harvesting is done.
There are different monoclonal antibodies produced such as PD-L1, Nivolumab.
The technology is used to develop antibodies used in treatment and diagnostic of cancers, hematology, inflammatory diseases.
4/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 78 810 0185: 5)
4/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 78 810 0185: What do you mean by antisense technology.
Antisense DNA technology is a method used to inhibit or downregulate the synthesis a target protein by using antisense DNA or RNA molecules. An antisense sequence is a DNA or RNA that is perfectly complementary to the target nucleotide sequence present in the cell. There are two possible mechanisms for an antisense effect. The method that relies on targeting of the mRNA is called the antisense strategy. When the double-stranded DNA or genes situated in the nucleus are targeted, the approach is called the antigene strategy. Whereas the antisense strategy is well established with several examples of in vitro and in vivo applications, the antigene approach have limited knowledge. The antisense strategy utilizes the ability of a 100% complementary DNA or RNA sequence to interlock or hybridize with the target mRNA thus inhibiting the translation of the target protein. This inhibition can be achieved either by blocking the binding sites for the 40S ribosomal subunit and for other translation initiation signals. Alternatively, the formation of a double-stranded DNA/RNA complex can render the RNA susceptible to RNase H digestion. The antigene approach is based on the binding of an antisense or sense DNA to the complimentary DNA sequence in the nucleus thus forming a triplex structure. This triplex prevents the transcription of the DNA coding sequence into mRNA.

12/1/24, 10:06 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much for the kind wishes I am glad to know that you are confident with your decision to choose India as the country for Nyshadzashe's higher education. I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263783979366 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve? <This message was edited>

12/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving towards the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
