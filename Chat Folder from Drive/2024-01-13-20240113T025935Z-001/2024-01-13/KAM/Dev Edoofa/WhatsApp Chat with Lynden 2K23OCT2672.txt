18/12/23, 12:42 PM - You joined using this group's invite link
29/12/23, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Lynden

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 8:58 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 5:17 AM - +263 77 842 2583: Good morning thank you very much, I was attending a wedding for my daughter. Wishing everyone one, also a Happy and Blessed New Year.
2/1/24, 6:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Eevning dear parent and my dear student!

I hope you had your wonderful holidays with your loved ones. As we embark on a furitful fresh new year. May I know if you are now reay to proceed with the session for the admisison process for today?
2/1/24, 6:47 PM - +263 77 842 2583: Yes am prepared
2/1/24, 7:51 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any addional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
2/1/24, 8:04 PM - +263 77 842 2583: You go ahead and explain
2/1/24, 8:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500.
2/1/24, 8:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
2/1/24, 8:30 PM - +263 77 842 2583: As for me, I have two nostro account which I will safely keep my money, and would be having readily the $3000 at hand for my twins in those 10 months
2/1/24, 9:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end. I would like to let you know that I am now closing my session for today and let us proceed with the session tomorrow. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family.
2/1/24, 9:50 PM - +263 77 842 2583: Thank you
3/1/24, 6:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
3/1/24, 8:10 PM - +263 77 842 2583: I was driving now am home we can proceed
3/1/24, 8:36 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that it is mandatory for all the students fo edoofa for the year of intake 2025. <This message was edited>
3/1/24, 8:46 PM - +263 77 842 2583: Ok
4/1/24, 8:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing a fine evening today. I would like to let you know that I was not able to further connect with you recently as I was occupied with multiple calls with the university. To make up for this let us connect tomorrow at 6:00 PM for further process for our session.
4/1/24, 8:52 PM - +263 77 842 2583: Ok will be on standby
5/1/24, 6:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well today. How are you doing this lovely evening?
5/1/24, 7:03 PM - +263 77 842 2583: Evening, I am fine
5/1/24, 7:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
5/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 77 842 2583: Yes I am ready
5/1/24, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
5/1/24, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
5/1/24, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
5/1/24, 7:11 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
5/1/24, 7:15 PM - +263 77 842 2583: It's a huge relief on my part and it will go a long way in reducing the burden
5/1/24, 7:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
5/1/24, 7:49 PM - +263 77 842 2583: Correct
5/1/24, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
5/1/24, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
5/1/24, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
5/1/24, 7:52 PM - +263 77 842 2583: Very logical and to my advantage
5/1/24, 8:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
5/1/24, 8:25 PM - +263 77 842 2583: The financial plan I have fully understood
5/1/24, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
5/1/24, 8:37 PM - +263 77 842 2583: Sunday I will be traveling taking my kids back to school, Monday will leave them at school. Tuesday, will spend the day at my rural home, network is a problem. Wednesday I will be traveling back. I think Thursday will be back in Kariba and we can continue at 6PM
5/1/24, 8:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. In that case, may I know if we shall contiue on Thursday?
5/1/24, 8:45 PM - +263 77 842 2583: Yes Thursday we will continue
5/1/24, 8:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Have a great day ahead.
5/1/24, 9:06 PM - +263 77 842 2583: Thank you

However, since Lynden is going to be occupied with school and you may be occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 12:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].
