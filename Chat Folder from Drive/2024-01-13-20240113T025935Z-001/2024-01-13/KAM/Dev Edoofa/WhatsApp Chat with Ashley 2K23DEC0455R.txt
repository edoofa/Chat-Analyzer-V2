6/1/24, 10:28 AM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
6/1/24, 10:33 AM - +263 77 377 5772: Sure , we can start now .
6/1/24, 10:43 AM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 77 377 5772: I have gone through the image sir.
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
6/1/24, 11:23 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
6/1/24, 11:40 AM - +263 77 377 5772: Yes, they are very well understood and clear sir.
6/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
6/1/24, 11:53 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
6/1/24, 12:01 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Yes lm following.
6/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/1/24, 12:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/1/24, 12:08 PM - +263 77 377 5772: All clear Mr. Dev
6/1/24, 12:10 PM - +263 77 377 5772: So the registration fee is to be paid before going to lndia.
6/1/24, 12:17 PM - Dev Edoofa: Yes @263773775772, the registration fees is paid while the student is still in the home country. Once we move forward with the further process, you will soon get to know how and when this fees is to be paid.
6/1/24, 12:18 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Noted sir
6/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
6/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure.
8/1/24, 9:03 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ashley!
I hope all of you are doing great. While I was wrapping up my day, I observed that we were not able to have a smooth discussion for the past couple of days, which has led to some delay in the admission process. We are aware of your immense trust in us and we surely care about your future. Considering that in mind, I wanted to schedule a specific session tomorrow at 8:30 am so that we can cover the process we are lagging behind,  and ensure that your admission process is on track. Hence, I wanted to understand if you will be available for our session at 8:30am. If not, I would like you to please let me know at what time between 8:30 am to 4 pm will you be available?
8/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 71 745 9650: I will be available at 8.30 am
8/1/24, 9:09 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Greetings to you
9/1/24, 8:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ashley!
I hope all of you are having a wonderful morning. I extremely excited to take forward your admission process today and I trust that you are as well. Let's start with our session.
9/1/24, 3:39 PM - +263 77 377 5772: How are doing.We are doing great as well
9/1/24, 4:24 PM - +263 71 745 9650: Good afternoon sir , my apologies for not responding to the messages , today was the opening of schools and l was occupied with some school stuff
9/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 745 9650: I'm very sorry sir. Tomorrow l will surely be available.
9/1/24, 8:18 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ashley.

I hope all of you are having a wonderful day. Today I had a meeting with the academic board and I was discussing the current status of your application file and in the same discussion, the team higjlighted that we have been a bit off track for the discusisons we were suppsed to completed and hence I wanted to reach out to you and just reiteratre the agenda of the sessions/discusisons we have in place.
9/1/24, 8:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: The agenda for these sessions is to help you understand the process Ashley will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since Ashley is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
9/1/24, 8:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you see, our goal is to help you prepare for your child's education abroad, that is something that is going to require a significant time. It requires months of planning. Hence, to do that perfectly and be prepared, as a parent, you would have to contribute an hour daily for at least 10 days so that we can be in sync and make the right decisions.
9/1/24, 8:19 PM - Dev Edoofa: We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
9/1/24, 8:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your inputs and find the right time for our sessions.
9/1/24, 9:20 PM - +263 71 745 9650: 09:00 AM is the best
9/1/24, 9:27 PM - +263 77 377 5772: Good evening team,we are very sorry sure for not being able to coorperate very well due to network problem and also time alocation
10/1/24, 9:17 AM - +263 71 745 9650: Good morning to you all.
How are you doing today ?
12/1/24, 11:14 AM - +263 71 745 9650: Greetings to you all.
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ashley!
I hope all of you are doing well. I have taken note of the above timings that were shared by you. I would like you to kindly provide me with some time to look into my schedule and provide you with confirmation regarding this. I hope you understand!
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then, with great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 1:34 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
