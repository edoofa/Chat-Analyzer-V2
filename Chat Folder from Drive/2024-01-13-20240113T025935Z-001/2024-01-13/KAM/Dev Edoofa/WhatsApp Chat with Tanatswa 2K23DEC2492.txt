9/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Good afternoon sir we are all fine
9/1/24, 1:39 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Sir I will be leaving for school tomorrow and we are not allowed to go with cellphones so are you comfortable to carry on without me

9/1/24, 1:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I completely understand your situation. What we can do is that, since you are going to be unavailable for further sessions, your parents/guardians can take part in these sessions and regularly update you with the proceedings in these sessions.

9/1/24, 1:57 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
9/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes we can start sir
9/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Good afternoon,i am available for some time. We can proceed.
9/1/24, 2:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: <Media omitted>
9/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 77 238 5097: I have gone through it.
9/1/24, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
9/1/24, 2:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
9/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Yes Mr ,they are clear.
9/1/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes they are clear sir
9/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
9/1/24, 2:45 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
9/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes I am following
9/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
9/1/24, 2:50 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
9/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes sir
9/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Does the student acquire the VISA on their own or you will assist
9/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 77 238 5097: We will assist her.
9/1/24, 3:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Our DSW team is going to assist you in acquiring a visa and help you with the total process. I hope I was able to clear your query?
9/1/24, 3:09 PM - +263 78 499 5799: Yes you did clear it sir
9/1/24, 4:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that! Since our operational hours are over, we will reconnect tomorrow to move forward with our session. Till then I will share with you the First step, i.e., *Message from the founder's office*.
9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

9/1/24, 4:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
9/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Tanatswa, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.
9/1/24, 4:16 PM - Dev Edoofa: Have a great evening ahead!
9/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 238 5097: Same to you Mr Kumar.
12/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!

With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'

The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
12/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
12/1/24, 12:54 PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.
