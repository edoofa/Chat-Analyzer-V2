18/12/23, 12:31 PM - You joined using this group's invite link
29/12/23, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Hilton

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 5:33 PM - +263 71 587 1373: I am doing fine how are you doing?
29/12/23, 5:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:00 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Yes I am
29/12/23, 6:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
29/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Yes
29/12/23, 6:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Yes
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
29/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Alrighttt
29/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Noted
29/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 71 587 1373: It sound okay
29/12/23, 6:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/12/23, 8:27 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Yes understood
29/12/23, 8:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

Over the past year, having the privilege of supporting numerous students, including you, in your pursuit of higher education has been truly rewarding. Witnessing our students thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has brought immense satisfaction.
6/1/24, 11:35 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The decision to transition to a new phase in my life presents an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of students, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience remain enriched and fulfilling.

As I embark on this new journey, I want to assure you that I have entrusted your application file to capable hands. From this point forward, your admission journey will be seamlessly guided by one of our accomplished admission officers, *Mr. Dev,* who will connect with you on Monday.  I hope you will make yourself available for the further procedures and will give your best to your career.

9/1/24, 9:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Hilton,

I am *Mr. Dev Kumar, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honored to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realizing your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 9:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:44 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

12/1/24, 10:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you so much @263771801437. I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263771801437 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve? <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 12:04 PM - +263 77 180 1437: Sorry for the late response i am at work
12/1/24, 12:07 PM - +263 77 180 1437: This year i want to read more books and spend more time with the family and just live in the moment
12/1/24, 3:32 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you want to become a better version of yourself by giving time to yourself which is much needed for well being. I appreciate it.
12/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving towards the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
12/1/24, 3:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you want to become a better version of yourself by equipping new skills and helping others in need. This is something that is much appreciated to hear from such young minds who are already mature enough to be aware of the aspects they need to work on. I must commend this.
