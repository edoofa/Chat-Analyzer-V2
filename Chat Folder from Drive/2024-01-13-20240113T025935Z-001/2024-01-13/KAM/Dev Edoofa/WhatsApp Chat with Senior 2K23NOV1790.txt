21/12/23, 3:05 PM - +263 78 838 3513: 2.Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further
explanation of the difference in Human Rights and Civil Rights.


The difference between rights and duties is that rights are freedoms or entitlements that a person has, while duties are obligations or responsibilities that a person has. Rights are often legally protected, while duties may not be. Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that all humans are entitled to, regardless of their nationality, race, gender, or other factors. Civil rights are the specific rights and freedoms that are guaranteed by the laws of a country, such as the right to vote, the right to due process, and the right to equal protection under the law. 

Furthermore,Rights are the freedoms that a person has, while duties are the obligations that a person has. Rights are about what a person can do, while duties are about what a person must do. Rights are often seen as "positive" entitlements, while duties are seen as "negative" obligations.
Rights are often seen as legally enforceable, while duties may be seen as more moral or ethical obligations. For example, the right to free speech is a legal right that is protected by law.


To elaborate further, human rights are based on the idea that all people are entitled to certain basic freedoms, such as the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These rights are often enshrined in national constitutions and international treaties, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Civil rights, on the other hand, are those that are specific to a particular country or region, and may not be as widely recognized. For example, the right to vote is a civil right in many countries, but it is not a human right that is recognized by all nations.

However, Rights are freedoms that a person has, while duties are obligations that a person has. The two are often intertwined, with rights giving people the freedom to do what they want, and duties giving people the responsibility to use that freedom in a way that benefits everyone. The concept of rights and duties can vary depending on the context, but they are always about balancing the needs and interests of individuals and the wider society. 

To put it simply, rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. Without rights, people would not have the freedom to pursue their own interests. Without duties, there would be no social order or protection for the weak and vulnerable. They go hand in hand, and both are necessary for a just and functioning society. It's important to remember that the exact nature of rights and duties may vary depending on the society and context, but the underlying principle remains the same. 

To conclude,There are many difference between rights and duties. One cannot turn a blind eye on some similarities of rights and duties.
21/12/23, 3:10 PM - +263 78 838 3513: 4.Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Corporate or Criminal,
and why?


Reasons to prefer criminal law is that it can be seen as a more "pure" form of law, since it's focused on protecting the public interest. Criminal law also has a clear and well-defined structure, with clear rules and procedures. Criminal law also offers the chance to see justice served and wrongs made right. Finally, it's a challenging and engaging area of law, with plenty of opportunities for growth and development.

Criminal law has a clear and well-defined structure. There are established rules and procedures that must be followed in every case. For example, there are strict rules about what evidence can be used, and how it must be presented. There are also clear guidelines for how the prosecution and defense must behave, and what they are allowed to do. This structure ensures that everyone is treated fairly and has the same rights and protections. It also makes the process more transparent and understandable for everyone involved. 

Seeing justice served is one of the most satisfying parts of working in criminal law. When someone has broken the law and caused harm, it can be very gratifying to see them held accountable and punished for their actions. This is especially true when the victim is able to see justice served, and they can feel some sense of closure 
and healing. Even if the criminal justice system isn't perfect, it can still be very meaningful to see it working to make things right.

Moreso,When we talk about "wrong made right" in criminal law, we're referring to the idea of "restorative justice". This is a concept that focuses on repairing the harm that has been done, rather than just punishing the offender. For example, a victim of a crime may be able to receive compensation for their losses, or the offender may be required to do community service or other forms of restitution. In this way, the wrong can be made right in a way that goes beyond simply locking someone .

Criminal law is designed to treat everyone fairly and equally, regardless of their background or status. This is known as the principle of "equality before the law". Under this principle, everyone is entitled to the same rights and protections, and they should be treated in the same way by the criminal justice system. This means that rich and poor, famous and unknown, powerful and powerless, should all be treated equally. For example, everyone has the right to a fair trial, the right to an attorney, and the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

In conclusion, criminal law is an important part of the legal system, and it has many benefits. It provides a way to hold people accountable for breaking the law, it can make victims feel better by seeing justice served, and it treats everyone fairly and equally. Criminal law is an ever-evolving field, and it will continue to play a crucial role in society.
21/12/23, 4:04 PM - +263 78 838 3513: 3.What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney
There are several differences between a prosecutor and an attorney. A prosecutor is a lawyer who works for the government, and their job is to bring criminal charges against people accused of crimes. An attorney, on the other hand, is a lawyer who can represent people in any legal matter, including both criminal and civil cases. In addition, prosecutors only represent the state, while attorneys can represent individuals, businesses, or organizations. Prosecutors also have the power to decide whether to bring charges against someone, while attorneys do not have that power. 

In addition, There are several other differences between prosecutors and attorneys. Prosecutors are often salaried government employees, while attorneys can be private practitioners or work for firms. Prosecutors typically have a lot of experience with the criminal justice system, while attorneys may specialize in other areas of the law. Finally, prosecutors are usually bound by ethical rules and laws that prevent them from disclosing certain information about their cases, while attorneys are not always subject to the same restrictions.

Furthermore, some of different roles of prosecutors and attorneys, we can explore that as well. As mentioned before, prosecutors work for the government and bring criminal charges against people. They also work with law enforcement to investigate crimes, and they make decisions about whether to offer a plea deal or go to trial. Attorneys, on the other hand, can represent either the prosecution or the defense in a case. They interview witnesses, prepare evidence, and make arguments on behalf of their clients. In this way, prosecutors and attorneys have complementary but different roles in the criminal justice system. 

Moreso, There are different types of attorneys. First, there are civil attorneys, who handle disputes between individuals or businesses. Then, there are criminal defense attorneys, who represent people who have been accused of a crime. There are also family law attorneys, who specialize in matters like divorce, child custody, and adoption. And there are also personal injury attorneys, who handle cases involving injuries that people have suffered. There are many more types of attorneys, but these are some of the most common.

Appart from the above , there are also some similarities between prosecutors and attorneys. For example, both types of lawyers are required to have a law degree, and both must pass a bar exam. Both types of lawyers must also adhere to ethical standards of conduct, such as confidentiality and honesty. Additionally, both prosecutors and attorneys must have strong research, writing, and communication skills. And finally, both types of lawyers must be prepared to argue their cases in court if necessary. 

In conclusion, both prosecutors and attorneys play crucial roles in our legal system. Prosecutors enforce the law and hold people accountable for breaking it, while attorneys represent and advocate for their clients. While there are some similarities between the two professions, there are also many important differences. These differences reflect the different roles that prosecutors and attorneys play in our society. It's important to understand these differences in order to appreciate the complexity of our legal system.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve?

Another aspect is my willingness to challenge myself  and learn new things as i pursue a career in law. Additionally, my change in approach towards life could involve developing strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for a career in law.
12/1/24, 8:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you want to become a better version of yourself by equipping new skills related to your field. This is something that is much appreciated to hear from such young minds who are already mature enough to be aware of the aspects they need to work on. I must commend this.
12/1/24, 8:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving towards the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 8:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 8:36 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
