*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/12/23, 8:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.

Firstly as an Edoofian they are required to have some qualities so as to become great at what you aim for in your career therefore being required to be a good listener and doing what needs to be done that is following instructions and also to be teachable that's being able to listen and grasp a concept the Edoofa program requires you to do .

Secondly an Edoofian aimes to be best in their career choice ...and there is the Edoofa program wanting to see an Edoofian do greater than best in their career paths and also wanting them to see success as independent individuals in life and their societies .

Thirdly the Edoofa program wishes for their enrolled students to have an affordable  tertiary education internationally in India ,thereby there to guide the upcoming Edoofians to acquire greater scholarships and also being able to earn scholarship credits for all the  universities in their program offer this enthusiastic EWYL program for all their students to acquire their scholarship credits also helping in reducing their tution fees .

And last, but not least , an Edoofian needs to have certain basic  skills of being able to convince the universities , so that the persons are thrilled and anxious to know what is it best of an Edoofian has to offer to their environment and all this is accompanied by a document that is called the Statement of Purpose .Also allowing the Edoofian to share their traits ,solid educational archievements and their strengths

2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
2/1/24, 7:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
2/1/24, 8:47 PM - +263 77 358 2224: Yes all in line

3. My dream company is Team Lease there in India and it is because this company offers a variety of employment opportunities to a variety of engineers who specialize in different paths .This is best for me because l love to see other engineers do their work not from my section so that l get to also learn how they do it and come up with a good result because you never know where this life takes one day l may need to use that kind of knowledge.
