*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
28/12/23, 8:28 PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yes I do understand
28/12/23, 8:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
28/12/23, 8:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
28/12/23, 8:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

29/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 312 4048: *QUESTION 2* 

 The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only change form or be transferred from one object to another. Image of ice cream cone (chemical energy) being converted to motion of kids riding bikes (kinetic energy)

2nd Law of Thermodynamics - For a spontaneous process, the entropy of the universe increases. 

3rd Law of Thermodynamics - A perfect crystal at zero Kelvin has zero entropy. 

 Some examples of thermodynamic systems are washing machines, refrigerators and air-conditioners.

Air-conditioner is a closed system that circulates refrigerant inside the system, altering the pressure of the refrigerant at different points to promote the transfer of heat. 

 Human metabolism is the conversion of food into heat transfer, work, and stored fat. Metabolism is an interesting example of the first law of thermodynamics in action.

Melting of ice cube: Ice cubes in a drink absorb heat from the drink making the drink cooler. If we forget to drink it, after some time, it again attains room temperature by absorbing the atmospheric heat. All this happens as per the first and second law of thermodynamics.
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 312 4048: *Question 3* 
A valve is a device or natural object that regulates, directs or controls the flow of a fluid e.g liquids and gases
 by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways. Valves are technically fittings, but are usually discussed as a separate category.

 Butterfly valves are used where space is limited. Unlike gate valves, butterfly valves can be used for throttling or regulating flow as well as in the full open and fully closed position. The pressure loss through a butterfly valve is small in comparison with the gate valve.


A butterfly valve  actuator controls the flow of gas or liquid by means of a disk, which turns on a diametrical axis inside a pipe or by two semicircular plates hinged on a common spindle, which permits flow in only one direction.

 Butterfly valves are a type of quarter-turn valve that feature a rotating disc element that allows, controls, and obstructs the fluid flow in a pipeline. They are valued for their compact size and simple construction and operating mechanism and for inducing a low pressure drop across the valve.

 Advantages of a Butterfly Valve The disc is lighter than a ball, and the valve requires less structural support than a ball valve of comparable diameter. Butterfly valves are very precise, which makes   little maintenance.
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 312 4048: *Question 4* 

Heat treating (or heat treatment) is a group of industrial, thermal and metalworking processes used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material. The most common application is metallurgical. Heat treatments are also used in the manufacture of many other materials, such as glass.

Heat treatment is commonly known as the process of heating metal without letting it reach its molten, or melting, stage, and then cooling the metal in a controlled way to select desired mechanical properties.

Common types of heat treating methods include annealing, hardening, quenching, and stress relieving, each of which has its own unique process to produce different results.  

 *The principle of heat treatment:* Heat treating  changes metal properties by heating the metal to a specific temperature, holding it at that temperature for a certain length of time, and then using one of several methods to control the cooling of the metal. A metal's properties are determined by the shape and alignment of its atoms.
29/12/23, 3:56 PM - +263 78 312 4048: *Question5* 

A compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume. An air compressor is a specific type of gas compressor. Compressors are similar to pumps: both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe.

There are primarily four types of compressors used in the air-conditioning industry: reciprocating, scroll, helical-rotary (or screw), and centrifugal.
Centrifugal compressors are used to power gas turbine engines used in jet aircraft, energy production, and other heavy industry applications. In a gas turbine, the centrifugal compressor transfers energy from impeller blades.

Turbines are commonly used due to high rotating speeds. Centrifugal compressors are used in pipeline booster service where high volume and low compression ratios exist. They are also used in very high flow rate gas lift service. They are not very well suited for high ratio, low-volume applications.
