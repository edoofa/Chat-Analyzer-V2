I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 6:31 PM - +263 77 382 4365: We are all well

29/12/23, 7:19 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months.

3/1/24, 6:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available to proceed with the session?
3/1/24, 7:02 PM - +263 77 382 4365: Yes
3/1/24, 7:43 PM - +263 71 726 1775: Sorry to answer you late.I think you can proceed
3/1/24, 7:55 PM - +263 71 726 1775: We are of the view that Ryan must work hard and score very high so that he will be given a high scholarship percentage.We him to score veryhigh
3/1/24, 8:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
3/1/24, 8:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
3/1/24, 8:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
4/1/24, 6:07 AM - +263 77 382 4365: Sounds good
4/1/24, 6:21 AM - +263 71 726 1775: I understand you say in the eleventh month we will be asked to open MasterCard bank account here in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. This account will help in Visa application.
You say depositing $1500 for the remaining 10 months might be expensive. So we will deposit only for four months. How much will that be? And when will the balance from $1500 paid?
4/1/24, 8:48 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That will be a total of $150 x 4 which is $600.
6/1/24, 11:25 AM - Shivjeet Edoofa added Dev Edoofa

This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

9/1/24, 9:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan,

I am *Mr. Dev Kumar, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honored to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realizing your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
9/1/24, 9:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
9/1/24, 9:42 PM - Dev Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test. This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
9/1/24, 9:43 PM - Dev Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
10/1/24, 6:52 AM - +263 77 382 4365: That's great
10/1/24, 6:53 AM - +263 77 382 4365: We started 2024 very well sir
10/1/24, 6:54 AM - +263 77 382 4365: Happy to have you on this platform
12/1/24, 10:16 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to know that you had a great start to the year and I hope you are excited for the new day and most importantly the new year as well. @263773824365 , the new year brings about a transformative mindset in us which may not emphasize immediate changes but a change in the direction that you believe is needed.

If I talk about myself, I have made a resolution to bring more humility in myself and bring about a change in my perspective to be a better version of myself all while ensuring that I help all of our students to achieve their educational goals. With that said, I would like to know what aspirations or a change in your approach towards life you wish to achieve? <This message was edited>
12/1/24, 10:41 AM - +263 77 382 4365: As of myself I want my son to aquire good course in your country
12/1/24, 4:20 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are determined to provide your children with as many opportunities as you to see them become successful individuals. It is appreciated.
12/1/24, 4:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, moving toward the admission process, We, at Edoofa, are determined to provide affordable higher education to hardworking students and assist them in launching their careers to greater heights. We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 4:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 4:21 PM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January]. This way, we can align it with our availability as well and help you move forward and make progress in a streamlined manner. Could you please let me know at what time you would be available from Monday to Friday between 08:00 AM and 06:00 PM? This would help us factor in your input and find the right time for our sessions.
12/1/24, 10:03 PM - +263 71 139 3748: 1PM to 6PM will be fine
