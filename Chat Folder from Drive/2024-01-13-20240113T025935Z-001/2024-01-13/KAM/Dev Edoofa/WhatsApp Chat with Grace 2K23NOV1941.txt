21/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
21/12/23, 8:27 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes,they are.
21/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:01 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Thank you,same to you.
27/12/23, 7:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Grace. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

It has been a while. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
27/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Good evening
27/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes l am.
27/12/23, 8:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above videos?
27/12/23, 8:05 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes
27/12/23, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
27/12/23, 8:27 PM - +263 78 688 6221: From the four videos that l watched l understood that as an Edoofian one should be open minded and be teachable therefore must follow instructions being given .Edoofa's vision is also not just to get students  affordable and quality education and making students employed but  it is  also  there  to increase students capacity  for success through making students more responsible and successful.
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 8:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 8:39 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
28/12/23, 6:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are having a wonderful evening with your family as we are approaching a New Year. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?

28/12/23, 6:10 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Yes l am
28/12/23, 7:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
28/12/23, 7:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 6:30 PM.
28/12/23, 7:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1.

This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

29/12/23, 4:58 PM - +263 78 688 6221: *QUESTION 2* 



The Business Process Management (BPM) life cycle encompasses the systematic approach to managing and improving business processes within an organization. It typically consists of six key phases:

1. Design: This phase involves identifying, analyzing, and designing the organization's business processes to align with its strategic objectives. It includes mapping out current processes, identifying areas for improvement, and designing new processes to achieve efficiency and effectiveness.

2. Modeling: In this phase, process models are created to visually represent the flow, activities, and interactions within the business processes. Modeling tools such as flowcharts, swimlane diagrams, and BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) are often used to document and communicate the processes.

3. Execution: Once the processes are designed and modeled, they are implemented and executed within the organization. This involves deploying the necessary technology, systems, and resources to support the execution of the processes.

4. Monitoring: The monitoring phase involves tracking and measuring the performance of the executed processes. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to assess process efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and ensure that the processes are delivering the desired outcomes.

5. Optimization: Based on the monitoring results, processes are continuously reviewed and optimized to enhance their performance. This phase involves identifying areas for improvement, making adjustments to the processes, and implementing best practices to achieve higher efficiency and effectiveness.

6. Automation: In this final phase, organizations may choose to automate certain aspects of the processes using technology solutions such as workflow management systems, business process management software, and robotic process automation (RPA) to streamline and standardize the execution of the processes.

Throughout the BPM life cycle, organizations strive to achieve greater agility, flexibility, and efficiency in their business processes, ultimately leading to improved overall performance and customer satisfaction.

29/12/23, 4:59 PM - +263 78 688 6221: **QUESTION 3* :How does business contribute to economic development* 



Businesses play a significant role in contributing to the economy through various means. Firstly, they generate income and employment opportunities, thus directly impacting the livelihoods of individuals and families. Businesses also contribute to economic growth by investing in infrastructure, innovation, and research and development, which in turn stimulate overall productivity and competitiveness. Furthermore, businesses pay taxes, thereby providing revenue to the government, which can be used for public services and infrastructure development.

An example of how business contributes to the economy is through the automotive industry. Car manufacturers and related businesses not only provide jobs to a large number of people, but they also stimulate economic activity in various other sectors, such as steel, rubber, electronics, and transportation. Additionally, the industry invests in research and development, leading to technological advancements and innovation. The taxes paid by these businesses further contribute to the government's revenue, which can be used for public services and infrastructure projects. Overall, the automotive industry's contribution exemplifies how businesses drive economic growth, create employment opportunities, and foster innovation and development.

29/12/23, 5:09 PM - +263 78 688 6221: *QUESTION 4* : *Explain with an example from your life which shows your managerial talent/skills 
* 


I successfully led a team to accomplish our objectives within a specified timeframe.

In this instance, I demonstrated my managerial talent by initiating and overseeing the project planning phase, which involved setting clear goals, assigning tasks based on team members' strengths, and establishing a timeline for completion. Through effective delegation and communication, I ensured that each team member understood their responsibilities and the overall project vision, thereby optimizing our collective efforts.

Furthermore, I actively monitored the project's progress, addressing any obstacles that arose and adjusting our strategies as necessary to maintain momentum. For instance, when we encountered a setback due to conflicting schedules, I facilitated open discussions with team members to identify feasible solutions, ultimately reassigning tasks and adjusting deadlines to accommodate everyone's availability without compromising the project's quality.

Moreover, my ability to cultivate a supportive and collaborative environment within the team was evident in my approach to conflict resolution and motivation. By acknowledging individual contributions, providing constructive feedback, and fostering a positive team dynamic, I effectively managed interpersonal relationships and inspired enthusiasm for our collective goals.

Ultimately, our project's successful completion within the designated timeframe and the positive feedback received from our peers and instructors serve as tangible evidence of my managerial talent and skills. This experience not only highlighted my ability to organize, coordinate, and lead a team but also underscored my proficiency in problem-solving, communication, and adaptability, all of which are integral to effective managerial prowess.

29/12/23, 5:12 PM - +263 78 688 6221: *QUESTION 5*:
 *Explain the importance of human resource in an Organization* 





Human resources play a crucial role in an organization's success and sustainability. Firstly, the HR department is responsible for recruiting, selecting, and retaining talented individuals who are essential for achieving the organization's goals. They ensure that the workforce is skilled, diverse, and well-suited to meet the demands of the job roles. Additionally, HR is instrumental in fostering a positive work culture and employee engagement, which directly impacts productivity, motivation, and overall job satisfaction.

Furthermore, human resources are responsible for developing and implementing policies and procedures that ensure compliance with labor laws and regulations, thus mitigating legal risks for the organization. They also administer employee benefits, manage performance evaluations, and provide training and development opportunities, all of which contribute to employee satisfaction and professional growth.

Moreover, HR plays a critical role in conflict resolution and employee relations, thereby maintaining a harmonious and productive work environment. They also act as a liaison between employees and management, addressing concerns and advocating for fair and ethical treatment.

In essence, the importance of human resources in an organization lies in their ability to attract, develop, and retain a high-performing workforce, while also ensuring legal compliance and fostering a positive work environment conducive to productivity and growth.

10/1/24, 2:03 PM - +263 78 688 6221: Good afternoon
10/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 688 6221: There are many things that inspire me in life, but one of the biggest inspirations for me are my parents .  They have  always been such  hard working  and positive parents, and they also  taught me the importance of perseverance and gratitude.  As for changes I would like to make, I'm working on being more organized and productive in my day-to-day life.  I've started using a planner and setting small, achievable goals for myself each day.
12/1/24, 11:19 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that you are able to understand the hardships that parents go through to provide their children with opportunities and ensure that their children are raised with good values. I truly appreciate your parents for the same.

We will be able to help you only if we can connect timely and have healthy discussions.
12/1/24, 11:20 AM - Dev Edoofa: Now, this is something I want to inform you all that the agenda for the discussions, that we are going to have, is to help you all understand the process you will undertake for his university admission journey and what your family will be experiencing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program over the next one and a half years. However, since you are going to be occupied with school and your parents are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.
12/1/24, 11:21 AM - Dev Edoofa: With that being said, what I can do right now to solve this constraint is give you the freedom to choose the time slot for our sessions over the next 10 days [till 20th January].
