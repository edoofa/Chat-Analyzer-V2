I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?
12/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 293 1083: I am Mrs Chitsatse I work for Church organization as an Accounts clerk, it is my pleasure introducing myself to you about the scholarship program for our daughter Nokutenda
12/01/24, 9:40 am - +263 77 293 1083: The motivation I got is that my child is going to have an opportunity to upgrade herself to a better future through attaining a course of her choice
12/01/24, 9:40 am - +264 81 788 4039: As the father  ,I am a Registered Nurse  , I value academic and professional education and wish my children to even go further than I did and become better people in their professional endeavors  .
12/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 71 254 3062: First and foremost i am Nokutenda Chitsatse , i am a girl aged 19 . I recently completed my Advanced Level Examinations and i am waiting for better results. I just wish to study more about Accounting in order for me to a Chartered Accountant.  My strength being that i really enjoy dealing with calculations rather than reading . I enjoy being part of clubs for instance EMA Club the one which carters with the cleanliness of the environment.
12/01/24, 9:46 am - +264 81 788 4039: For Nokutenda, I see this opportunity as a window to enter the first world and learn in enabling environment  ,where honestly there are less learning challenges than this side of the world where learning is hampered by constant power outages, teacher strikes ,political interruptions  ,resource shortages in terms of technology and so on
12/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 293 1083: It will be a dream come true for my daughter to fulfill her dream career in accounting through your assistance to her  with a scholarship
12/01/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Nokutenda and Mrs and Mr Chitsatse, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to know of Nokutenda's interest as a student while I thoroughly appreciate your thoughts on the importance of education as a parent!
12/01/24, 9:48 am - +264 81 788 4039: Further, allow me to say tuition fees will forever be the biggest challenge for us
12/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 71 254 3062: Thank you so much Ms Harmehak
12/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 71 254 3062: I would like to study abroad as there is a better  environment and working industry and infrastructure , there is also enough exposure, and  advanced technolody and continuous education without interactions like power cuts, frequent demonstrations etc

12/01/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: I do understand.
12/01/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Well put across, Nokutenda,

I can see are well aware of your goals in life.
12/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 71 254 3062: Thank you Ms Harmehak
12/01/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Well Nokutenda, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
12/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 71 254 3062: Yes it is a life changing decision as they are many things that hampers education here in Africa for example corruption, politics , family issues , shortages of accommodation and very long distances to the campus ect. So studying abroad is quite very nice as there are better living conditions , better communication and transport skills , advanced technology and sometimes family issues are less involved as one will be faraway
12/01/24, 10:14 am - Harmehak: You see, Nokutenda, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
12/01/24, 10:18 am - +264 81 788 4039: I concur, our situation is heart breaking .I am happy you have first hand information
12/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 77 293 1083: I.am glad Mr Piyush was in Zimbabwe and managed to witness it all by himself
12/01/24, 10:23 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
12/01/24, 10:23 am - Harmehak: So Nokutenda, would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
12/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 71 254 3062: Thank you for the insight. I just hope i will get the scholarship so that the same challenges won't haunt me. I would also like to proceed to the masters degree if i am done with the basic one , so I will be so grateful to get this scholarship.
12/01/24, 10:25 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
12/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 71 254 3062: Yes i am mentally prepared for a life abroad as long as i am accomplishing my dreams I am all in.
12/01/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Nokutenda, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your parents are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially along with the scholarship?
12/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 71 254 3062: Yes my parents are willing to support me in every step of the way
12/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate their support.
12/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 71 254 3062: Yes i am confident and I am just hoping for better results so that i will be able to get this opportunity of studying abroad.
12/01/24, 10:37 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
12/01/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: So, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Accounting ?
12/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 71 254 3062: I wrote 12 subjects and i had 
3 As
4 Bs
3 Cs
2 Ds
12/01/24, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Do you have your results in a picture format too?
12/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 71 254 3062: Yes but i need to find where they are and i will send you
12/01/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: You can share them later in the day.
12/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 71 254 3062: Its okay fine
12/01/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Meanwhile, do address the other half
12/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 71 254 3062: I want to study Accounting because I am very passionate with it . I really enjoy dealing with calculations and working with large amounts.

12/01/24, 10:58 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Mr Chitsatse.
12/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 71 254 3062: Thank you so much Ms Harmehak for highlighting more crucial information about my desired course.
12/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 293 1083: Thank you Ms Harmehak for the broad scope of courses on offer she will have a wide choice of selection
12/01/24, 11:03 am - +264 81 788 4039: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: Received please
12/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome.
12/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: Alright Nokutenda, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 254 3062: I see myself as an qualified Chartered Accountant who has all the experience and techniques , doing audits for the government , working for large accounting firms for example Deloitte , Ernst and Young etc . I am also seeing my self having my own accounting firm creating vacancies for other experienced experts.
12/01/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: That is really great Nokutenda, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 71 254 3062: I want to study abroad because it has so many advantages . I will be able to learn without many distractions for examples family affairs like sickness , funerals etc , there will be no house hold chores included in my learning process that will disturb me from doing my assignments. I would want to study abroad as there is improved technology and electricity. Here in Zimbabwe sometimes there is loadshedding which is very unfornate in times of studying and also there are no enough gadgets that can accommodate everyone. At National level also teachers can not attend classes sometimes due to low wages , strikes etc which is a disadvantage . Sometimes there is no availability of transport to go to the campus which sometimes delays the learning process  .
12/01/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing, Nokutenda,

Having shared the same I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

The Edoofa schoolarship is there to  solve problems like the lack of affordability of quality education, employability outcome of graduates etc
12/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Nokutenda.

12/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 71 254 3062: Thank you so much Ms Harmehak for the detailed information and scope
12/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/01/24, 1:16 pm - +264 81 788 4039: If I may  come in,I should hasten to say ,yes,we are aware and may not be familiar with the figures but absolutely aware there are high costs ,and I am afraid we may not afford them
12/01/24, 1:18 pm - +264 81 788 4039: However it looks the benefits would outweigh the costs compared to our home situation where the costs are not anywhere near any sort of tangible benefit
12/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing please.

I would assist you in the best way possible.
12/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 1:28 pm - +264 81 788 4039: Thank you for the insight  ,well understood
12/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Chitsatse, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
12/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 71 254 3062: I am glad to know more about India Ms Harmehak
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
12/01/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware that the child of the Deputy Head of Mount Selinda is also a part of the program, please?
12/01/24, 2:03 pm - +264 81 788 4039: I feel it is affordable and to a greater extent a relief  to our dire financial or income levels
12/01/24, 2:04 pm - +264 81 788 4039: Really  , glad to know that
12/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
12/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Mr Chitsatse.
12/01/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
12/01/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/01/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/01/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/01/24, 2:46 pm - +264 81 788 4039: Thank you
12/01/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/01/24, 2:49 pm - +264 81 788 4039: This is so encouraging and exiting
12/01/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
12/01/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 293 1083: Thnk you so much for further explanations about the scholarship
12/01/24, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
12/01/24, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/01/24, 2:57 pm - +263 77 293 1083: Wow thank you this is amazing  and so encouraging
12/01/24, 3:02 pm - +263 71 254 3062: Thank you so much Ms Harmehak  I am delighted and i am also convinced
12/01/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
12/01/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 3:05 pm - +263 71 254 3062: Yes its  totally different
12/01/24, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/01/24, 3:27 pm - +263 71 254 3062: Yes i am ready
12/01/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: Nokutenda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/01/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 71 254 3062: $400
12/01/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: How much is $300x 5 and $450x5, Nokutenda?
12/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 254 3062: $300 × 5= 1500
$450 × 5= 2250
12/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 71 254 3062: That is so nice
12/01/24, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: Nokutenda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 71 254 3062: Yes i think so
12/01/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/01/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/01/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/01/24, 3:40 pm - +263 71 254 3062: Okay noted with thanks
12/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 71 254 3062: So basically how many points do you basically want
12/01/24, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: Do you recall the same?
12/01/24, 3:51 pm - +263 71 254 3062: Ohhh yes I recall
12/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
12/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/01/24, 3:57 pm - +263 71 254 3062: Yes i now properly understand
12/01/24, 3:59 pm - +263 71 254 3062: The stages are well explained
12/01/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/01/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
12/01/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

12/01/24, 4:03 pm - +263 71 254 3062: Thank you I am following
12/01/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/01/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/01/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 71 254 3062: Wow this is so amazing, i am in love with this
12/01/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.

As of now, do you have any queries, Nokutenda?
12/01/24, 4:08 pm - +263 71 254 3062: No Ms Harmehak so far so good . If there are any in due course I will ask you.
12/01/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Nokutenda!

Would Mrs and Mr Mr Chitsatse like to ask anything please?
12/01/24, 4:15 pm - +264 81 788 4039: Thank you so much Ms Harmehak . You explained everything very well.  We will ask you anything if there are any queries in the due course.
12/01/24, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.

You're very welcome please.
12/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 77 293 1083: Thank you so much Ms Harmehak for your time may God richly bless you, I have clearly understood everything explained
12/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “13-01-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
