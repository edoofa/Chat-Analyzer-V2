05/01/24, 9:15 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes we can  start
05/01/24, 9:17 am - Harmehak: Did you follow all the shared resources and information?
05/01/24, 9:19 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes I did
05/01/24, 9:20 am - Harmehak: That's great,

What's your take on the information you learnt yesterday?

Did you find it helpful and interesting?
05/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes I found it helpful and I had more insight about India
05/01/24, 9:27 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/01/24, 9:28 am - +263 77 103 0085: No
05/01/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Alright please
05/01/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/01/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/01/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/01/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 9:30 am - +263 77 103 0085: Wonderful it's affordable
05/01/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
05/01/24, 9:42 am - +263 77 103 0085: The program earn while you earn is of utmost importance and beneficial since it enables a student to reduce the remaining annual fee
05/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 77 103 0085: Ok I understand
05/01/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Tinotenda, active and thorough participation is very important.
05/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 103 0085: Ok I'm following
05/01/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 77 103 0085: Wonderful experience so with more accomplished assignments you will be able to gain more scholarship credits
05/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
05/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes I am ready
05/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Tinotenda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
05/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 103 0085: Around 1500 or more
05/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/01/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 103 0085: Okay so I will have to pay 350 by 31 January as enrolment fee
05/01/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: It's paid once/if you qualify and receive an acceptance letter.
05/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 77 103 0085: Okay I understand
05/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 103 0085: I totally agree with you
05/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 103 0085: Oh okay. Things are hard in Africa
05/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: We do understand please.
05/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Tinotenda, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Considering the same we do understand and this is why we aim at providing Affordable, Accessible and Employable education to our students!
05/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes it's true
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Indeed please!
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
05/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 103 0085: Yes I understand
05/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
05/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

05/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Meaning that classes are likely  to resume in august
05/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Okay
05/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
05/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
05/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Ok let me get in touch with her thank you
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

While I hope you are still in contact with Justine?
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same are you aware that Justine is currently in India?
05/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Yes I'm still in contact with him
05/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Yes he told me
05/01/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Do connect your parents with Justine as well.
05/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 103 0085: Ok I will
05/01/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
05/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
05/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

TOPIC: Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient?
To a greater extent the assertion that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient is not true. Many Africans have poor diets due to several factors for instance poor health facilities, inadequate education on health issues and prevailing economic situations which makes people be unable to afford basic education. Health facilities tend to have inadequate medicals which can treat diabetic clients which will ultimately affect clients with health issues. Inadequate education concerning food that should be consumed is one of the great causes of poor diets in Africa. If most Africans have appropriate education concerning healthy food that must be consumed there would be less cases on Africans having poor diets. To a lesser extent many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. The major reason behind this can be because of the prevailing economic situations.

07/01/24, 8:55 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
07/01/24, 8:55 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
07/01/24, 8:55 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
07/01/24, 8:55 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/01/24, 8:57 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th January 2024 for $200 and the  13th or 14th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 13th or 14th January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
