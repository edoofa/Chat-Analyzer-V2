You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

12/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 120 2514: Sorry about that the network here is a bit slow
12/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 78 120 2514: Ok I'm following
12/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 78 120 2514: *International Student Admission Eligibility Check:*

a) Nature of the Scholarship: Partial Scholarship or Fully Funded
Ans: Fully Funded 

b) Cost of Education after the Edoofa scholarship: $1500-$3000 or $6000-$8000
Ans: $6000-$8000

c) What, in your understanding, is the purpose of the EWYL Program? (Answer in 30-50 words)
Ans: I have understood that the EWYL program serves the purpose of providing under privileged People and people who have have the desire to study abroad with the Opportunity to study abroad and persue their studies in an Environment that is friendly and beneficial 
I also understand that students do not just benefit educationaly but even socially and spiritual through participating in Community events 

d) Why do you believe you should be accepted into the Edoofa Program? (Answer in 50-100 words)
Ans: I believe that I should be part of the Edoofa Program because I am gifted Educationally and I am willing to learn new things from the program and acquire new skills to put them to use in future and I am also keen to get involved in the Educational system of a different environment and It is my desire to study abroad but I always thought there is no window of opportunity for such a thing but The Edoofa Program has given a ray of hope and I hope I qm one of the deserving students 

e) Are your parents aware of the details shared above? If yes, will your parents/guardians be part of the admissions process?
Ans: Yes 

f) Slot for interview session:
12/01/24, 10:57 am - Harmehak: Your answer 1 and 2 are incorrect.
12/01/24, 10:57 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship, Anesu?
12/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 120 2514: I believe that it is a scholarship that you have all the expenses paid for by the program
12/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 78 120 2514: Oooj ok thanks for the enlightenment I was completely in the dark and I had the wrong idea of a scholarship
12/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: I understand
12/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: Now would you like to ask anything?
12/01/24, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, so I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
