*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Tadiwanashe Sabau. 

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for *Monday at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. 

(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video to go through and learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
3. Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you?
08/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 71 779 8528: The Edoofa program is more of an organization that helps in giving  students scholarships .The scholarship provided by Edoofa allows students to acquire knowledge in different career aspects of their choice thus helping then to chase their dreams

08/01/24, 4:30 pm - +263 71 779 8528: I think you with the current financial situation all over the world you are only offering Visa's only and also you might even provide the flight ticket given I have been awarded the scholarship
08/01/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa provides scholarship only on the tuition fee.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I have been expecting proper participation, for your application for Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
