08/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yes she did tell me about it
08/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 71 705 1560: Edoofa scholarship program is a gateway to a new future. After working in Higher Education for over a decade, the supremely talented team at Edoofa was able to start the prestigious Edoofa Program to help deserving students tackle the problem of lack of affordability and employability in  colleges and universities
08/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 71 705 1560: She taught me that Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
08/01/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Wonderful, I am glad you had a thorough discussion.
08/01/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
08/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yeah we did
08/01/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
08/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yes I'm indeed looking for this
08/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yeah my parents can't handle this financial burden alone that's why I applied for this scholarship
08/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Bridget, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
08/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 71 705 1560: I'm Bridget Zambukira.I'm a girl aged 18 years.I recently did my O level education in 2022 and I did very well. I'm an A Level student at Thornhill High School. I'm currently doing a combination of Pure Mathematics,Biology and Geography. I commute to school as the school is not very far from where I live. Thornhill charges around $90 per term.I wanted to be a pediatrician but now I'm not doing chemistry so I want to be a biomedical engineer. I'm very good in English and mathematics. That is where my strengths lies. I don't have a weakness that I know of yet. I'm into sports also . I love playing volleyball
08/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 71 705 1560: I live with both my parents and I have two siblings.

08/01/24, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Well Bridget now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
08/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 71 705 1560: This message was deleted
08/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 71 705 1560: One of the biggest advantages of studying abroad is the chance to experience another culture that's entirely different from your own. This enriching experience will help you see things in a different perspective. You will get to try new food, visit new places

 By studying abroad, you will experience new perspectives, learn how to
08/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 71 705 1560: With study abroad, you can experience new places and cultures, make friends from around the world, and gain a global perspective-while earning credits towards your degree. It will allow you to develop highly-valued skills such as intercultural communication, foreign languages, adaptability, and problem-solving.

 Enhanced Personal Growth While daunting at first, studying abroad builds resilience and self-confidence. Living in a foreign country can also help you develop a greater sense of empathy and understanding for others. Studying abroad allows you to explore new cultures, languages, and academic opportunities.
08/01/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: That's very correct, Bridget!

I can see that surely are well aware of the advantages of pursuing higher education abroad.

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
08/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yes I definitely am mentally prepared
08/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: Bridget, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
08/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yeah they will support me both mentally and financially but they will need assistance financially
08/01/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
08/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 71 705 1560: My financial position is not healthy enough to support my education abroad due to our country's economic situation..though my parents are willing to support me wholeheartedly  to see me achieve my educational goals
08/01/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: I do understand please.

So how are you planning your higher education in India from a financial aspect?
08/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 71 705 1560: I understand higher education needs a lot of financial investment eg tuition, accommodation, learning resources etc.
Currently our education investments were eroded my our country's econimic meltdown. Leaving our financial status in the negative. However my parents are thriving so provide support for me and my other siblings to attain better education.
However they are thriving to offer us support for me and my other two siblings to achieve our educational goals.
Hence my application for scholarship as a way out for me to achieve my educational goals
08/01/24, 11:03 am - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing as I am well aware of the situation there myself!
08/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 71 705 1560: I'm glad that you know
08/01/24, 11:03 am - Harmehak: You see, Bridget, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
08/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yeah it's true
08/01/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Indeed!

So are your parents willing to support you financially along with the scholarship, Bridget?
08/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yes they are
08/01/24, 11:14 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
08/01/24, 11:15 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
08/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 71 705 1560: I promise I will try my best and I'm confident also
08/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: That's great
08/01/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Biomedical engineering?
08/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 71 705 1560: Mathematics B
English A
Shona B
Biology C
Chemistry C
Physics C
Computer science C
Geography B
Combine science B
Accounts D
Pure Mathematics  E
08/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 71 705 1560: I want to be a biomedical engineer because it has to do with medical Sciences and I'm really into that
08/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 71 705 1560: Since I can't be a medical doctor <This message was edited>
08/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: While I do understand, Bridget!
08/01/24, 11:38 am - +263 71 705 1560: Okay
08/01/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: I can see you only pursued Biology!

Don't you believe Physics and Chemistry are equally important science subjects?
08/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yeah they are important also
08/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Correct!
08/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
08/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yeah I understand
08/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*
08/01/24, 11:50 am - +263 71 705 1560: Okay then Bachelor of science in medical laboratory technology
08/01/24, 11:52 am - Harmehak: Sure please
08/01/24, 11:53 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yes
08/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology or Cardiovascular Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.

Cardiovascular Technology involves the use of non-invasive procedures to diagnose and treat heart and blood vessel disorders. This field requires a strong foundation in biology and anatomy and offers courses in electrocardiography, echocardiography, and vascular technology. Students with a degree in Cardiovascular Technology can work in hospitals and clinics and can gain valuable experience in the field of cardiology.

Both Medical Laboratory Technology and Cardiovascular Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in one of these fields is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field.
08/01/24, 11:54 am - +263 71 705 1560: Okay I understand
08/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Meanwhile, now shall I brief you about your desired course, Bridget?
08/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 71 705 1560: Yes

08/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the shared resources thoroughly, Bridget?
08/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 71 705 1560: I am doing so right now
08/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Alright please

08/01/24, 12:46 pm - +263 71 705 1560: I'm done
08/01/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Did you find the information helpful and interesting, Bridget?

If so, how would studying in India help you achieve your desired life?
08/01/24, 12:50 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Yes
08/01/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Are you thoroughly following the discussion, Bridget?

There's a question too!
08/01/24, 12:52 pm - +263 71 705 1560: If I study in India I will have alot of opportunities in India as well as in other countries..and if I work diligently I know I will live a well organized life without financial problems
08/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Yeah I am
08/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: That's great
08/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
08/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: I understand
08/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 71 705 1560: No we are not
08/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
08/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Okay yeah it is very affordable
08/01/24, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Bridget, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
08/01/24, 1:01 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Yeah I'll aim for higher grades
08/01/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
08/01/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Bridget, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Yes I agree and it true also
08/01/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Bridget?
08/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Yes I am
08/01/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
08/01/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/01/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/01/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/01/24, 1:15 pm - +263 71 705 1560: I understand
08/01/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 71 705 1560: It is an advantage indeed
08/01/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
08/01/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Yeah different in a very good way
08/01/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
08/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Yes
08/01/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: Bridget, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
08/01/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/01/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Bridget_Edoofa(08/01)HP" to "Bridget_Edoofa(08/01)HP 2025"
08/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Around $1500-$2250
08/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Oh alright
08/01/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: You see, *Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission* and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Yeah I do
08/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
08/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Okay that is fair
08/01/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/01/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
08/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
08/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 71 705 1560: I did
08/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
08/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/01/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
08/01/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 2:01 pm - +263 71 705 1560: I'll surely contact her
08/01/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: Do connect Mrs Ruth with your parents!

Along with the same, feel free to connect your parents with Claire's parents to learn more about the entire experience.
08/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 71 705 1560: I will
08/01/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/01/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/01/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

08/01/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Dear Bridget and parents,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “09-01-23” at 10:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
08/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Okay but tomorrow around that time I will be at school
08/01/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: That's alright, you can participate after school and meanwhile you can request your parents to continue.
08/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 71 705 1560: They can't also they will be at work
08/01/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: You can join after school in that case.

Since your process is being evaluated for a higher quantum of scholarship, it will be appreciated if your parents can follow the discussion too.
08/01/24, 2:14 pm - +263 71 705 1560: Okay
08/01/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Stagnant Food Production, Rising Malnourishment Threaten Africa’s Ability to Feed Itself, Delegate Says as Second Committee Considers Agriculture, Food Security
28 October 2010
General AssemblyGA/EF/3292
Department of Public Information • News and Media Division • New York
Sixty-fifth General Assembly

Second Committee

20th & 21st Meeting (AM & PM)


Stagnant Food Production, Rising Malnourishment Threaten Africa’s Ability to Feed

Itself, Delegate Says as Second Committee Considers Agriculture, Food Security

Given its stagnant food production and rising levels of malnourishment, Africa would not be able to feed itself unless the outside world helped with money and technology to spur agriculture across the continent, Malawi’s representative told the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) today as it considered agriculture development and food security.


Speaking on behalf of the African Group, he said the continent’s food security situation had deteriorated faster than in other regions over the last 50 years.  It received 25 per cent of global food aid and at least 212 million of its people were undernourished in 2009, up from 44 million in 1996, he noted, emphasizing that agriculture and food security were among the surest ways for Africa to eradicate extreme poverty.


However, low-fertility soils, environmental degradation, scant technology and poor infrastructure were thwarting Africa’s best efforts to develop the agricultural sector, he said.  Smallholder farmers, mostly women, who produced at least 90 per cent of the continent’s food supply, were particularly affected but lacked the money to make improvements.  “Unless that trend is reversed, Africa will not be able to feed its population,” he warned, stressing that realization of the Millennium Development Goals would remain elusive without outside support.


Echoing those concerns, Ethiopia’s representative said the agricultural sector, which had suffered years of neglect and under-investment, must be placed high on the international development agenda, with greater spending on agricultural production — be it through official development assistance (ODA), foreign direct investment (FDI) or national-budget support.  International agricultural development policies should focus on improving smallholder farmers’ production and processing systems, he said, hailing the Secretary-General’s report on agriculture and food security, but noting that it should have laid greater emphasis on the need for progress in implementing the outcome of the World Summit on Food Security.


Presenting that report for the Committee’s consideration, the Chief of the Policy Analysis and Networks Branch in the Sustainable Development Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs cited it in noting that for the first time since 1970, more than 1 billion people were hungry or undernourished.  That figure had dropped to 925 million as of September 2010, but still represented 100 million more hungry people than a decade ago.  The number suffering from hunger worldwide had fallen from 20 per cent in 1990, but the world was still less than half way to achieving the first Millennium Goal of halving the number of hungry people by 2015.


He said that, while an emergency meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) last month had concluded that there was no indication of an impending world food crisis, new measures were still needed to check food-price volatility and manage associated risks.  The world was taking considerable global action to prevent a crisis through emergency food aid and revitalization of the agriculture sector.  For example, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme established in April had given grants to Bangladesh, Haiti, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Togo for the long-term growth and sustainability of smallholder farmers.


Noting that the Programme was expected to receive $1.5 billion in pledges over the next three years, he urged Governments to invest more in agricultural research and rural infrastructure; make affordable inputs available to support smallholder agriculture; prioritize under-nutrition as a problem in national development plans; and empower rural women by giving them equal access to productive resources, financing and markets.


Nepal’s representative, speaking on behalf of the Group of Least Developed Countries, called on the international community to reverse the declining trend of ODA for the agricultural sector, and urged it to live up to the commitments made at the 2009 L’Aquila Food Security Summit, especially by investing $20 billion over three years to encourage rural development.  The global food, financial and climate-change crises had gravely affected the efforts of least developed countries to achieve agricultural development and food security, he said.  They had also suffered from decades of under-investment in key infrastructure, over-dependence on a few primary commodities, and high prices for seeds, fertilizer and pesticides.


To break the vicious cycle of low productivity and rampant poverty, he continued, there was a need to invest in irrigation, to transfer knowledge and technology and to integrate the management of farming systems, without undermining time-tested indigenous knowledge and practices.  He also expressed deep concern over agricultural subsidies and called for an early conclusion of the Doha Development Round, in order to ensure the creation of non-distorted, non-discriminatory and equitable markets that could promote agricultural and rural development in least developed countries.


Australia’s representative shed light on steps that his country was taking to help least developed countries and others struggling with food security and agriculture development, saying it would spend $292 million on aid this year, and double its development assistance to $1.8 billion over the next five years to that end.  Australia would also contribute $50 million to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme.


Also during the meeting, the representatives of Yemen and Morocco introduced six draft resolutions on several agenda items.


Other speakers today were representatives of Belgium (on behalf of the European Union), Indonesia (on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, or ASEAN), Mauritania (on behalf of the Arab Group), Guyana (on behalf of the Caribbean Community, or CARICOM), Switzerland, United States, India, South Africa, Cuba, Saint Lucia, Iran, Botswana, Sudan, Thailand, Ukraine, Nicaragua, Oman, Congo, Sri Lanka, Peru, Morocco, Japan, Jordan, Afghanistan, Qatar, Mongolia, Russian Federation, Myanmar, Libya, Israel, Venezuela, Uganda, Niger, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia, Republic of Korea, Bangladesh, Brazil, Mexico, China, Senegal and Chile.


Representatives of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) also spoke.

Section 6
The Fisherman and the Businessman 

Once upon a time there was a businessman who was sitting on the beach in a small Italian village.

As he sat, taking a brief break from the stress of his daily schedule, he saw a fisherman rowing a small boat back into the harbour. In the boat were a few large fish.

Impressed, the businessman asked the fisherman, “How long does it take you to catch so many fish?” To which he replied “Oh, not so long.”

The businessman was confused, “Why don’t you fish for longer to catch even more?”

“More? This is enough to feed my entire family and even offer some to my neighbours,” the fisherman said.

“So what do you do for the rest of your day?” Enquired the businessman.

The fisherman replied, “Well, I’ve usually have caught my fish by late morning, at which point I go home, kiss my wife, and play with my kids. In the afternoon, I take a nap and read. In the evening, I go to the village to have a drink with my friends, play guitar, sing, and dance into the night!”

Putting his entrepreneurial hat on, the businessman offered a suggestion.

“I have a PhD in business! I can help you become much more successful. From now on, you should spend longer at sea and catch as many fish as possible. When you’ve saved enough money, buy a bigger boat to catch even more fish. From there, you’ll soon be able to buy more boats, set up your own company, build a production plant to can the fish and control distribution, and move to the city to control your other branches.”

To this, the fisherman asks, “And after that?”

The businessman laughs, “After that, you’ll be able to live like a king, take your company public, float your shares and be rich!”

“And after that?” Asks the fisherman once more.

“After that, you can retire, move to a house by the sea, wake up early in the morning to go fishing, then return home to play with your kids, kiss your wife, take a nap in the afternoon and join your friends in the village to drink, play guitar and dance into the night!”

Puzzled, the fisherman replies, “But isn’t that what I’m doing already?”

Moral of the story:

Be content with what you have. Do you really need to keep pushing for more? Stress is often a choice. There’s joy and peace in simplicity.
