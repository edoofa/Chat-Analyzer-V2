I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Seke 1 high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

Other than the school fees , i had to pay another $60 for my extra lessons . I did Maths , Physics and Chemistry as my combination....My strengths where in Physics while in Mathematics i was averagely good . As for my weakness , Chemistry was really tough for me . We really did not have an A level Chemistry teacher at our school . Having tht said i have always wanted to to Civil Engineering as my University Program . 

I am 19 years old as of now and im waiting for my A level results . I grew up in Craneborne n then my family relocated to Chitungwiza . We are a family of 5 and i am the second born . My mom is a teacher at Dotito Primary School . She is a single parent and she works tirelessly .

My father left and my mom look after us since then , my mom usually funds my education despite the financial instabilities . My father is abroad , he rarely caters for our needs , even education he rarely pay my fees . As of now im looking for a job maybe if by chance i raise enough money , i will be able to pay for my tertiary education
