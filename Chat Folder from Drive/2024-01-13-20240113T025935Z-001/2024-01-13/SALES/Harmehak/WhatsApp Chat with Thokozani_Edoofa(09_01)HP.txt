My weaknesses- loss of a loved one has been my greatest weakness 
Hobbies- l like to bake n cook

11/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Wow interesting
11/01/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: I understand
11/01/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Thokozani!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
11/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 77 360 0968: No  not really noone from my family has ever been to india
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: I do understand
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk l understand
11/01/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
11/01/24, 2:41 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Yeah thats a really good
11/01/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
11/01/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries?
11/01/24, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, so I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
11/01/24, 8:30 pm - +263 77 360 0968: No nothing
11/01/24, 8:31 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Apologies my phone shut and l had no where to charge it like l had mentioned we had no power today
11/01/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: I understand
11/01/24, 8:37 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Will do ..thank you
12/01/24, 9:06 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
12/01/24, 9:08 am - +263 77 360 0968: Morning..yes we may proceed
12/01/24, 9:09 am - Harmehak: Alright please
12/01/24, 9:10 am - Harmehak: Thokozani, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/01/24, 9:15 am - +263 77 360 0968: Yes thats an average estimation
12/01/24, 9:17 am - Harmehak: Indeed, so are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Thokozani?
12/01/24, 9:21 am - +263 77 360 0968: Yes it is to a greater extent.
12/01/24, 9:21 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
12/01/24, 9:21 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/01/24, 9:21 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/01/24, 9:21 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 360 0968: Are they tought how to do the work <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 9:40 am - Harmehak: You would have a dedicated mentor who would assist you with your EWYL projects.
12/01/24, 9:41 am - +263 77 360 0968: Ohhh owk owk thats good then
12/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Yes please
12/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 360 0968: Owk l understand this is a great program 🙏🏼
12/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/01/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: They depend on student's hardwork.
12/01/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 360 0968: Monthly or they are consistent
12/01/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 360 0968: Wow owk thats good then
12/01/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: You earn credits every month.
12/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 360 0968: Owk owk
12/01/24, 10:37 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 360 0968: Yes l ama
12/01/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Thokozani, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/01/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 77 360 0968: $1500-$2250
12/01/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/01/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 360 0968: Owk
12/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 360 0968: So we pay to be enrolled for the schoolarship program..and ld also have to pay for the university application
12/01/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: I hope after going through the same you have a better clarity regarding your question?
12/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 360 0968: So in simple terms the $350 caters for the above .
Includin university application fee <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Very correct, Thokozani
12/01/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/01/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 360 0968: Owk understood
12/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
12/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/01/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 360 0968: Yes l have
12/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 77 360 0968: So what happens if l dont get accepted to any university but accepted by the program
12/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Your fee is refunded
12/01/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 360 0968: With what assurance
12/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
12/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
12/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 360 0968: ?
12/01/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk
12/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 360 0968: So the visa is renewed yearly?
12/01/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: It's only renewed once you are here in India.
12/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Hmm ok
12/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 360 0968: And what assurance do l have for the refund if lm not admitted
12/01/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Thokozani, you only proceed ahead if you are found eligible.

I believe you recall that I already have your results, isn't it?
12/01/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: If you are accepted into the program then you proceed ahead with Enrollment.
12/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: You must have gone through where I shared regarding Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission.
12/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 360 0968: I know but my family would also like to know the guarantee of the refund if not admitted ..my parents wont be the ones paying for the application but the family
12/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 360 0968: I went through that dear that is why l asked what happens if l dont get admission you were the one who told me there's a refund thats why l asked ,on what grounds of assurance is the refund. Cause if a guarantee of admission was the case you should have stated that when l asked what happens when l dont get admission we wouldnt be here in the first place <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Like I briefed you if Edoofa fails to provide you an admission your fee is refunded, Thokozani.

Now considering you already have your results with you, your would be provided an acceptance letter from Edoofa, after the same you pay the enrollment fee.
12/01/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: We do provide guarantee of admission itself,

Why would you receive an acceptance letter if your documents would not already be evaluated?

You would be going through thorough interview and test,

Whereby if found eligible, then only you proceed.

Admission is guaranteed.
12/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 360 0968: I get all that ...my concern is what assurance do l have for the refund if lm to be accepted..
Should l just put my trust in your word that they'll be a refund or theres something solidarity to that.
12/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 360 0968: And again why is there an option of refund if lm eligible to admission guarantee
12/01/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Thokozani, are you thoroughly following what I am sharing?
12/01/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: *If Edoofa fails to provide you an admission then the fee is refunded.*

*Guarantee of admission is on the basis of your results and academic performance.*
12/01/24, 1:07 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Im not sure you get me as well but then lets proceed
12/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk
12/01/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Since you already have enough gap in your education and your results are with you,

Your documents would be evaluated well in advance.

You would receive an acceptance letter only if you qualify.

There are no chances of you not receiving an admission.
12/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Ok
12/01/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: You are confusing two different things together.

I hope you understood that refunds are processed if we as an organisation fail to provide you an admission. 

You donot have any role ina that.
12/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Ok
12/01/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: However guarantee of admission is related to your academic results which will be processed first.
12/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Ok
12/01/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Do you have any queries for me?

Feel free to share so that you have no doubts left.
12/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Proceed please
12/01/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to connect with your friend Abigail?

I believe you must be aware she is already in India!
12/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Yes she did say
12/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Do connect her with your father or relatives if they require a better understanding from a student itself.
12/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk
12/01/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: I would like to add to your understanding in a rather simplified manner,

Students start with their higher education with Edoofa while they are still in their Upper 6.

While this happens, if they donot meet the mandatory requirement, there fee is refunded in the later stage.

Now your case being completed different, as we wouldn't have proceeded ahead with your application itself if you wouldn't qualify on the basis of your results!
12/01/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: I believe you must recall I submitted your results for evaluation earlier?
12/01/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Now as your results do qualify for the requirements of your desired course,

Admission is guaranteed.
12/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk
12/01/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Now do you have a better understanding?
12/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk l hear you
12/01/24, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: I believe your concern is addressed now?
12/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Yes
12/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Great,

Do you have any queries for me?
12/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 360 0968: No proceed please
12/01/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/01/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/01/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk will do
12/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/01/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: Dear Thokozani and parents,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “13-01-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
