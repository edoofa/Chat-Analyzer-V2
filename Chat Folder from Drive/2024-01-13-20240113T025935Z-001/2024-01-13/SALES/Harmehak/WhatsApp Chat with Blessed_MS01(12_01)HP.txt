12/01/24, 4:53 pm - +263 77 531 5942: My name is Blessed Ingwani. I was born on 10 February 2005 and I'm 18 now. I live in a small village called Makwaha. My father is a teacher and my mother is an agricultural extension officer. My parents know the importance of education and they give in whatever they have to make sure that we go to school but up to a certain limit. I attended my primary school at Mafumise primary school and I scored 10 units. I then attended High School at Mt Selinda High and I managed to get 4As and 6Bs doing pure sciences. I came back to Mt Selinda High again to do my A level because it was the one which my parents could afford. I was doing Mathematics Physics and Chemistry. I downloaded the results and I found out that I got 14 points. 
I want to do electrical and electronic engineering and our duty as engineers is to solve problems. That's where my big dream is. I am a man who's good at team work, reading, hard working, creative and I'm a person who strives to be a better somebody in the future. I am a good at socialism. 
My favorite hobby is playing darts and chess since they are smart games and they improve mental calculation and thinking capacity. I managed to go to the national darts championship and I can in position 4
