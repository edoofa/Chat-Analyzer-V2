We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

09/01/24, 3:28 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Alright...understood thank you
09/01/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
09/01/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
09/01/24, 3:34 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Yes it's true that's part of the reasons as well...also considering the high expenses of the country's fees per month/term involving accommodation and food
09/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Also got the knowledge of India's ability to accommodate all races and the affordable fees which is very much less compared to that of Zimbabwe
09/01/24, 3:39 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Not forgetting the high quality education that is provided by Edoofa
09/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Sidumisile.
09/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Sidumisile, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

10/01/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: I am doing well
10/01/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Well Sidumisile now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
10/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 327 9185: Yes.....I think studying abroad is a life changing decision wereby you get to have experience in intertwining and living with different people of various races not forgetting the fact that it gives opportunities in learning different cultures,practices and religion also involving the idea of having to co exist as peers and learn different things from each other as you will be coming from different places
10/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: That's well put across, Sidumisile.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
10/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 77 327 9185: I think higher education abroad also helps in a person's maturity level..when we study here near our  parents the spirit of dependancy doesn't leave our site hence by starting a life abroad it gives courage and helps our minds sink in to the idea that we are grown and that is one of the important things that we as teenagers need to register in our minds....hence Yes I am mentally prepared to start a life abroad
10/01/24, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Sidumisile, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
10/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 77 327 9185: Yes thank you

Every family member from my family knows about this decision that I have made and they are fully supportive about this and all praying and willing I get this opportunity as they know this to be one of my dreams since I started my O level...they are indeed willing to support my higher education both mentally and financially
10/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: I appreciate their thorough support, Sidumisile.
10/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
10/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 77 327 9185: Yes I am confident ma'am and I'm sure I attained the required standard to be enrolled by Edoofa
10/01/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful
10/01/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: Sidumisile, are you aware that Edoofa has many students enrolled from Matopo high school as well as Sacred high who are currently in India and would be traveling this year as well?
10/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 327 9185: Yes ma'am I am aware of that
10/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: That's great
10/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Babongile Phiri, Nikala Sharon, Tinashe Chitungo are one of those who joined in the past week itself.
10/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 327 9185: Ok ma'am I know them very well thank you very much
10/01/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: That's great, Sidumisile!
10/01/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Law ?
10/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 327 9185: Ok
10/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 77 327 9185: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Received please
10/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 327 9185: What motivates me to study law is my desire to fight for justice which is proven by my ability to speak up against injustice taking place....ever since I was a child I desired watching shows that included forensics,partenity court and I've also watched some Indian shows that included Jolly LLB which have also triggered the desire to study law in the years I have become fond of such
10/01/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Oh that's definitely well thought off, Sidumisile.

I can see you have an aspiration to do well for others and I appreciate your noble thoughts.

On that note, let me brief you about your desired course.

10/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 327 9185: No we are not familiar with that ma'am
10/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Alright please
10/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
10/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
10/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

10/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Yes please?
10/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 78 402 3619: 🇧🇲🇧🇲
10/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Ohh ok noted....thank you ma'am
10/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same, Sidumisile?
10/01/24, 12:06 pm - +263 77 327 9185: That's very nice and thoughtful of you and I think the prices are affordable considering the fact that the accommodation and food is included
10/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
10/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Sidumisile, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
10/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Yes it is true and considering the fact that you cannot eat sadza and curry everyday hence you have to change and that's slightly higher than sadza
10/01/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct!

I believe now you are in an even better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Sidumisile?
10/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Yes tts true I am
10/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
10/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
10/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
10/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

10/01/24, 12:43 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Well understood thank you....good program to hold on to
10/01/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Sidumisile!
10/01/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Ok ma'am woow I think that's interesting......it's all good
10/01/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
10/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 77 327 9185: 😊
10/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

10/01/24, 1:34 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Ooh these are nice efforts coming from the students
10/01/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Sidumisile
10/01/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
10/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Yes I am ready ma'am
10/01/24, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: Sidumisile, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
10/01/24, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
10/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 327 9185: $1500-$2150
10/01/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
10/01/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
10/01/24, 1:50 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Ohhh ok understood ma'am
10/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
10/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Yes..those are necessary procedures to follow ma'am
10/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
10/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
10/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
10/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Ok understood ma'am
10/01/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
10/01/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
10/01/24, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
10/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Yes I did understand
10/01/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
10/01/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
10/01/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
10/01/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 2:14 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Ok ma'am all okay
10/01/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: As of now, do you have any queries for me, Sidumisile?
10/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 77 327 9185: No ma'am it's all clear to me
10/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: I am glad.
10/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
10/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
10/01/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Ok thank guy very much ma'am I will speak with her
10/01/24, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, do connect your parents as well
10/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Ok I will
10/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 77 327 9185: I have received information from her thank you ma'am
10/01/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
10/01/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
10/01/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
10/01/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

10/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Ok thank you
10/01/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
11/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 327 9185: Good morning
11/01/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Sidumisile and dear parents, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
11/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 77 327 9185: Yes we did have a good discussion Thank you

We may proceed
11/01/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: That's great,

So far do you have any queries for me? <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 11:35 am - +263 77 327 9185: No we don't 

We had a smooth conversation
11/01/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: I am glad.
11/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 327 9185: Yes please
11/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
11/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 77 327 9185: Yes we did connect...she did mention that it was a life changing decision for her and her family and she didn't think that  Edoofa could reach  such levels or heights in order to help her
11/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 327 9185: She also mentioned the fact that without Edoofa she wouldn't be were she is now it has played a big role in her and her daughter's life
11/01/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: I appreciate and I am glad you could have a discussion with her.
11/01/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

11/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful, so Sidumisile, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
11/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Thank you ma'am

11/01/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Yes please

11/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Yes they are....we did agree on the same
11/01/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Could you please request them to acknowledge the same using a voice note, Sidumisile?
11/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Ok ma'am
11/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
11/01/24, 12:32 pm - +263 78 402 3619: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I have received your acknowledgement and I appreciate your support for Sidumisile!
11/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
11/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
11/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 327 9185: Ok ma'am understood
11/01/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th January 2024 for $200 and the  17th or 18th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
