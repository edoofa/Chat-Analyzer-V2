10/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: I am doing well
10/01/24, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Well received, Beulla, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
10/01/24, 9:49 am - +263 71 856 6245: Oky well said l now clearly understand Ms. Harmehak
10/01/24, 9:53 am - Harmehak: That's great
10/01/24, 9:53 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 71 856 6245: Yes l heard they are projects which we will be doing so that they cover our fee and help us reduce the burden of fees
10/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 71 856 6245: And that's very interesting.. being self reliable
10/01/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: That's great
10/01/24, 10:02 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Beulla, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Nkululeko high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
10/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 71 856 6245: Oky as you know my name Beulla Mashiri a girl aged 18 who recently finished her A level ..l learnt at Nkululeko from grade 6 upto upper 6 the fees where rapidly changing but my last term at Nkululeko the fees was 415USD...l was a commercial student doing Accounting, Business Studies and Computer Science ....about sports activities l used to play tennis during my primary level but when l went to high school there was no tennis so l opted for netball but not for too long though l only played netball when l was in form one...l have both parents alive my father is a bus driver and my mother is a teacher...l'm the second born and we are 6 in my family...we are two girls in my family and my little sister is doing her form 1 at Nkululeko that's where they enrolled her because my father was pleased with my  results l wrote Business Studies in June and got an A... l guess that's all
10/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 71 856 6245: I stay in Tokwe 4 with my mother and my younger siblings
10/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 71 856 6245: I wish to study Accounting
10/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 71 856 6245: I was very good at Business studies though l loved accounts..accounts is a bit difficult subject but with passion , the love l have for it and also my dream to be an accountant l worked hard and l'm hoping for best results
10/01/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Beulla, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

I am delighted to see your fondness for Subjects like Business and accounting <This message was edited>
10/01/24, 10:48 am - +263 71 856 6245: Oky thank you Ms. Harmehak
10/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: You're welcome
10/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Well Beulla now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
10/01/24, 11:08 am - +263 71 856 6245: Yess l believe so .....Education abroad is a life changing style because once l finish university l can easily get a job and also with the help of Edoofa of course as you will be with us as our mentor up until we get a job unlike  here in Zimbabwe l can finish university and spent many years looking for a job because of the current situation of job scarcity even to the educated people who have degrees
10/01/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: You see, Beulla, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
10/01/24, 11:24 am - +263 71 856 6245: I'm advising my fellow people to  put more affort in there studies and work hard to get scholarships and study abroad
10/01/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
10/01/24, 11:27 am - Harmehak: Beulla, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
10/01/24, 11:33 am - +263 71 856 6245: Yes they are supporting me..... my mother is currently not online but she's aware of this and she's 100% supporting me and encouraging me to put more effort to get this scholarship
10/01/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Duly noted, Beulla.

I do appreciate her support.
10/01/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
10/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 71 856 6245: Yes l am because l'm aiming more than 10 points on my overall studies
10/01/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful
10/01/24, 11:46 am - Harmehak: Beulla, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Accounting ?
10/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 275 3262: How are you Ms. Harmehak as Beulla's father l'm pleased with the performance of my child and l'm highly supporting her in the participation of the scholarship program
10/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 71 856 6245: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Mr Mashiri.
10/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Received please
10/01/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: I await the remaining responses.
10/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 71 856 6245: By the time l was doing Olevel there was scarcity of commercial teachers at my school but l managed to get a C in accounts because l had passion in accounts ....it was always my dream to be an accountant so what motivates me is that in a real life situation self employed is the talk of sustainability here in Zimbabwe
10/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Beulla.

I do understand what you a surely and appreciate your efforts as well.
10/01/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: So for the same, you would be pursuing Bachelors of Commerce - Honors in Accounting!

Now shall I brief you about your desired course?
10/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 71 856 6245: Okay please l'm waiting

I await your response.
10/01/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 856 6245: Oky Ms. Harmehak as you said we will be attending to projects, l don't really know what kind of projects in detail but from my own understanding from what Isheanesu told me these projects would help me improve my communication skills ,self branding skills , help me boost my confidence and also be creative...As l will be doing these projects l will learn valuable life skills that would benefit me personally and professionally and in the near future l will be able to build something for my self and be a good leader
10/01/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Beulla, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
10/01/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation
10/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 71 856 6245: As l mentioned ....seems as if education in Zimbabwe is loosing value even if u go to university and graduate you can spent your whole life roaming around looking for a job to fail because of corruption as those who are only well connected are the ones who are succeeding sidelining many graduates so l want to try education abroad because people from abroad value their education and also since Edoofa will be with me through the all walks of life so as to raise my standard of living and change home
10/01/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: Indeed we understand the situation there.
10/01/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: However I am equally glad that you are making efforts for a promising future, Beulla.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

10/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 71 856 6245: Sorry Ms. Harmehak my network is really bad
10/01/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: I understand
10/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Beulla.

10/01/24, 3:59 pm - +263 71 856 6245: India offers quality education to all students from the four corners of the world it does not illtreat foreigners like other countries do

11/01/24, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
11/01/24, 9:09 am - +263 71 856 6245: I'm oky how are today Ms. Harmehak  ....yes we shall
11/01/24, 9:15 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please!
11/01/24, 9:15 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
11/01/24, 9:23 am - +263 71 856 6245: Noo we haven't yet heard of the fee without a scholarship ....please share
11/01/24, 9:25 am - Harmehak: Sure please
11/01/24, 9:25 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/01/24, 9:25 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/01/24, 9:25 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/01/24, 9:25 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 71 856 6245: If l happen to get a scholarship l can manage because the salary of civil servants here in Zimbabwe are very low
11/01/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: I do understand please
11/01/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: In simple words Beulla, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/01/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
11/01/24, 9:44 am - +263 71 856 6245: So how many points are you expecting for me to qualify
11/01/24, 9:46 am - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
11/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 71 856 6245: It's oky l'm sure l will make it
11/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: That's great!
11/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Beulla, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
11/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 71 856 6245: Yes that's very true Ms. Harmehak life in Zimbabwe is very expensive and not all the people can afford to go to universities even though after completing the university level you will end up going back to the streets because of job scarcity which is painful
11/01/24, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Yes please, I do understand.

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Beulla?
11/01/24, 10:04 am - +263 71 856 6245: Yes it's very much affordable as you said l can access earn while you learn program it will also reduce burden for my parents since they will be able to focus on my siblings who needs financial support
11/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
11/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
11/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

11/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: I can understand.
11/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 71 856 6245: I'm prepared to put maximum effort throughout the projects
11/01/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: That's great
11/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

I shall appreciate your active participation. <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 71 856 6245: I can see transparency in your programs
11/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 71 856 6245: I hope l'm going to enjoy every minute of your sessions
11/01/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!

I hope you are aware of Isheanesu is currently under the Earn While You Learn Program too!
11/01/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: You definitely will, Beulla.
11/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 71 856 6245: Yes he told me about it but l'm hoping to deeply understand through our conversation
11/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 71 856 6245: He just highlighted but l would want to know much so l will get in touch with him
11/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: That's great!
11/01/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: I will be connecting you and your parent with a parent associated with Edoofa too by the end of our conversation!
11/01/24, 11:57 am - +263 71 856 6245: Thank you Ms. Harmehak
11/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
11/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: You're welcome
11/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 71 856 6245: My parents are always busy especially my father so you might think that they are ignorant but that's not the case
11/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 71 856 6245: Yes ..I'm ready
11/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.

I appreciate you informing me the same.
11/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 71 856 6245: Thank you for understanding Ms. Harmehak
11/01/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Beulla, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
11/01/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 71 856 6245: I'm sorry to ask ...what do you mean by statement of purpose
11/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
11/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: The admissions team will assist you with the same.
11/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 71 856 6245: Oky Ms. Harmehak when are you expecting the SOP
11/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: The admissions team will inform you.
11/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Please!
11/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 71 856 6245: Oky l understand the process
11/01/24, 12:18 pm - +263 71 856 6245: So when are you expecting the admission fee
11/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: This is the amount that students spend without Edoofa!
11/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: How much is the same?
11/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 71 856 6245: I'm not getting you well
11/01/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Did you properly read the entire message?
11/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 71 856 6245: I understand that l have to go through all these processes when applying to study abroad so when are you expecting the application fee
11/01/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Beulla, this the case for students who apply by themselves without Edoofa.

They spend around $1500-2250 just on the application fee with no guarantee of admission!

I hope you are clear with the same please?
11/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 71 856 6245: Oky now l understand Ms. Harmehak
11/01/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/01/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
11/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 71 856 6245: I'm fully prepared to be part of Edoofa so when are you expecting me to pay that $350
11/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: After you qualify for the program, Beulla;
11/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 856 6245: Oky l understand
11/01/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/01/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
11/01/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/01/24, 12:54 pm - +263 71 856 6245: Very much  impressing
11/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
11/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
11/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
11/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/01/24, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
11/01/24, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the discussion, Beulla?
11/01/24, 7:31 pm - +263 71 856 6245: Yes l did.... I'm sorry for late replies Ms. Harmehak my whatsapp bundle finished and there was no airtime at the nearby shop so l had to find someone to sent me airtime
11/01/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Beulla!
11/01/24, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/01/24, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
11/01/24, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
11/01/24, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
11/01/24, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

11/01/24, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: That's great
11/01/24, 8:50 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth!
11/01/24, 9:08 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
11/01/24, 9:08 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
11/01/24, 9:08 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/01/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth?

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
12/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 71 856 6245: I had no bundle yesterday but l'm planning to connect with her today but l admired she was able to handle the situation even though she is a small scale farmer and l was impressed that Edoofa helped her and k wish it will happen the same with me

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
