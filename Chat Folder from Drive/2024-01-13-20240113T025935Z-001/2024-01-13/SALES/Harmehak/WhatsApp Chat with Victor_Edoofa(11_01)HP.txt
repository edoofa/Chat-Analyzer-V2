12/01/24, 9:44 am - +263 77 347 3826: Yeah
12/01/24, 9:48 am - Harmehak: Meanwhile, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 9:48 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
12/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 77 347 3826: Your response is very slow. Not sure if I will have all the time to wait for too long holding on to the phone just to receive a text
12/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 77 347 3826: Just noticed it's my data that depleted. Pardon me. Will be back online soon
12/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: I believe you are facing network challenges, Mr Kennedy.
12/01/24, 10:06 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please.

I do understand.
12/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 347 3826: I am back. Please go ahead
12/01/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: I hope you were able to learn more about the Edoofa Program?
12/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 347 3826: Yes I did
12/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 347 3826: Sounds good to me
12/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!

So now as we proceed ahead, I would like to know Victor better as a student.

How he is at school, his interests and hobbies.

I can see he wishes to study Engineering, if you can shed some light on the same too!
12/01/24, 10:15 am - +263 77 347 3826: Victor is an intelligent  child and has done well in his O levels examinations. We wish him well in his A levels too. He is an active Christian and plays keyboard  at church. He is the second child in a family of four. Generally a well behaved person with high moral standards. His dream is to study software engineering or anything related to aviation engineering. He is currently studying Physics Maths and Computer Science at A level. He is generally doing well in all the subjects and seem to be promising.
12/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: That's great Mr Kennedy.

It's a pleasure to know about him,

He definitely seems to be a dedicated student who wishes to prosper in the fields Engineering.
12/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 347 3826: Okay
12/01/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: Mr Kennedy as per Victor's interests and subject combination, he qualifies for BTech Computer Science Engineering which is the degree for Software Engineering itself.

Following would be the description for the same.

Meanwhile Chemistry is a mandatory requirement for Aviation Engineering.
12/01/24, 10:29 am - Harmehak: *B.Tech. Computer Science Engineering* is an engineering undergraduate course in computer sciences

12/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 347 3826: Interesting
12/01/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: I appreciate,

So Mr Kennedy, Now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
12/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 347 3826: I am sure Victor will meet the minimum requirements  to be considered  for scholarship  to study *B.Tech. Computer Science*
12/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 347 3826: Sure.
12/01/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your trust and we do look forward to the same.

12/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 77 347 3826: I am convinced
12/01/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Mr Kennedy.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 347 3826: No, I am not familiar
12/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: I do understand
12/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 347 3826: Okay
12/01/24, 10:57 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
12/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 347 3826: I think the offer is good.
12/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 347 3826: I wanted to ask though is the 2k to 3k is a one off payment or it can be paid in instalment  through the year?
12/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 347 3826: Also who chooses what university a student should go to? Edoofa or Parent student?
12/01/24, 11:06 am - Harmehak: Let me provide you a better clarity.
12/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Now you see Mr Kennedy, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
12/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 347 3826: That is clear
12/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 77 347 3826: So for your potential students what is required of them to qualify other than wait for their A level results?
12/01/24, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Once Victor is accepted into the program.

You would proceed with the admissions stage where the Admissions team would get in touch.

Now, you would receive various acceptance letters from different universities.

After the same you would decide which university you would like to opt for.
12/01/24, 11:10 am - +263 77 347 3826: Okay
12/01/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: From the student's end their academics are important.

Later in the stage Victor would be appearing a test as well as going through an interview with the Program Director for eligibility check.
12/01/24, 11:11 am - +263 77 347 3826: That is clear
12/01/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 347 3826: Hope you keep the parent in the loop with this too
12/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 347 3826: Does Edoofa also offer flight expenses for its students?
12/01/24, 11:18 am - Harmehak: Yes please,

You would be proceeding for a video call interview with the Program Director.
12/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 77 347 3826: When?
12/01/24, 11:26 am - ~ Pastor Ken added +263 71 541 9773
12/01/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: After we complete the counseling session you would have a better clarity please.
12/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 77 347 3826: Noted
12/01/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$450, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations
12/01/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 347 3826: Noted
12/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
12/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/01/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Okay
12/01/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Makes sense
12/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/01/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Sure
12/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries, Mr Kennedy?
12/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 77 347 3826: When is Victor supposed to start EWLP and how much time would this demand on his already busy schedule? Would the work add value to his computer studies or it may negatively impact his results?
12/01/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Mr Kennedy, Victor would be alloted a dedicated mentor who would assist him while he is still in Zimbabwe.

The projects and schedule are made accordingly to not impact his studies meanwhile help him earn credits.

As soon as he is found eligible for the program and accepted, he would begin with his EWYL.
12/01/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
12/01/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected so far, Mr Kennedy?
12/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Noted. Still connected
12/01/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Yaah go ahead
12/01/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Mr Kennedy, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/01/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Quite a lot
12/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Okay
12/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Mr Kennedy, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 77 347 3826: $350 is still a lot for an application fee. In Zimbabwe a university  application will.cost $50 at most
12/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Edoofa application fee is a little on the high even though I ca  make a plan
12/01/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: While I understand please,

International education is different please.
12/01/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* 

It's not just application fee please.
12/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 347 3826: I get you but that could also be a great challenge for most parents
12/01/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Can you share your website with me please
12/01/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: While we do understand please,

Basically this is the reason itself that we proceed with admission in advance, so that parents can prepare.
12/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Is that paid as a one off payment or it also be staggered  over some months
12/01/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/01/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 347 3826: I am not in a position to pay that kind of money right now until May 2024
12/01/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: edoofa.com
12/01/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Mr Kennedy, I hope you followed the discussion that it's paid after Victor is found eligible for the program and in parts?
12/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 347 3826: My son TJ is on another scholarship with Higher Life and it covers his tuition at any local university  in Zimbabwe. I had developed interest in your programme  until you mentioned this application  fee which is beyond me
12/01/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Mr Kennedy I hope you understand it's not just application fee.

*The enrollment fee of $350 includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* 

Its paid after Victor is found eligible for the program and the fee is paid in parts.
12/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 77 347 3826: I hear you
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/01/24, 2:11 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Yes I understand
12/01/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
12/01/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Okay
12/01/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/01/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/01/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Thank you
12/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 347 3826: After chatting to Mrs Ruth Magwaza I have confidence in the Edoofa programme, however the question that I have is are there no chances that the fees required to be paid by the parents end up going beyond the 2000 margins you used to advertise  yourselves?
12/01/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate your question regarding the fee of $2000

Or you can rephrase the same?
12/01/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 347 3826: You indicated that the scholarships may leave tuition fees to be paid by parents somewhere between 1000 and 2000 dollars a year. My question is: Are there instances where fees to be paid by parents go beyond the maximum $2000 you mentioned at the beginning of our conversation?
12/01/24, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: Mr Kennedy the fee after the scholarship is between $2000-3000

However it's not just tuition fee please.

The costs include tuition fee, accomodation, food along with Basic university expenses like Library, Gym, Laundry and Wifi.
12/01/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: The same can be further reduced through the Earn While You Learn Program as we discussed earlier.
12/01/24, 3:38 pm - +263 77 347 3826: I hear you
12/01/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Mr Kennedy.
12/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 77 347 3826: I suppose I will be in a position  to make a decision after I know how much scholarship my son will get. I don't really have a reason to struggle so much when he already has another scholarship  that covers his tuition here
12/01/24, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: Mr Kennedy, do you believe that studying abroad and in Zimbabwe,

There's a difference in the education and the exposure, isn't it?
12/01/24, 3:53 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Well it all depends. At the moment studying abroad could give my son a better exposure but that does not mean universities around are not good enough. I suppose we will weigh the pros and cons of this decision and decide for Victor
12/01/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand your concerns as a patent.
12/01/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: You see, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.
12/01/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: What is your take on the same?
12/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 77 347 3826: Like I said we will weigh the pros and cons and make a decision. Let's give this until end of January
12/01/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: Let me provide you with the resources for a family discussion,

Do connect with Victor too as he was thoroughly informed by his friend Abigail regarding the details, who is currently a part of the program and in India.
12/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
12/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.
12/01/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Also have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.
