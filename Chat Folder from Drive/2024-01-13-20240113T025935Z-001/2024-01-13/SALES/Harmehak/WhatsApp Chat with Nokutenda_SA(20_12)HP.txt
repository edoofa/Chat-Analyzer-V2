20/12/23, 10:35 pm - +263 71 888 1216: Hello Ms Harmehak

I am using my mother's phone right now 
Mine is off @263713320964

Anyways l am a young man
English and Shona are languages um comfortable using
I do not have a criminal record
I love learning about  new things...it keep me going ,knowing that they is more to the world than most people see it,and learning how things work
And for this reason that's why l would love to do engineering...it's a field filled will amaizing tech..etc.
Unlike most fields it's not limited
It goes beyond and even beyond our world and deeper into outer space

As for my Education
Right now l just finished writing A level and waiting for my results

But l won't lie 
My A level journey was not an easy one...
I was always behind..I had to work twice as much to keep up with others...
The combination l was doing was Maths 
Physics and Chem

And Maths was my best subject followed with Physics and lastly Chem..
I did find chemistry to be difficult for me because even if l read it, still l would fail to grasp the concepts and when l did grasp them the questions came in another format....
My weakness is l find it hard interacting with people very much...
It's as if l am an extrovert 


I do wish to study Engineering... l love it and they is no better way of making money than with what you love doing..

As for my hobbies l enjoy internet surfing and dancing


I don't come from a wealthy family...we do what we have to,to get by..
We are a family of 5 my me, mother, father and two siblings both girls

My mother is a stay at home mom
And my father works as a lab technician at a local company..

As for my siblings they are both still at school
One in high school the other in primary school
21/12/23, 9:06 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Saturday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/12/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 888 1216: We can go ahead we have network prob and electricity problem, so bear with us dear
21/12/23, 10:55 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Hello Mrs Harmehak
@919871782922 

I know my participation is most important for me to be able to get the scholarship especially with the tight competition

Unfortunately due to network issues,l sometimes fail to be online 
Which l know will impact my chances of getting it

Also they is an issue with time especially the early hours of the day..
I happened to be chosen by a company recently due to my performance as far as their work is required and they hired me
So during the day l will be working and around 21:00 C.A.T l knock off
They said after the festive season the times will be better and instead of 21:00 will knock off at 15:00 C.A.T
The reason l am working right now is so l can find money to help me with any educational stuff which might be needed as l go on
So l won't be left out .

I am really sorry but earlier hours of the day are very challenging for me..
If possible
I ask you help me by rescheduling to late hours of the day..
If you're not comfortable it's alright
I will see what l can do
Because l really need this
23/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

26/12/23, 10:09 am - Harmehak: Well Nokutenda now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
26/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 71 332 0964: Is it oky if l send an audio
26/12/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Yes please
26/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: You see, Nokutenda, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
26/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: It's great to see that you are looking at maximum exposure along with quality education, Nokutenda.
26/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 332 0964: And yes l do believe it's a life changing decision 

And l would want to change my life for the better...
And be able to live a mark on the world 
That l was here and did something worthwhile and something that can change the world's view
26/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 71 332 0964: They was this other girl who recently also finished University and got a degree 
She came to my work place and asked if l can put in good word for her to become a Till operator but her qualifications make her a lawyer at best...but she told me she can't find that opportunity and said her degree was not working
26/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I completely understand and I am equally glad that you do have a fair judgement of things you realise the opportunity you have currently.
26/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: Nokutenda, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
26/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 332 0964: They will certainly do there best
26/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 332 0964: Their *
26/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 332 0964: They actually got me a passport this year for that very reason so..that if l ever get the opportunity
I would have somewhere to start from
26/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: I do understand, Nokutenda.

So can you please elaborate regarding your understanding of the financial aspect of the program and how would you be assisted please?
26/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: That's great
26/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 332 0964: I understand the scholarship can be full or half..

Therefore it now comes to which l might get

If l get full...then that would be lovely
If l get half
I would want to know the prices of the remaining fees so that l can share with my family and see if they can be able to afford for me
26/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 71 332 0964: Or if we can come up with a plan 
Financial or seek financial aid from other sources
26/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a full scholarship?
26/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 71 332 0964: I think it covers the fees 
Then as for living and housing one pays for himself...

Is this correct 🤷🏽‍♂️
26/12/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.

Yes please.
26/12/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
26/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 332 0964: Yes l am confident
Even if l didn't perform my best l know l did well nevertheless....

I really hope l get passes which increase my chances for a scholarship
26/12/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful
26/12/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Engineering ?
26/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 332 0964: I love working with technology...
I find it interesting knowing how something  complicated is made. 
And the thought of me making something on my own which can help and make work easier for someone will make me feel good about myself...
26/12/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Received please
26/12/23, 11:38 am - Harmehak: That wonderful and well thought off, Nokutenda.

So what all did you research regarding your desired field?
26/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 71 332 0964: I have been researching since form 4
I want to do something like software engineering or electrical engineering
26/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: That's great,

So which out of two are you more inclined towards, Nokutenda?
26/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 71 332 0964: Software engineering
26/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 332 0964: But if l was to list 
What l want to do

Since you do have inclination towards Medical sector, may I know why you didn't pursue Biology in your A level?
26/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Well Nokutenda considering Biology is all about Human and living beings and so is medicine!

It's important to study Biology.
26/12/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
26/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Ohh l see
26/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Let me see if l can do anything and get back to you
26/12/23, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please, 

Can you elaborate?
26/12/23, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 332 0964: I have no interest in any of these😪
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 332 0964: It's okay l understand
26/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Oky let me send vn
26/12/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Nokutenda, did you ever happen to research about the cost and requirements of Medicine in Zimbabwe too?

15 points in A level being one of them?
26/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Voice note
26/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Yes l did research
26/12/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: So what is your take on the same considering how you expressed earlier, 

I can see you are well aware and medicine wasn't your initial inclination too?
26/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 332 0964: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand, Nokutenda.

Considering you initially applied for engineering itself and as per our initial discussion you were inclined towards Engineering too.

Can you please help me understand better the reason behind sudden inclination towards medicine so that I am in a better position to assist?
26/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: I am here to assist you.
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Well if l can do medicine
Then l have no choice but to do engineering
If only l knew l would have also done biology making my A level subjects 4 
But l never knew
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 332 0964: When l was in primary l wanted to be a doctor...
It was my first prefered profession..so l just thought l would go with that
So l researched it's cons
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 332 0964: If l can only do engineering
Can l do electricity engineering instead of software engineering
26/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Also l know it might not be what you do
But can you tell me Three Engineering programs which guarantee my success and those that are less likely to be replaced by Ai
26/12/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Received and I do understand please.
26/12/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand your challenges.
26/12/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Considering both your interests are great choices along with Mechanical and Civil Engineering, Nokutenda.
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Mmm nice
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 332 0964: So l will go with electrical and mechanical as my second preference
26/12/23, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

Electrical engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism for the development and maintenance of electrical and electronics equipment.

26/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Yeah yeah 
I am interested
26/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 332 0964: I do find the Electrical part of physics fine and understandable and nice
26/12/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Nokutenda 

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
26/12/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 332 0964: P

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
28/12/23, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
28/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 332 0964: Yes we may start
28/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your knowledge
28/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
28/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 332 0964: Thank you
28/12/23, 10:23 am - Harmehak: Please?
28/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 332 0964: No 
But we heard it's quite costy so without scholarship it might be too expensive for us
28/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Alright please
28/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 10:24 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 332 0964: Wow 
Those are really high prices
28/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 332 0964: This makes things a bit easier easier
28/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 332 0964: What is the earn while you learn program about and how it can reduce my fees a bit too

Is it part of Edoofa
28/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Yes please, Nokutenda
28/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 332 0964: Interesting 🤔
28/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 332 0964: I believe l now know what Edoofa is about and what it's doing.
28/12/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
28/12/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: I am glad please.
28/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 71 332 0964: Well this is very great..
A lot of underprivileged young people who are brilliant can now be able to make something of themselves due to this program which enables them to also stand out despite their past and where they come from...
28/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 71 332 0964: I would very much want an opportunity like this..
It's not everyday it comes by
28/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your thorough understanding and acknowledgement for the offered assistance!
28/12/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: Nokutenda, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
28/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 71 332 0964: I would
And even after spending this much in Zimbabwe the job opportunities will be very scares..
Not even there
28/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: That's correct, Nokutenda and I am glad to see your efforts for a promising future!

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail.
28/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

28/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 332 0964: Being able to learn skills which will help you in life
Will most definitely give students an advantage over most people

Um am interested
It also helps with social skills ..nice
28/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Nokutenda!
28/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 332 0964: 😅yes please
28/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

I really want all this..
What should l do to be under Edoofa's program..
The steps l should make to guarantee me
28/12/23, 11:15 am - Harmehak: I am Ms Harmehak
28/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 332 0964: So very sorry
Forgive me
28/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 332 0964: Ms Harmehak
28/12/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: I understand
28/12/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: I will brief you about the remaining process now.
28/12/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
28/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 332 0964: Oky thank you
28/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 332 0964: Ms Harmehak
Can we reschedule for Sunday 
Right now I am about to start work
And Sunday l am on off
28/12/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: We are going to conclude the session itself, Nokutenda!
28/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 332 0964: Ohh oky l see
28/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 332 0964: In that case Ms Harmehak l would like to continue
I just alerted my Supervisor what's happening
28/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: I do understand please
28/12/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Nokutenda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
28/12/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 332 0964: 2000 to 2250
28/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 71 332 0964: I see
So l should apply for university first then for the scholarship later
28/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
28/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: This is for the students who apply without Edoofa.
28/12/23, 11:38 am - Harmehak: You see Nokutenda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 71 332 0964: So then Edoofa will do everything for me
28/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the same as well please?
28/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 332 0964: I see
It's nice
28/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
28/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 332 0964: So due date is 31 January
28/12/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: It's paid after/if you are found eligible and you receive an acceptance letter, please.
28/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 71 332 0964: Oky oky l see
28/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 332 0964: Right now my parents are offline
When they come online they will give you feedback
But l myself am interested
28/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
28/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
28/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
28/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
28/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 71 332 0964: Oky
28/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 332 0964: Lovely
28/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 71 332 0964: The only part l don't understand is the interview part..
Will it be on Skype or typing as we are now
Or l have to visit an Edoofa office if they is one in Zimbabwe
28/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: The video call interview is done with the parent.

The technical round with the student is done using a voice note in their interview group.

We donot have office in Zimbabwe, we have associates all over Zimbabwe and we are connected with school as discussed earlier, Smit Academy being one them!
28/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Okay thank you l understand fully now
28/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
28/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
28/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
28/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 332 0964: So after this I will be added to another group to finish
28/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: A separate interview group will be created please.
28/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Oky oky and this fee is paid separately from the Edoofa fee 
Am l right
28/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Nice
28/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Oky thank you
28/12/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: For Edoofians, its a part of their first year's tuition fee and not a separate fee.
28/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Lovely...
Edoofa really makes everything simple
28/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
28/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
28/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

Let me contact her 
And get first hand information
28/12/23, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well, Nokutenda?
28/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Loading
28/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
28/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 332 0964: My last question Ms Harmehak

If l get the scholarship and everything is good 
Persay 3 years after the line and l am left with one year and l can't pay my remaining fees..
Then it's over or something will be drawn up🤷🏽‍♂️
28/12/23, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate your query in terms of the challenges that you might face in not being able to pay the tuition fee, Nokutenda?
28/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Maybe the one providing money maybe involved in an accident and will no longer be able to do so
28/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand Nokutenda,

I believe you did understand that the Earn While You Learn Program is there to assist you?

If Persistence has been able to earn more $4000, don't you believe you can do the same as well?
28/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Anymore
28/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Can you elaborate?
28/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 332 0964: I believe
Oky thank you
28/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: That's great
28/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Now do you have any queries please?
28/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Network is a big problem here
28/12/23, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
28/12/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
28/12/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

29/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 332 0964: 2: India

02/01/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 71 375 2896: That's a better plan which ease pressure on me..so just waiting to hear if he qualifies then see how I will go about the fees in accordance with your payment plan

Kindly participate in the interview group.
02/01/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: How was the interview, Mr Norman?
03/01/24, 8:37 am - +263 71 375 2896: They was off nterruption of internet now and then,.In terms of scholarship am I supposed to be paying $200 monthly as I am made to understand that scholarships are for those unable to fund fully their education.,and was supposed to pay $350 then I would then be eligible for my son's education...
03/01/24, 9:03 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

Let me help you understand better!

Shall we start?
03/01/24, 9:03 am - Harmehak: No please
03/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected Mr Norman?
03/01/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Yes , please
03/01/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Mr Norman, $350 is paid after Nokutenda is found eligible for the program and receives an acceptance letter.

It can be paid in installments of $200 in January and $150 in February.
03/01/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: *You are not supposed to be paying $200 monthly.*
03/01/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: *The enrollment fee of $350 includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 71 375 2896: You have now explained better.. after having qualified for a scholarship then will it be the scholarship taking care of his education and welfare..
03/01/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

I hope you followed the entire discussion, Mr Norman?
03/01/24, 12:41 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Earn learn looking at probability as you are now vezed with it ,which figure does it approx reduce the fees to..also want to know the Earn while you learn does it become effective during the first year as a student or at a later stage..
03/01/24, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Nokutenda would begin with EWYL while he is still in Zimbabwe and remains the same during the entire course.
03/01/24, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the resources shared earlier regarding the Earn While You Learn Program?
03/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Thank you, I will go through it when Iam home ,am at work right now.. would you mind resending it again.then I will come back to you again tomorrow same time, also after having sat down with Nokutenda
03/01/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
03/01/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: You can click on this message.
03/01/24, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: Good evening Mr Norman.
04/01/24, 9:10 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
04/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 71 375 2896: Not yet.. will come to you when free
04/01/24, 11:46 am - Harmehak: By when shall I expect your response? <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 12:14 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Iam ok, how do we send money to you..
04/01/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: The initial $200 is paid after Nokutenda receives an Acceptance letter.

Are you prepared for the same?
04/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Am prepared
04/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
04/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
04/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
04/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 12:38 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Noted
04/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: As of now, do you have any queries, Mr Norman?
04/01/24, 12:40 pm - +263 71 375 2896: None at the moment,may arise
04/01/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: I understand.

Kindly acknowledge to the Program Director in the group that you are willing to proceed ahead!
04/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: You can complete the interview now <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 12:41 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Ok
04/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Yes please.
04/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, have you connected with Mrs Ruth?
04/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Mr Norman, are you clear that $200 is paid within 7 days if Nokutenda is found eligible?
04/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Have been in touch with her once..
04/01/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Do connect again
04/01/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 9th or 10th January 2023 for $200 and the  9th or 10th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 9th or 10th January 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
04/01/24, 12:50 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Needs to hear more from her ,
04/01/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: Do connect over a call, I believe you would have a better clarity.
04/01/24, 12:52 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Ok will do after work
04/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Are you clear with the same?
04/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Sure
04/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 71 375 2896: But time frame is too short considering kuti Universities commence in August .are you not flexible on this ,and side with parents by considering their veiws when they will be able to raise the monies ,as mot to choke them
04/01/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: While we do understand, Mr Norman.

He would also be beginning with his Earn While You Learn Program after the completion of $200.

Would you agree that you can prepare better in 6 months time for his Education in India rather than 3 months?
04/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 71 375 2896: 6 months is a welcome
04/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: Exactly,

For the same itself the proper financial plans are made so that Nokutenda can begin with his Earn While You Learn Program and you can prepare for his journey, Mr Norman.
04/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Thank you
04/01/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: I did discuss about Nokutenda's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. 

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Nokutenda's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
04/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Thanks
04/01/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Is the same convenient for you Mr Norman?
04/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 71 375 2896: It's convenient for me
04/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: You can inform the Program Director in the interview group.
04/01/24, 2:11 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Ok
04/01/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
05/01/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Good afternoon Mr Norman!

How are you doing today?
05/01/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
06/01/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
06/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 71 375 2896: Morning,am ok ..but now sourcing the funds which is probably at end of the month
06/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?

I believe you must be aware that the initial deadline for $100 is of 12th January, Mr Norman?
06/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 71 375 2896: Will try but definitely was to have around the 28th ,the problem is we got to change our local currency into US dollars
06/01/24, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Mr Norman, do you recall our earlier discussion regarding the initial payment before we proceeded ahead please?
06/01/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: While I do understand, you can have assistance from the bank of Mr Charles Jerera who I would connect you with once Nokutenda is accepted into the program.
06/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 71 375 2896: Yes I do..can I have contacts of Charles Jerera ,I only know Ruth whom I have been in contact with, Charles Jerera is new to me...have you been in touch with Mrs Sunde of Smits Academy so that I will contact her for help
06/01/24, 10:23 am - Harmehak: I shall connect you with Mr Jerera once Nokutenda's accepted into the program.
06/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 71 375 2896: Ok thank you
06/01/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: You're welcome
06/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Heartiest congratulations to you and your family, *Mr. Norman and Mrs. Lois as Nokutenda David Cheuka’s* application was found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I have been so happy and excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage 👏🏽👏🏽.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
06/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Thank you for your assistance
06/01/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
06/01/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
06/01/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

11/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 71 375 2896: Iam ok ,can you consider him on next intake, couldn't make it
11/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: As you must already be aware Mr Norman,

Its mandatory for you to meet the deadline as Nokutenda's application will be blacklisted and if reconsidered it would be with the reapplication fee of $500 itself.
11/01/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: I believe you agreed with proceeding ahead for the application, isn't it?
11/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 71 888 1216: We are really sorry with the life style we are having now. It is impossible for us to pay the expected amount now. We are sorry for the inconveniences caused. We believe that we might honour the deadline but to no avail. We are really sorry. We can't meet the deadline
11/01/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Mr Norman, I would appreciate, if you can share what challenges are you facing as we speak?
11/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 71 888 1216: Financial challenges sinces he is not fully employed this time. He is only working for 14 days per month. So financially he is no stable. Thank you
11/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: I believe you would be assisting as a parent too, isn't it Mr Norman?
11/01/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Am I communicating with Nokutenda? <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 2:57 pm - +263 71 888 1216: No this is her mother.
11/01/24, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Alright Mrs Lois.
11/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 71 888 1216: Thank you 👏🏼
11/01/24, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Lois, did you happen to follow the entire discussion?
11/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 71 888 1216: Yes I've been following since and understood everything and also had faith that we will meet everything according to our discussion but only to discover that it did not come out as planned.
11/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 71 888 1216: We are sorry for the inconveniences caused.
11/01/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand what you are sharing,

Are you aware that you have the option to enrol him for 2025 intake as well?
11/01/24, 3:05 pm - +263 71 888 1216: Yes as you mentioned that it will carry a penalty of $500
11/01/24, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: That's if you miss the deadline and reapply.
11/01/24, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: However if you wish for his application to be considered now itself for 2025 intake, you can pay an initial payment tomorrow to not miss the deadline,

For the remaining the board will be providing you with the application.
11/01/24, 3:07 pm - +263 71 888 1216: Ok it's fine thank you so much 💕
11/01/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
11/01/24, 3:09 pm - +263 71 888 1216: Thank you
11/01/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
11/01/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Would you like to defer Nokutenda's application for 2025 intake?
