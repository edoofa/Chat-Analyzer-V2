However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
28/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 170 1656: If l get into Edoofa's program it can help me enable my dreams by providing me with a schoolarship with accomodation
28/12/23, 3:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
28/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 170 1656: I am willing and promising to give my 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come my way inorder to transform my career
28/12/23, 3:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 170 1656: I would like to study abroad because I believe studying abroad will create more opportunities for me to work abroad
28/12/23, 3:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 170 1656: I will help other learners to do their desertions and their assignments. Also doing part time lectures at local universities
28/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 170 1656: And helping the learners with tuition fees. I would also want to write books in Business Administration
28/12/23, 4:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
28/12/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Okay Good night Ms Garima
29/12/23, 9:25 am - Garima Edoofa: Good morning, hope you’re doing well.

As discussed yesterday, I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
29/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 170 1656: Morning Ms Garima
Yes we can
29/12/23, 10:51 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Melisa, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
29/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 170 1656: Yes l agree
29/12/23, 12:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
29/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Yes l am wondering why
29/12/23, 12:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

29/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Okay thank you Ms Garima
29/12/23, 12:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have understood everything properly?
29/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Yes l did
29/12/23, 12:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: So are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
29/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Yes we are aware, it's very expensive and my family cannot afford I guess
29/12/23, 1:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
29/12/23, 1:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Ms Garima to be honest with you it's difficult for my parents to raise that amount
29/12/23, 1:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Melisa what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 170 1656: It's okay
29/12/23, 1:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
29/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Yes of course
29/12/23, 1:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/12/23, 1:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
29/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Okay l understand
29/12/23, 1:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/12/23, 1:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/12/23, 1:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

29/12/23, 1:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
29/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Yes l think this will be beneficial to me
29/12/23, 2:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/12/23, 2:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Yes Edoofa's indeed different 
Yes this is something I have been looking for regarding my international education
29/12/23, 2:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate that.
29/12/23, 2:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
29/12/23, 2:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
29/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 170 1656: This message was deleted
29/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Can you give me time to go through the points so that i can have an appreciation of all the  four points then I will be able to choose one
29/12/23, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please, I will be waiting for response.
29/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 170 1656: 3. Earn while you learn
02/01/24, 10:32 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263771701656 @263772939466 @263783770688 , hope you all are doing well.
02/01/24, 10:32 am - Garima Edoofa: As discussed earlier I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
02/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 170 1656: Yes we can
02/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 170 1656: Morning how are you
02/01/24, 10:49 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright melisa, I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.
02/01/24, 10:50 am - Garima Edoofa: Basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you in your higher education.
02/01/24, 10:56 am - +263 77 170 1656: Yes they will be
02/01/24, 11:14 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright Melisa, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
02/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Yes l am
02/01/24, 12:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Melisa as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 170 1656: About 2250
02/01/24, 12:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/01/24, 12:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Okay
02/01/24, 12:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Okay
02/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Noted
02/01/24, 12:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: This message was deleted
02/01/24, 12:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
02/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Noted
02/01/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/01/24, 12:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: Melisa basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
02/01/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Okay I get you Ms Garima
02/01/24, 12:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/01/24, 12:31 pm - +263 77 170 1656: Okay
02/01/24, 12:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Melisa, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
02/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 77 170 1656: I understood that Edoofa's program is trying to make the application process cheaper for parents in Africa since most of them cannot afford the payments as they were affected by the *COVID 19 PANDEMIC* it slowed down everything around the world which is one of the reasons Edoofa's program gives the students a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa program with a cheaper fee of $350
There are 3 phases in the enrollment process the first phase that is when the payment is done
Still on the first process Edoofa program made it easier for our parents by making it possible for them to pay the fee that is 200 within 7 days and the other 150 within 30 days
Additionally, On the second phase the students will be starting their Earn while you learn program classes
Lastly on the final phase if the student have passed the necessary requirements as peredoofa then their university evaluation and admission would be continued

08/01/24, 3:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so do you have any questions for me ?
08/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 77 170 1656: As for me no questions yet
08/01/24, 3:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
08/01/24, 4:08 pm - +263 77 293 9466: Yes please including the exact %age of the scholarship
08/01/24, 4:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Your name is already shortlisted for high quantum of scholarship I hope you saw that on your acceptance letter . 
The final percentage of scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship
08/01/24, 4:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
08/01/24, 4:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828
