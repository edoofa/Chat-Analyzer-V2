08/01/24, 12:03 pm - +260 772018150: I'm fine thankyou
08/01/24, 1:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through this course?
08/01/24, 1:32 pm - +260 772018150: Yes I did
08/01/24, 1:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! 
Can you tell me if you have completely understood the course?

08/01/24, 2:08 pm - +260 772018150: Yes I understood everything that was written and I believe it's something that would work for me and my personality.

I believe business administration is not a course that helps in the management of company but also helps one improve their mindset when it comes to finances and the like. At the end of the day if someone was given a dollar in their hands, it's not the dollar that will but what the person believes that dollar can do to change the world and make it a better place

08/01/24, 3:17 pm - +260 772018150: Yes
08/01/24, 3:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?.
09/01/24, 11:10 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
09/01/24, 2:45 pm - +260 772018150: Good afternoon. I'm really sorry for the delayed replies, I have some technical difficulties with my phone
09/01/24, 2:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you pease answer this ?
09/01/24, 2:58 pm - +260 772018150: I feel like studying in India will grant me to tier experience and it will increase the chances of me getting a good job
09/01/24, 3:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Amazing
 
As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
09/01/24, 3:20 pm - +260 772018150: No
09/01/24, 3:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/01/24, 3:25 pm - +260 772018150: Alright
09/01/24, 3:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 3:33 pm - +260 772018150: I think it's something they can work with but it's still a huge amount for them
09/01/24, 3:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please elaborate your concern?
09/01/24, 3:47 pm - +260 772018150: The exchange rate of the dollar is at k25 meaning when we convert the $2000 the amount will be K50000 which is reasonable considering the fact that it caters for everything but it will be a struggle to source that amount of money. My parents are at the moment paying for my older Brother's tution fee which is close to that amount <This message was edited>
09/01/24, 4:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the higher quantum scholarship. With the higher quantum of Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc! <This message was edited>
09/01/24, 4:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you feel it is affordable for your family?
09/01/24, 4:22 pm - +260 772018150: Yes
09/01/24, 4:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well, *Chibesa. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
09/01/24, 4:31 pm - +260 772018150: Yes
09/01/24, 5:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

09/01/24, 5:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
10/01/24, 10:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I sincerely apologize for the delay in today's session. I was engaged in an event where I had the honor of connecting and myself guiding Edoofa students from Africa in India.

I am excited to share about this event, SLICE CON'24- Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators with Edoofa CON'24. Our Edoofians had the privilege of participating in an enlightening industrial visit, interacting with our esteemed Founder, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs.

Take a sneak peek at the glimpses of this auspicious event. Here are some videos and pictures that capture the essence of the day. Enjoy the visual journey!
