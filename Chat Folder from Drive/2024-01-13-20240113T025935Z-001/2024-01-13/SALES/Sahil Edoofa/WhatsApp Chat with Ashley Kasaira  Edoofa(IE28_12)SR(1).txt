I hope you're doing well. I was anticipating your response since Saturday. Is everything okay?
09/01/24, 11:05 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
