I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/01/24, 8:19 am - Gurvinder added +260 97 9527180
12/01/24, 9:10 am - +260 96 8927757: Good morning sir 


I know that the edoofa scholarship helps us Africans to have an opportunity to study in India and it also helps with providing a 50% scholarship for those that qualify for the edoofa program
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/01/24, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 9:44 am - +260 97 9527180: Thank you so much for the detailed information on what the program is all about. We appreciate that our daughter is one of the considered student for the program. We are so excited about it
12/01/24, 9:50 am - +260 96 8927757: When one is doing the work while you earn , does it distract the pupils from there studies or like may it disturb the students from there studies?

When picking people to be part of the edoofa program do results also help you secure your seat in the edoofa program ?
12/01/24, 9:51 am - +260 96 8927757: Thank you for the information 
I know have a broad understanding of the program
12/01/24, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Please do not worry about that, I will explain you everything ahead in the counselling session.
12/01/24, 10:33 am - +260 96 8927757: Alright 
Thank you
12/01/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Namooba, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 12:03 pm - +260 96 8927757: Yes
12/01/24, 12:03 pm - +260 96 8927757: I have what it takes
12/01/24, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Now Namooba, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-
