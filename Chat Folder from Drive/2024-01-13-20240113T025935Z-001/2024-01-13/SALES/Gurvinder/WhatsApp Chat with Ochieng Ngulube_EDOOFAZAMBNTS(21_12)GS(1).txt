*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
23/12/23, 11:05 am - +260 97 7572752: Well spoken
23/12/23, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program more.
23/12/23, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/12/23, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/12/23, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
23/12/23, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
23/12/23, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

23/12/23, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/12/23, 12:02 pm - +260 97 7572752: Truly I take this opportunity with all my heart
23/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Ngulube, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/12/23, 12:21 pm - +260 97 7572752: Yes I think we will manage
23/12/23, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Ngulube, I would like to know your son better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about Him, his career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. His highest education level?
2. The course he would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?

7. Does he have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school does he studies at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

02/01/24, 9:38 am - +260 96 6244869: Morning sir
02/01/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
02/01/24, 10:16 am - +260 96 6244869: Yes and I think all the embodiment of what the course  outlines is exactly what Ochieng is looking for
02/01/24, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: As a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen for Ochieng, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Is Ochieng willing to give 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come his way inorder to transform his career? <This message was edited>
02/01/24, 10:59 am - +260 96 6244869: I have already engaged an extra help I guess he will yield to the 200% threshold
02/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that Ochieng is willing to work hard for his career, however, can you please tell me why you want him to study abroad and not in your country?
02/01/24, 12:26 pm - +260 96 6244869: I feel India has a way of teaching that is unparalleled and I think my son may do well by availing himself to this cutting-edge methodology
02/01/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have him maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning for him to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue his higher education through this scholarship, how is he planning to contribute his learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
02/01/24, 12:42 pm - +260 96 6244869: Well by virtue of the type of training he will undertake, this will places him in the public arena in which he will need to be relevant in order to remain visible and by this I mean he has to develop a genuine heart of wanting to better people's lives
02/01/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mr Ngulube, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
02/01/24, 1:33 pm - +260 96 6244869: I a gree with totality
02/01/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
02/01/24, 1:40 pm - +260 96 6244869: That's what makes the study there inevitable seeing we have a similar background though we have both evolved differently and both of us have diverse strengths which when exploited can give great benefit for both of us
02/01/24, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
02/01/24, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

03/01/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
03/01/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
03/01/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/01/24, 4:03 pm - +260 96 6244869: Much appreciated

04/01/24, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
04/01/24, 10:39 am - +260 96 6244869: Certainly
04/01/24, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: Ochieng, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
