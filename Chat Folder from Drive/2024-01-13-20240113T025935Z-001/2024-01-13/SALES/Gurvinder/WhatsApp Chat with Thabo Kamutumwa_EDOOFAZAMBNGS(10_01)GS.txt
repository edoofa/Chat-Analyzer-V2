10/01/24, 9:16 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Thabo!

I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
10/01/24, 9:56 am - +260 97 7418333: Good morning,from my little understanding these are scholarship offered to school leavers who manage to pass the tests to enable them pursue their studies in India, they require the pupils to be well disciplined  and have the heart for helping and doing alot of community work
10/01/24, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 11:06 am - +260 97 4333579: This message was deleted
10/01/24, 11:13 am - +260 97 7418333: For sure,if awarded the scholarship it would help me have my daughter study and employed at the end of it all,I personally I might not managed to pay for her in a university to enable her pursue her dream due to limited resources
10/01/24, 11:19 am - +260 97 4333579: Yes I would really appreciate that given the chance to learn and earn . And being able to study in a different environment
10/01/24, 11:22 am - +260 97 4333579: It  really has been a dream to study abroad but because of the limited resources I thought it would remain a dream but I can see a possibility of it coming true
10/01/24, 11:41 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Thabo, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
10/01/24, 11:46 am - +260 97 4333579: Having read this I know I do have  want  it takes for me to have an 80 to100 % scholarship on  tuition  and accommodation
10/01/24, 11:47 am - +260 97 4333579: As my mother is also present giving me the support. I need
10/01/24, 11:53 am - +260 97 7418333: My daughter has what it takes to meet two significant metrics and get a higher quantum,am here for her as the mother and pledge to give her the support she will need,financially and morally
10/01/24, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Now Thabo, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
10/01/24, 12:51 pm - +260 97 4333579: - My highest level of education is a grade 12 school certificate.

10/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study dermatology, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
10/01/24, 1:14 pm - +260 97 4333579: So all along I said I wanted to be a doctor  all do something in aviation but when I got to secondary school I realized I wasn't sure with what I wanted to do I then searched deep within me and
Asked  myself    what makes you happy  it was quite  simple  my skin  , and on each skin care product  there was this word that kept on occuring  "dermatology" I got really interested from they  and searched about  and learned more. Then it hit I love everything to do with  skin  care and I have passion for medicine  and in dermatology they are both married so why . For me it was my big break it was like killing two birds with one stone.
10/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
10/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your Grade 10 and Grade 12 results for evaluation?

10/01/24, 1:45 pm - +260 97 7418333: I have only managed to find these
10/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Thabo, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
10/01/24, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
10/01/24, 2:09 pm - +260 97 7418333: This message was deleted
10/01/24, 2:25 pm - +260 97 7418333: So this means without the  3 mandatory subjects in A level,she can't apply in any of the healthcare courses
10/01/24, 3:02 pm - +260 97 7418333: Kindly share other course offered by Edoofa which do not require one to have the A level subjects
10/01/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Please these are the courses that Thabo is eligible for.
10/01/24, 3:52 pm - +260 97 7418333: Is it possible for her to choose another career pathway
10/01/24, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what career are you thinking about?
10/01/24, 4:39 pm - +260 97 4333579: Agronomy

11/01/24, 1:02 pm - +260 97 4333579: Yes sir I've understood it
11/01/24, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
11/01/24, 2:21 pm - +260 97 4333579: Five years from. completing my course in BSC agriculture .I certainly see myself working as an agronomist in the private sector.I would also venture into entrepreneurship which would let me set up a work atmosphere.where interns can , come and learn as I share my experience and knowledge with them .I would also reach out to farmers who have been farming all their lives because it's been passed down generation to generation. But have not had the financial capacity to actually learn the skill. This I also consider a dream come true  . As it is for fulfilling to work with the environment the soil , plants . I may not with the skin. But I  get to see the bigger picture cause I get to work with the environment or in other words I get to work for. I just hope the Edoofa program will help me achieve yet another dream
11/01/24, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Thabo I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear? <This message was edited>
11/01/24, 2:42 pm - +260 97 4333579: 200 and an extra 10%
11/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
11/01/24, 2:59 pm - +260 97 4333579: I can study anywhere I find opportunity
11/01/24, 3:04 pm - +260 97 4333579: It's all about the opportunities being availed to me  not the location
11/01/24, 3:09 pm - +260 97 4333579: But if I really do get this opportunity I stand a chance to experience new perspective , learn how to navigate different cultures , work with diverse peers and also learn to communicate in different languages.
11/01/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
11/01/24, 3:40 pm - +260 97 4333579: Studying abroad  will help strength the network of international  connection , this  allowing both countries to benefit from each other. As I will be implementing those skills learnt from the help of the Edoofa program.Here in my country Zambia . Which can help improve the development of the education system
11/01/24, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Thabo, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
11/01/24, 3:54 pm - +260 97 4333579: Yes I do
11/01/24, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
11/01/24, 4:00 pm - +260 97 4333579: No India was colonized but developed and also enhanced it's education sector . It's truly a higher education destination
11/01/24, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
11/01/24, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

12/01/24, 9:08 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/01/24, 9:10 am - +260 97 4333579: Morning sir
12/01/24, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: So now Thabo, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
12/01/24, 10:00 am - +260 97 4333579: About the accommodation
12/01/24, 10:00 am - +260 97 4333579: And avaition does it cater for that too
12/01/24, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: Please, the cost of travelling to India is a one time cost that you have to bear, but I assure you that our VISA experts will be there to guide you through the whole process.
12/01/24, 11:40 am - +260 97 4333579: That's great,am sure my mum can manage  to finance my trip provided am offered a scholarship
12/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
12/01/24, 12:02 pm - +260 97 4333579: No
12/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
12/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/01/24, 2:01 pm - +260 97 7418333: This 2000 to 3000 dollars is outside the scholarship
12/01/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Mrs Mukela what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/01/24, 3:17 pm - +260 97 4333579: Okay
12/01/24, 3:43 pm - +260 97 7418333: Ok,that's great
