I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
10/01/24, 11:20 am - +260 97 2873802: I think it's program that offers great opportunities to the scholars that want to pursue it
10/01/24, 11:24 am - +260 97 2873802: It provides both accessible and affordable services to learners such as providing them with some of the best internship opportunities which may also lead to job opportunities
10/01/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
10/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
10/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

10/01/24, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 12:12 pm - +260 97 2873802: How much scholarship can I get? and how much do I pay?
10/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 12:20 pm - +260 97 2873802: Yes but can one also seek employment in India
10/01/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Please, let us be patient as this a counselling session, I will address your every concern ahead.
10/01/24, 12:30 pm - +260 97 2873802: Okay
10/01/24, 12:31 pm - +260 97 2873802: Thank you
10/01/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Rhodah, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
10/01/24, 12:37 pm - +260 97 2873802: Yes, I do
10/01/24, 12:39 pm - +260 97 2873802: Though am separated from my parents
10/01/24, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Now Rhodah, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/01/24, 10:45 am - +260 97 2873802: Yes
12/01/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/01/24, 12:47 pm - +260 97 2873802: With the Edoofa's Program by my side and a little bit of extra work I believe I would have a lot of ample job opportunities with the knowledge acquired, I believe I would seek employment from a top notch hospital, clinic or rehabilitation center. After five years I see my self being a real life superhero with skills help patience live longer and healthy lives as well as making close bonds with team mates and patients which I feel is a major benefit. I see myself being one of the best cardiovascular technologist being able to conduct tests on pulmonary or cardiovascular systems of patients for diagnostic  
purposes. Am going to aim higher and further with my studies. I see myself being able to work full time schedules in hospital working fairly during week ends and nights getting familiar to patients by engaging them in small talk and other things which is quite enjoyable
12/01/24, 12:57 pm - +260 97 2873802: I believe I will be satisfied with the line of work I have chosen and I would work hard sense it requires critical thinking quality.
12/01/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Rhodah I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
12/01/24, 1:17 pm - +260 97 2873802: Yes, even more than that because I feel over joyed and really interested to know even more about it
12/01/24, 1:32 pm - +260 97 2873802: Thank you for admirations
12/01/24, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/01/24, 4:42 pm - +260 97 2873802: Because studying abroad gives me the opportunity to see the world from a different aspect experiencing a brand new country with incredible outlooks, customs and activities. It also gives me a chance to experience different styles of education which may not have been exposed in my own country. I also believe it can also be a way for me to understand and appreciate county's history and people, perhaps even granting me an chance to immerse myself in a new language. It would be easier for me to find employment because I would have gotten used to the unfamiliar environment by meeting new life long friends from different backgrounds
