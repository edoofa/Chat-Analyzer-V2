27/12/23, 8:18 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning BLESSMORE, Mr and Mrs MAHACHI!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
27/12/23, 9:01 am - +249 96 758 6108: Good morning  how are you
27/12/23, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs Dube,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
27/12/23, 9:56 am - +249 96 758 6108: Ok thank you for considering my  son for your program
27/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Please, there is no need to thank, let us continue the session now.
27/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs Dube, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Wessly, is that correct?
27/12/23, 10:04 am - +249 96 758 6108: That's correct my son got your information from him
27/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 71 877 0996: Good morning
27/12/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you Blessmore.
27/12/23, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Wessly, also do tell me whether you learnt about Wessly’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
27/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 877 0996: He told me that edoofa program is a scholarship program not a sponsorship program
27/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 877 0996: He also told me about the edoofa earn as you learn program which helps your students to earn some money whilst they learn
27/12/23, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me breif you more about the program.
27/12/23, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
27/12/23, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/12/23, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
27/12/23, 11:38 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
27/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 71 877 0996: Yes thats correct
27/12/23, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Blessmore, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 71 877 0996: It seems good to me so I guess we can start
27/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now Blessmore, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
27/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Is it supposed to be an essay or in point form
27/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Please, can be both.

28/12/23, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/12/23, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
28/12/23, 12:00 pm - +249 96 758 6108: Can it help my son to attain his goal of becoming a chartered accountant
28/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
28/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
28/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
28/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok I understand
28/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 877 0996: But how can this course help me on my journey to my career
28/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.
28/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.
28/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.

28/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok I get it
28/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 877 0996: After I am done with the B.com can I continue to pursue ACCA at your institution
28/12/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Blessmore, unfortunately ACCA course is not available with us, but after you do B.com, you can be an accountant and prepare for ACCA simultaneously.
28/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok that works for me
28/12/23, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
28/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Yes I researched about it a bit after you told me about it
28/12/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
28/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok
28/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Please, do.
28/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 877 0996: The career opportunities for a graduate with a Bachelor of Commerce degree are numerous, and I would love to share my thoughts on how this degree could shape my future. In five years, I see myself working as a chartered accountant at a prestigious firm like Old Mutual. That is after I have finished the ACCA programme elsewhere. Edoofa's program will provide me with the technical skills and knowledge I need to pass the exams required to become a chartered accountant, and the university's reputation will give me a strong competitive edge in the job market. I believe that the degree will also give me the business and leadership skills I need to succeed in my career.
I eagerly anticipate the journey ahead and am confident that my future holds great promise. With a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Edoofa, I am well-prepared to meet the challenges of a career in chartered accounting and will be ready to embrace the opportunities that come my way.
In summary, I am grateful for the educational opportunities that have been made available to me, and I look forward to using these opportunities to reach my full potential.
28/12/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Blessmore, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
28/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Yes I am willing and ready to do my best
28/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 877 0996: I'm looking for a scholarship which may reduce the b
Load  on my parents , in addition most of the universities in Zimbabwe do not offer ACCA
28/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Atleast at your institution I would be able to take it half way towards that goal
28/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 877 0996: I would try to give others the same opportunity given that I have the resources to cater for them
28/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Blessmore, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
28/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 877 0996: That's correct
28/12/23, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Just a little bit curious now that you brought it up
28/12/23, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
28/12/23, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

28/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 877 0996: No not really I think I understand everything I need to know
28/12/23, 8:34 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
29/12/23, 8:19 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
29/12/23, 8:48 am - +263 71 877 0996: Good morning
29/12/23, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
29/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 877 0996: I don't know how much it costs
29/12/23, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/12/23, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/12/23, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/12/23, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:37 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Blessmore what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 877 0996: Ok I understand
29/12/23, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
29/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 877 0996: That sounds good
29/12/23, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Blessmore, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 877 0996: Ok I understand
29/12/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/12/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/12/23, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

29/12/23, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
29/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 877 0996: I think it's good exposure and experience needed by each and every student
29/12/23, 11:38 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Blessmore, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok I understand
29/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/12/23, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
29/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 877 0996: It would be a great opportunity if I get to be part of your institution and it's program
29/12/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Blessmore, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
29/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Yes they would but I want to be able to sustain myself
29/12/23, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, you are able to do that through EWYL, right?
29/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Yes
29/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
29/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Yes  I have
29/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
29/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok I'm ready
29/12/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Blessmore as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 71 877 0996: About $2250 or more
29/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Blessmore, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok I understand
29/12/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 877 0996: I think it's sounds good
29/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 877 0996: But how many universities would I be applying for
29/12/23, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: Please, we will be applying to the Universities for you.
29/12/23, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok
29/12/23, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Blessmore basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
29/12/23, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
29/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok I understand
29/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
29/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 71 877 0996: A bit
29/12/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Blessmore, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
29/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok it's simple enough
29/12/23, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/12/23, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
29/12/23, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
29/12/23, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
29/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 877 0996: At the moment I no further questions
29/12/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
29/12/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
29/12/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

The  genocide in Rwanda had a devastating impact on the country's population, and the effects are still felt today. In particular, the genocide had a disproportionate impact on women, who suffered widespread sexual violence and were left to rebuild their lives and communities without the support of many male family members. The trauma of the genocide also led to an increase in gender-based violence and a decrease in female political participation. Another major social issue that has been affected by the genocide is the issue of orphans and child-headed households. During the genocide, an estimated 250,000 children were orphaned, and many of these children were forced to become heads of households, taking on adult responsibilities at a young age. The government has implemented a number of programs to support these children, including foster care programs, educational assistance, and economic support. Another important issue to consider is the impact of the genocide on mental health. The trauma of the genocide has had a lasting impact on the mental health of many Rwandans, with high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. The government has worked to address these issues through a variety of mental health programs, including trauma counseling, community-based interventions, and the establishment of a national mental health policy. Another major issue that has been impacted by the genocide is the issue of land rights and property disputes. During the genocide, many people were forcibly removed from their land or had their property confiscated. In the aftermath of the genocide, these issues have been a source of conflict and instability, as people have struggled to regain their land and homes. The government has implemented a number of policies to address these issues, including a land reform program and a national commission to resolve property disputes.The genocide had a devastating impact on Rwanda, leading to long-term challenges in a number of areas, including gender inequality, child-headed households, mental health, and land rights. The government has made significant efforts to address these issues, through policies and programs aimed at improving the lives of Rwandans. Although progress has been made, there is still much work to be done to heal the wounds of the genocide and to ensure a more peaceful and prosperous future for the country.
