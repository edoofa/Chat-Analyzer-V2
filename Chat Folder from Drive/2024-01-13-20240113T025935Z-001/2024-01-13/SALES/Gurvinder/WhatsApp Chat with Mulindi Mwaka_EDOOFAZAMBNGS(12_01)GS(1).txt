12/01/24, 8:08 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Mulindi Mwaka!

I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/01/24, 8:23 am - +260 97 7576833: Good morning sir.
My shallow understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program is that the programme is design to reduce the financial burden that less privileged but gifted individuals have. It is meant for focused people that can't afford quality university /college education. It also aim to see to it that the graduates get employment easily.
This is what I know about Edoofa scholarship program.
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/01/24, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 9:39 am - +260 97 3906423: Yes this is like reducing the burdens that is weighed on our parents and this program can help our parents in all this
12/01/24, 9:41 am - +260 97 3906423: And I think it will help me persue a better future for myself and it will help me be an independent student and take more responsibility towards higher education by myself
12/01/24, 9:45 am - +260 97 7576833: Indeed, just like Mwaka has put it, us parents are faced with numerous financial challenges especially concerning the education of our children. Considering the high standards of living coupled with the insufficient income flow, we find it difficult to support quality university for our children.
It is for this reason Edoofa scholarships were established, I believe.
12/01/24, 9:46 am - +260 97 7576833: , *quality university *education*
12/01/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mwaka, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 10:31 am - +260 97 3906423: According to what you said about the program students that have their families in their parents around during the session have a high possibility of getting 80% to 100% on tuition and accomodations so I'm looking forward to Al the procedure
12/01/24, 10:31 am - +260 97 3906423: *All the procedures
12/01/24, 10:33 am - +260 97 3906423: And I guess I have what it takes for me to get a higher quantum of scholarship
12/01/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: Now Mwaka, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-
