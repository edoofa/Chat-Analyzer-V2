12/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 529 2616: These were the questions and my answers are above them
12/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Kelvin who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
12/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 529 2616: Yes, he did. The Quantum of the scholarship I was informed of was 50% - 80%
12/01/24, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Charmaine, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 



In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.

12/01/24, 1:00 pm - +263 77 529 2616: I myself do not have any limitations but my parents are currently at work sir.
12/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 294 2575: I will try to be online with you, Mr Gurvinder.
12/01/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/01/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Now @263775292616 , I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-
