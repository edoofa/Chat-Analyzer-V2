10/01/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Good Morning Grace!

I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
10/01/24, 12:07 pm - +260 762269802: Well i know u help international students find scholarship in inda
10/01/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief yu about the program.
10/01/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
10/01/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
10/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
10/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
10/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
10/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
10/01/24, 12:25 pm - +260 762269802: I was told those of us whoes application where considered would have to take a test how true is that
10/01/24, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
10/01/24, 12:33 pm - +260 762269802: Ok
10/01/24, 12:34 pm - +260 762269802: So how does it work exactly. Do we learn then we're question
10/01/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Please let us be patient, this is a counselling session, the test will just be a general test, do not worry about that now.
10/01/24, 12:39 pm - +260 762269802: My bad.
10/01/24, 12:39 pm - +260 762269802: Ok
10/01/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
10/01/24, 12:40 pm - +260 762269802: Yes so how does it work
10/01/24, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Grace, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
10/01/24, 1:12 pm - +260 762269802: Yes
10/01/24, 1:12 pm - +260 762269802: So where will they be held
10/01/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: In this group only.
10/01/24, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Now Grace, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
10/01/24, 2:11 pm - +260 762269802: -My highest  education level is senior secondary education                           -I would love to study veterinary medicine or animal  science                 -My mother is a senior  secondary  School  science  teacher while my father is a revrand         -My mother has a degree in scienc and my father also has a degree in theology.            -Both my mother and father supported my junior and senior secondary education.        -Both my mother and father would be supporting my higher education abroad.        -I have an elder brother who finished his senior secondary education in 2022 and is waiting for a student loan so he can go to university.i also have a younger brother who finished his junior secondary School education and is starting his senior secondary education this year.                        -I was at Njase girls secondary School which is located in Choma, southern province of zambia.the school's fees per-term was two thousand one hundred and fifty five kwacha(k2155).

11/01/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Grace, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
11/01/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
11/01/24, 10:04 am - +260 762269802: Ok
11/01/24, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: So may I know which course you want to go ahead with?
11/01/24, 9:35 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
