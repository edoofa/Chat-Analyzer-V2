11/01/24, 8:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent.

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your daughter ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your daughter is, what are her strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
11/01/24, 8:50 pm - +263 77 381 9765: We are a nuclear family and stay in Zimbabwe. In our family there are five girls ,Loice being the eldest. I am a teacher by profession and father is a technician. Loice is a hardworking student who is intrinsically motivated. At grade seven she scored 7 units and we send her to Pamushana High School in Bikita where she scooped 13 subjects. Her dream is to be an engineer and she always worked hard in achieving flying colours in science subjects with minimum supervision from parents. Now she is doing her upper six doing a combination of Biology, Chemistry and Maths. She likes reading about inventing things and pays attention to details.  She does all the household chores before going to school and still achieve flying colours. However, as she is from a big family we did not manage to make her continue school at Pamushana and she is doing her form 6 at Seke 1 in Chitungwiza,Harare. She is honest and make us feel proud parents
11/01/24, 8:54 pm - +263 77 381 9765: Her weakness is ,,,,when she lose trust in a person it is difficult for her to trust you again
