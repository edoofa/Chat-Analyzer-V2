10/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 466 9808: My name is Lavender , that you already know 😊. I am currently doing my  'A level' , form six at Glen view 1 Secondary School . My motives are to better up my educational life , Create better living conditions for my family , Do other recreational activities , I wish to open up an orphanage , infact orphanages in the future. I basically love nature and assisting others in every way possible so i would like to exercise that in the future once I'm financially stable. I enjoy reading books , novels etcetera. I was once involved in a certain club at school and was in the writing department.  My friend and i once wrote a novel but all was in vain because of lack of recognition and support. We just went to our headmaster...he did help by correcting some of the language but to no avail the novel did not get published in the end. Nevertheless I just continued writing "poems" on my own till i ceased. I got a collection of them in my gallery. 😂.   Well my father was once a qualified driver at a certain company in town by the name "Barbours". Unfortunately the branch he was positioned at got sold off resulting in the loss of jobs.. From there he became unemployed. Now he's just driving people in town . My mom is self employed. .  We are a family of nine. I have five brothers and two sisters. I'm the second born in my family. <This message was edited>
10/01/24, 3:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: our aspirations reflect a profound commitment to personal growth, family well-being, and a compassionate desire to contribute positively to society. Your dedication to education and creating improved living conditions for your family is truly commendable. The vision of establishing orphanages in the future to support those in need demonstrates a noble and caring spirit. Your love for nature and the pursuit of assisting others exemplify a compassionate and altruistic mindset. Your creative endeavors, from writing novels to composing poems, showcase a resilient and imaginative spirit. Despite facing challenges, your perseverance in expressing yourself through literature is inspiring. Your multifaceted interests, including recreational activities and a desire to make a positive impact on the world, paint a picture of a well-rounded and compassionate individual, Lavender! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed more light on the professions your parents pertain to, please?

11/01/24, 6:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?

11/01/24, 8:02 pm - +263 77 466 9808: Firstly i love to explore..i would really want to visit other countries.

 i want to access high-quality education and academic programs that may tend not be available in my home country. I seek to broaden my knowledge, gain expertise in specific fields, and learn from renowned professors and institutions.

 Studying abroad provides an immersive cultural experience. I'll have the opportunity to live in a different country, interact with locals, and experience a new way of life. I believe this exposure to different cultures, traditions, languages, and perspectives will definitely foster my personal growth, intercultural competence, and a global mindset.
I would Also like to  improve my language skills.Studying abroad offers a chance for personal growth and independence. Living in a foreign country, away from familiar surroundings, family, and friends, challenges students to adapt, become self-reliant, and develop resilience. They learn to navigate new environments, solve problems, and become more confident and self-aware. . I would like to access that for myself as well.
11/01/24, 8:03 pm - +263 77 466 9808: Will be completing my year of A level this year (2024)
11/01/24, 8:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Lavender! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
