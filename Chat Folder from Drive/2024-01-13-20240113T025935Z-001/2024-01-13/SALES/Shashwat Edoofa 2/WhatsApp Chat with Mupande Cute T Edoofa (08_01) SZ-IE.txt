10/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 78 157 2098: One of my goals is to work as a social worker in a community health center, where I would provide support and resources to people in need. I would use my skills in communication and empathy to help my clients, and I would work to advocate for their needs. I'm especially interested in social work because it offers the opportunity to make a real difference in people's lives, and I think that my compassion and dedication would be an asset in this field.
10/01/24, 11:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
10/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 78 157 2098: I've always been interested in social work, because I'm passionate about helping others and making a difference in the world. My interest in social work began when I was a child, and I saw firsthand how important social services were to my community. My family was helped by a social worker, and I saw how much of a difference that person made in our lives. This experience inspired me to pursue a career in social work, so that I could help others the way that we were helped.
10/01/24, 12:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: While there isn't a distinct degree dedicated solely to 'Social Work,' it is primarily a profession or vocational pursuit. Aspiring social workers can embark on this path with a diverse range of academic backgrounds. Nevertheless, when considering the initial steps toward a career in social work, it is customary for students to opt for degrees in fields such as Sociology or Law. May I know what intrigues you more, please?
10/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 157 2098: And in response to your question, I'm most intrigued by the potential for social work to make a real difference in people's lives. I've seen firsthand the impact that social workers can have, and I want to be able to provide that kind of support and guidance to others. I'm also interested in the way that social work can address broader societal issues, such as poverty and inequality. This is why I'm interested in pursuing a degree in sociology, as it will give me a deeper understanding of the social and cultural factors that contribute to these issues.
10/01/24, 1:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Cute. As your *Career Counselor* it is my duty to guide you towards a path that caters to your aspirations.

11/01/24, 11:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Cute.
11/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 157 2098: I have read it
11/01/24, 12:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
11/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 157 2098: I think that studying in India can help me advance in my career in several ways. First, I would gain valuable experience and insight into the Indian education system, which would be highly relevant to my future career as an educator. Second, I would have the opportunity to interact with and learn from experts in the field, who could provide valuable guidance and support. Third, I would gain exposure to different perspectives and ideas, which would help me to develop my own unique perspective on education and how it can be improved.
11/01/24, 12:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
11/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 157 2098: 6000 to 9000
11/01/24, 12:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Cute! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
11/01/24, 12:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 12:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
11/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Noo its not
11/01/24, 12:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
11/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Accomodation
11/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 157 2098: This message was deleted
11/01/24, 1:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have read this message, please?
11/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Yes l have
11/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 78 157 2098: I understood
11/01/24, 1:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: To understand better, the cost of education($2000- $3000)per year that *includes* the *remaining tuition fees, food, and accommodation expenses*.
11/01/24, 1:04 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Okaay
11/01/24, 1:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you think this is affordable, please?
11/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 262 2864: Hello sir or madam .i hope i find you well.
11/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 77 262 2864: I really want my daughter Cute to learn at your school can you pliz  assist with schoolarship  if you can.
11/01/24, 2:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Ruth!
11/01/24, 2:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have been following the session, please?
11/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 262 2864: I was following everything .
11/01/24, 3:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you think this is affordable, please?
11/01/24, 3:10 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Its not affordable
11/01/24, 3:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Do you have a general idea about the cost of education in your home country, please?
11/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Yes
11/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 157 2098: 600 per yr
11/01/24, 3:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Now considering that your home country is Zimbabwe. The average tuition fees of a decent university in Zimbabwe is 1200-1500$ a year which roughly means 750$ per term. On top of that the cost of food averages around 1$ per meal. Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment? Many of our students who are already in India with us have mentioned that students who are studying in Zimbabwe are barely getting any jobs after completing their respective courses.

Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?
11/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Noo
11/01/24, 3:30 pm - +263 77 262 2864: GOVERNMENT  university  they dont charge so much like that .for the whole year ranges to 1500us.
11/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 77 262 2864: 1500 us for expensive one.
11/01/24, 4:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Cute, and Mrs. Ruth. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
11/01/24, 4:26 pm - +263 77 262 2864: Interesting to hear about students work opportunities.
11/01/24, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Ruth. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/01/24, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/01/24, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/01/24, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
11/01/24, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
11/01/24, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child?
11/01/24, 5:07 pm - +263 77 262 2864: Uuum  so beneficial for my child especially  this days where unemployment  is a problem.
11/01/24, 5:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
11/01/24, 5:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
11/01/24, 5:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
11/01/24, 5:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

11/01/24, 5:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
11/01/24, 5:16 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Yess
11/01/24, 5:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is good to know, Cute. May I know whether you think it is affordable now, please?
11/01/24, 5:18 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Yess
11/01/24, 5:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
11/01/24, 5:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
11/01/24, 5:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
11/01/24, 5:22 pm - +263 78 157 2098: 1.earn while you learn programs
2.higher education concierge
3.employability through practical training
4.Affordability through guaranteed scholardhips
11/01/24, 5:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Cute! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
11/01/24, 5:27 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Earn while you learn programs
11/01/24, 5:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
11/01/24, 5:32 pm - +263 78 157 2098: They really want me to study abroad ..because here in Zimbabwe theres unemployment
11/01/24, 5:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
11/01/24, 5:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
11/01/24, 5:41 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Yes
11/01/24, 5:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
11/01/24, 5:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
11/01/24, 5:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 5:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
11/01/24, 5:48 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Okay
11/01/24, 5:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
11/01/24, 5:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
11/01/24, 5:51 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Ok
11/01/24, 5:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
11/01/24, 6:02 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Edoofa helps by the program earn while you learn..and that you can pay in installments
11/01/24, 6:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
11/01/24, 6:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 6:06 pm - +263 78 157 2098: 2
11/01/24, 6:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
11/01/24, 6:07 pm - +263 78 157 2098: Yes
11/01/24, 6:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
