02/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 910 8942: Oh yeah I had a discussion with them & they said that if it's affordable they can at least make an effort but if it is beyond their earnings then I will have to choose otherwise

This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship.

02/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 78 910 8942: Alright
02/01/24, 12:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This message was deleted
02/01/24, 12:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: A very pleasant afternoon to everyone. I am done with my lunch. Thank you for your patience.
02/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 78 910 8942: I'm around
02/01/24, 12:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Trish. I must say that you have obtained impeccable grades! You mentioned your affinity towards the healthcare sector. Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
02/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 78 910 8942: I can confidently say that it had been my dream since I was in grade one to become a doctor then came form 2 when I wanted to base with computers but whenever I tried to attempt codes I had this kind of rejection which I felt inside....then I met this wise old lady who told me that I belong to the medical field.....& whenever I tried to imagine myself in ten years time as a doctor I felt happy & also I felt a sense of belonging
02/01/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 910 8942: About choosing area of specialisation....after a careful scrutiny into the medical field, the neuro department nerds more people....because it doesn't due to its complexity & I also felt the need to reach out to those little kids with neurological disorders because they have the potential to change the world to a better place therefore we need to make sure that their medical needs are met & also the department is better paying therefore I can fulfil my dreams
02/01/24, 1:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India, he/she has to crack the entrance exam, NEET, which selects only a limited number of students from a vast pool of applicants. NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) is challenging due to its comprehensive syllabus, fierce competition, and the need to excel in biology, physics, and chemistry, making it a demanding examination for aspiring medical students.
02/01/24, 2:06 pm - +263 78 910 8942: Do I have to pay for this entrance exam
02/01/24, 2:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Trish. This is an extremely competitive exam. Furthermore, you need to have to have a student visa to give the exam, please.
02/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 910 8942: I believe can take it. Student visa what is it for
02/01/24, 3:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Trish. I would like to inform you that in order to travel to India for the exam, you will need a student visa. Obtaining this visa typically requires enrolling in a university or educational institution in India. Therefore, pursuing a course of study in India is a prerequisite for traveling to the country to take the exam.
02/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 910 8942: So what should I do now
02/01/24, 3:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Trish. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
02/01/24, 3:30 pm - +263 78 910 8942: Yeah sure
02/01/24, 3:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that she/he could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

9. *Bachelor of Pharmacy*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?

03/01/24, 5:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have done any prior research regarding the course, please?
03/01/24, 5:22 pm - +263 78 910 8942: No I haven't
03/01/24, 5:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know how the course aligns with your future aspirations, please?
03/01/24, 5:25 pm - +263 78 910 8942: I haven't delved deep into it but I know a bit, that it has something to do with the heart, veins , arteries , capillaries and also blood flow
03/01/24, 5:29 pm - +263 78 910 8942: Well ....since your list does not include what I actually want then I'll have to switch to the current situation and try to fit myself into i, adapt  and make some small changes that is instead of neuro I will have to stick to cardiovascular the difference won't be that big. The reason why I go for cardiovascular on the above list is it's complexity nature & still I will be operating in the pediatric department.i think that way it will work out.

Origin of interest...
I felt the need to reach out to those in hospitals because I got to see that some of the patients in hospitals are not visited often and the feel alone and unloved  so that is where I wanna fit in...& It also open doors for interaction and socialisation as well as getting to know different behaviours and attitudes which also improves the way I interact with different patients based on their attitudes.

08/01/24, 3:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Trish. There are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology or Cardiovascular Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.

Cardiovascular Technology involves the use of non-invasive procedures to diagnose and treat heart and blood vessel disorders. This field requires a strong foundation in biology and anatomy and offers courses in electrocardiography, echocardiography, and vascular technology. Students with a degree in Cardiovascular Technology can work in hospitals and clinics and can gain valuable experience in the field of cardiology.

Both Medical Laboratory Technology and Cardiovascular Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in one of these fields is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially.
