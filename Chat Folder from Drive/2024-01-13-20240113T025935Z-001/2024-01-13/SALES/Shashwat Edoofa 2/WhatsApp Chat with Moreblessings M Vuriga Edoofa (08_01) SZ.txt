11/01/24, 11:33 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Mr. Nhamo. I truly appreciate your sincerity! You mentioned Moreblessings's affinity towards Business Administration. Could you kindly brief me regarding her Career Aspirations more vividly, please?
11/01/24, 11:51 am - +27 83 955 2554: Ok.thanks a lot for your time ...she actually  aspires to be a business administrator  .She however has also a passion  in Nursing..so these are the two fields that she has always been talking about since childhood..we therefore ask for a clearer course outline so that given an opportunity, she chooses between Business administration  and Nursing..we ,as her parents would highly  appreciate if she finds her self getting one of this fields.
11/01/24, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know which field intrigues her the most, please?
11/01/24, 12:25 pm - +27 83 955 2554: Nursing sir/madam
11/01/24, 12:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew her towards this peculiar domain, please?
11/01/24, 1:47 pm - +27 83 955 2554: I remember  well when she was at primary level,at a very tender age,she was was an Actor in the school drama.so she happened to be a Nurse in one of the drama series..so she developed  a passion in Nursing..we had to advise her to make sure she passes English,Maths and science at ordinary level. She worked extremely  hard and managed to pass these among others..she still  maintains that if she becomes a nurse ,it will be a dream come true
11/01/24, 2:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mr. Nhamo, could you please share why Moreblessings didn't pursue Physics, Chemistry, or Biology in her A level?

I believe they are very crucial science/medical subjects, isn't it?
11/01/24, 3:35 pm - +27 83 955 2554: In Zimbabwe  ,for one to be enrolled at Nursing institutions,Maths ,English and integrated science are prerequisite..so she mastered those and manage to pass those among  other subjects.Physics ,chemistry and biology  are pursued by somebody who wants to undertake medical doctor profession.For sure they are crucial ..The reason  she did not do pursue science subjects emanate from the fact that the Nursing institutions require ordinary level passes which she has,and They consider A level as an added advantage.
11/01/24, 3:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand your perspective, Mr. Nhamo. However, I will have to inform you that the minimum threshold that a student needs to fulfill in order to pursue Nursing/ Medicine is Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in his/her A-Level, please.
11/01/24, 3:45 pm - +27 83 955 2554: Understood,the Zimbabwean requirements at diploma level are different  from the scenario you have just stated...that is why I had wanted  to see course outlines and requirements...sometimes one has to do a completely different study due to failure  to meet the requirements of the preferred area of study...kindly help so that we choose  from the programs available...
11/01/24, 4:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Nhamo. May I know whether Moreblessings is interested in pursuing business administration, please?
11/01/24, 4:27 pm - +27 61 641 4334: Yes sir I have interest in pursuing bussiness administration
11/01/24, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what fascinates you regarding the domain, please?
11/01/24, 5:28 pm - +27 61 641 4334: The world has turned into a very complex system whereby at some point one has to be their own employer.so I feel if I do business administration,I stand a chance of being my own boss.besides,I can qualify working both in the private and public sector.bussiness is life.
11/01/24, 5:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Moreblessings. As your *Career Counselor* it is my duty to guide you towards a path that caters to your aspirations.
