Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
05/01/24, 7:17 pm - +27 78 003 4261: I am 45 and my wife is 43. Simba is the eldest of our 3 children. 
Our highest level of Education is national Diploma for both me and my wife. I have a Diploma in  Instrumentation and Control while Patience has a Diploma in Forestry. 
I am currently working in South Africa as a Technician on a contract basis. 
We always want to equip our children with the best education hence in 2023 we decided to move our children back to Zimbabwe where we believed they will get better education and also scholarships opportunities if they studied Cambridge examinations.  University education is very expensive in Zimbabwe and South Africa hence we support our children to excel in school so that they can qualify for bursaries and scholarships. 
Simba has always been a keen and responsible student throughout his primary and secondary education and now in advanced level he has improved immensely. 
Through his achievements academically and also his conduct, he has been appointed to be a prefect at his current school.  
So besides being an excellent student he is also a natural leader. He is currently studying Business and Economics subjects at A level.

08/01/24, 2:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Mr. Fortune.
08/01/24, 3:04 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Thank you very much. I am done reading. This is very interesting. I wasn't aware of   a lot of information
08/01/24, 3:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in sending Simbarashe to India for his higher studies!
08/01/24, 3:07 pm - +27 78 003 4261: I am definitely interested sir
08/01/24, 3:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
08/01/24, 3:12 pm - +27 78 003 4261: No. I haven't really looked at it yet. But in SA it's expensive and it can go up to more than R100 000 which is expensive for most parents if they do not get government assistance
08/01/24, 3:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Fortune! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
08/01/24, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
08/01/24, 3:23 pm - +27 78 003 4261: If we get assistance,  we can try by all means to make sure we can afford the reduced fee. It can be done
08/01/24, 3:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Fortune. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
08/01/24, 3:38 pm - +27 78 003 4261: I don't have an idea. But I'm sure Simbarashe would grab any opportunity with both hands as it will assist us pay for his education while we also continue making sure his siblings finish high school
08/01/24, 3:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Fortune. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/01/24, 3:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/01/24, 3:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/01/24, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
08/01/24, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/01/24, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child? <This message was edited>
08/01/24, 3:49 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Yes. Of course this will be be beneficial to Simbarashe because besides earning some credit to contribute towards his tuition, he will also be earning some experience and work in different environments and with different people
08/01/24, 6:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
08/01/24, 6:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
08/01/24, 6:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
08/01/24, 6:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

08/01/24, 6:52 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Yes, it's very clear and I'm 100% sure he will be able to do this. I have a lot of faith and confidence in his ability if he manage to be selected for a scholarship.
08/01/24, 10:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 9:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." - Nelson Mandela*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
09/01/24, 9:04 am - +27 78 003 4261: Good morning,
Indeed, indeed. A good education is the best inheritance we can leave our children. 
I am ready. We can start
09/01/24, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Fortune!
09/01/24, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
09/01/24, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
09/01/24, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
09/01/24, 10:35 am - +27 78 003 4261: To me all the four points make this program outstanding from all the other programs I know of. But the Affordability and Earn While You Earn gives a very huge benefit to me as a parent.
Also the fact that there is Higher Education Concierge guarantees that the student is employable in future. I can say I simply love everything about the 4 points
09/01/24, 11:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mr. Fortune! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
09/01/24, 11:01 am - +27 78 003 4261: The Earn While You Earn is my favorite
09/01/24, 11:30 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how you feel about Simbarashe studying abroad?
09/01/24, 11:39 am - +27 78 003 4261: It's something that I have always wished for him because I believe being in a different environment and meeting new people and studying new cultures will broaden his worldview and enhance his opportunities in life. Although as a parent I will be a bit concerned since it he will be his first time on his own, I am confident it's still the best decision for him
09/01/24, 12:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can conclude that he is diligent and possesses extreme valor. He will surely prove his mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that he will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate his career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling him to independently support his family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for his parents.
09/01/24, 12:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
09/01/24, 12:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
09/01/24, 12:09 pm - +27 78 003 4261: I also think academic records and other educational qualifications can be send with all the above
09/01/24, 12:13 pm - +27 78 003 4261: When are we requested to send these?
09/01/24, 12:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Fortune. We here at Edoofa have a dedicated team that will help Simbarashe with his *Statement of Purpose* as well as the *Letter of Recommendation*!
09/01/24, 12:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
09/01/24, 12:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/01/24, 12:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 12:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
09/01/24, 12:20 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Thank you so much. Please let me know if there is anything required from me and I will make it happen
09/01/24, 12:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Simbarashe Madzokere Edoofa (05/01) SZ" to "Simbarashe Madzokere Edoofa (05/01) SZ 2025"
09/01/24, 12:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
09/01/24, 12:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
09/01/24, 12:27 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Does this $350 also include the $750 mentioned earlier?
09/01/24, 12:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly elaborate on your query, please?
09/01/24, 12:34 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Okay, i think I understand. When the students is accepted, the parents can they pay $350. Which can be paid in 2 installments of $200 in 7 days and $150 within 30 days. Correct?
09/01/24, 12:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mr. Fortune.
09/01/24, 12:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
09/01/24, 1:15 pm - +27 78 003 4261: What I have understood right now is that Edoofa offers the student the opportunity to learn at highly recommended Indian universities. 
I have understood about the Indian Education system and how it is one of the best in the world and has produced very prominent persons and CEOs in the world's top organizations. 
Edoofa offers the student an opportunity to study in India at very subsidized cost to the parent and there is also the Earn While You Earn program where students are exposed to typical employment where they earn credit and this credit is used as a discount on the fees required by for the student therefore further reducing the burden on the parents.
Edoofa assists the student with the application Application,  Letter of purpose and Letter of recommendation at fee that is far less than what it would cost if the student was applying alone.  Once a student is accepted by the Recommendation board and they receive letter of Acceptance,  the parent can pay only $350 which can be paid in 2 installments of $200 within 7 days and $150 within 30 days. Edoofa will then start applying for the student even when the A-level results are not yet out and will finalise application once results are out. 
Once the student has been accepted by the Academic board and the program fee of $350 has been paid, the student will start the Earn As you learn program classes.
Once the A level results are out and the student has passed, then final University admissions will continue with the help from Edoofa.
09/01/24, 1:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
09/01/24, 1:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 1:43 pm - +27 78 003 4261: I think we have discussed all 6 stages from
1. Personalised counseling where Edoofa sits with the student and parents
2. Eligibility Check test and interview 
3.Acceptance into Edoofa
4.Enrollment into Edoofa
5. Financial Planning 
6.Admission letter and Visa

So far if I'm not mistaken we busy with phase 1 where there is the personalised counseling session
09/01/24, 1:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
09/01/24, 1:55 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Yes, we can go ahead. This is very interesting
09/01/24, 1:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
09/01/24, 2:07 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Yes, everything is very clear to me
09/01/24, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

Stay Blessed!
10/01/24, 8:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"In learning, you will teach, and in teaching, you will learn." - Phil Collins*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
10/01/24, 8:59 am - +27 78 003 4261: Good morning,
I am ready if you are
10/01/24, 9:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I trust that you've had the opportunity to discuss the points mentioned above with your family. I'm here to assist with any questions you may have. Would it be agreeable to proceed with Simbarashe's application now?
10/01/24, 9:24 am - +27 78 003 4261: Yes, I discussed with the family last night and I also contacted Mrs Magwaza. I don't have any questions at the moment. Yes, we can proceed with the application
10/01/24, 9:27 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
10/01/24, 9:34 am - +27 78 003 4261: 1. Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA)
2. India
3. $6000-$8000 per year
4. $2000-$3000
5. $350
6. Within 7 days
7. Yes. It was made clear to me that the registration fee is $500-$1000
10/01/24, 9:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are you ready for the same, please?
10/01/24, 9:39 am - +27 78 003 4261: Yes, I am ready
10/01/24, 9:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
10/01/24, 9:56 am - +27 78 003 4261: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 10:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
10/01/24, 10:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
10/01/24, 10:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
10/01/24, 10:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 10:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th January 2024 for $200 and the 17th or 18th of February for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
10/01/24, 10:22 am - +27 78 003 4261: I would tentatively go for the first option. But if I have enough funds, on the said date, I will pay the whole amount so as to speed up the process
10/01/24, 10:31 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
10/01/24, 10:34 am - +27 78 003 4261: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 10:51 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Considering that you have provided comprehensive answers to all the inquiries, the next step in the process involves scheduling a video call with the Program Director. Once I submit the evaluation report for the application of Simbarashe, I will promptly arrange suitable time slots for the video call. Could I inquire about your availability for tomorrow to proceed with this arrangement?
10/01/24, 10:55 am - +27 78 003 4261: Yes. I will make myself available for the video call. Will it be for me only or you also need Simbarashe and Patience

Also, make the necessary preparations for a video call. Please note that the director will only conduct the interview once, and missing it may lead to application cancellation. Best of luck!
