12/01/24, 2:49 pm - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about her achieving it.
12/01/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 232 4967: Yes I'm very confident that she'll get very good results

12/01/24, 5:17 pm - +263 77 232 4967: Definitely India would be a good place for my child to do her studies
12/01/24, 5:18 pm - Arshita: *By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
12/01/24, 5:19 pm - +263 77 232 4967: No I'm not that familiar
12/01/24, 5:22 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/01/24, 5:22 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 5:22 pm - Arshita: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
12/01/24, 5:26 pm - +263 77 232 4967: Yes l do feel that it will very affordable
12/01/24, 5:28 pm - +263 77 232 4967: Will be*
12/01/24, 5:40 pm - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
12/01/24, 6:21 pm - +263 77 232 4967: Tell me how it's done
12/01/24, 6:35 pm - +263 77 232 4967: Please bear with me. My network reception is very bad today
12/01/24, 8:45 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 8:47 pm - +263 77 232 4967: Thank you. I'll be available at 9am tomorrow.

Stay blessed too.
