We are associated with many schools in Harare, some of them are the Nation's best schools, including *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John's, Harare High, Advent Hope Academy etc*

12/01/24, 1:43 pm - Arshita: Noted
12/01/24, 1:43 pm - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
12/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 78 739 4878: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 78 739 4878: I will aim higher and l will try to attain my best grade possible
12/01/24, 1:57 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
12/01/24, 1:58 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/01/24, 2:01 pm - +263 78 739 4878: I have done most my research on Edoofa and how its system works 
I have not applied to any university abroad
12/01/24, 2:08 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
