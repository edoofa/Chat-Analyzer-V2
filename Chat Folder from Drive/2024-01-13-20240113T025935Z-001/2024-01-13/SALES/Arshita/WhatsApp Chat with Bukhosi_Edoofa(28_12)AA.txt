29/12/23, 9:38 am - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
29/12/23, 9:38 am - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
29/12/23, 9:38 am - +263 71 516 5151: Very Confident
29/12/23, 9:42 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

29/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 516 5151: I only applied for this schorlaship 
Thus far
29/12/23, 9:45 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
29/12/23, 9:45 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>

Thank you for the Awareness initiative
29/12/23, 9:56 am - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
29/12/23, 9:57 am - Arshita: Since you are not having Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest and passion in the field there are courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help you fulfil your dreams of working in this field

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
29/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 71 516 5151: No
29/12/23, 11:03 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 516 5151: Ok
29/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 516 5151: Great
29/12/23, 11:04 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 11:04 am - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
29/12/23, 11:05 am - +263 71 516 5151: Yes . It is affordable 
My parents can try something there
29/12/23, 11:06 am - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
29/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 516 5151: No
Would like to know
29/12/23, 11:09 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
29/12/23, 11:09 am - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
29/12/23, 11:09 am - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/12/23, 11:09 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/12/23, 11:09 am - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
29/12/23, 11:09 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 11:09 am - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
29/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 516 5151: Oh great
29/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 516 5151: Yes I think It will be of great help and I will benefit
29/12/23, 11:18 am - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
29/12/23, 11:18 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 71 516 5151: Noted.
I understand now
29/12/23, 11:22 am - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
29/12/23, 11:22 am - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
29/12/23, 11:22 am - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
29/12/23, 11:22 am - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
29/12/23, 11:22 am - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
29/12/23, 11:22 am - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
29/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 516 5151: 3
29/12/23, 11:25 am - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.
29/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 516 5151: Okay

29/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 516 5151: Aaa inspiring 
Great
29/12/23, 11:29 am - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 516 5151: My Parents
29/12/23, 11:30 am - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 516 5151: Yes.
I will discuss  everything. 
They are also intrigued by the idea of studying abroad
29/12/23, 11:33 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
29/12/23, 11:33 am - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
29/12/23, 11:33 am - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
29/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 516 5151: Yes true
29/12/23, 11:37 am - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
29/12/23, 11:37 am - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
29/12/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
29/12/23, 11:39 am - +263 71 516 5151: Yes 
Sum up everything
29/12/23, 11:39 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
29/12/23, 11:39 am - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 71 516 5151: Okay
29/12/23, 11:40 am - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
29/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 516 5151: Okay great
29/12/23, 11:43 am - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
29/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 516 5151: Okay 
I understand
29/12/23, 11:46 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 71 516 5151: Enrolment into Edoofa program
29/12/23, 11:48 am - Arshita: Absolutely correct! 

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
29/12/23, 11:49 am - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
29/12/23, 11:49 am - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
29/12/23, 11:49 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
29/12/23, 11:49 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
29/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 516 5151: Very clear
29/12/23, 4:21 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
29/12/23, 4:21 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

01/01/24, 2:38 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
01/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 71 516 5151: Okay
01/01/24, 5:36 pm - Austin: Good Evening to you all!
How was your day?
01/01/24, 5:37 pm - Austin: Bukhosi, May I know did you managed to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
01/01/24, 5:37 pm - +263 71 516 5151: Yes I did
01/01/24, 5:37 pm - +263 71 516 5151: Good yours?
01/01/24, 5:40 pm - Austin: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
01/01/24, 5:40 pm - Austin: Great, my day was blessed
01/01/24, 5:41 pm - +263 78 607 7953: Iam Bukhosi's mother. Greetings Sir and Complements of the New Year
01/01/24, 5:41 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Mrs Maphosa!
How are you doing?

Thank you and same to you!
01/01/24, 5:42 pm - +263 78 607 7953: I am fine. Thank you Sir
01/01/24, 5:44 pm - Austin: Glad to hear that!
I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
01/01/24, 5:44 pm - +263 71 516 5151: Well, I told my parents about this opportunity that I had been given by Edoofa and they were also very interested in the edoofa schorlaship like me.
They also believed that it was legit given its history and the footages you sent confirming that it was not a scam
So I can safely say they are also interested in the Edoofa organisation. 
They are willing to help in any way possible to make this a success 💪🏾
01/01/24, 5:45 pm - Austin: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session! 

I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career. So may I know if your family or you have any queries, please
01/01/24, 5:47 pm - +263 78 607 7953: Thank you for affording us the opportunity to be part of the selection. We appreciate your professionalism and clarity about the program.
01/01/24, 5:48 pm - Austin: You are most welcome, Mrs Maphosa, thank you for your good words and I believe Bukhosi will give the best to grab this opportunity
01/01/24, 5:49 pm - +263 78 607 7953: So far everything is clear and we appreciate your effort in giving our son a life time opportunity to fulfill his dream.
01/01/24, 5:50 pm - +263 78 607 7953: Maybe just clarify on the issue of visa payments and accommodation arrangements
01/01/24, 5:51 pm - Austin: This is well noted!
01/01/24, 5:52 pm - Austin: The cost of visa application is $83 which is to be paid by the student's parents at the embassy during the visa process. Our Admissions Team will be guiding you through the same thereby simplifying the formalities. It usually takes 7-15 days to secure a visa and the process begins 1-2 months before the intake of the Edoofian
01/01/24, 5:52 pm - Austin: There are two options for Accommodation from which you are free to choose. 

1) Campus Accommodation- Students live in hostels inside the University premises.You are free to choose the type of hostel rooms and the seaters. There are single seaters, two seaters and more. 

2) Outside Campus-Accommodation is arranged in apartments outside the University campus.It is close to Universities and cheaper than in campus

After the University Sessions you will be given these options and can choose from them
01/01/24, 5:54 pm - +263 78 607 7953: Noted with thanks. We are grateful the Admissions Team will be there to assist
01/01/24, 5:55 pm - +263 78 607 7953: Noted Sir.
01/01/24, 5:55 pm - +263 71 516 5151: Noted
01/01/24, 5:55 pm - Austin: You are welcome!

May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
01/01/24, 5:58 pm - +263 78 607 7953: This fees are fair and given the Earn while you Learn Program it really reduces the cost burden
01/01/24, 6:00 pm - Austin: This is well noted and I appreciate your willingness to invest in Bukhosi's career!
01/01/24, 6:01 pm - Austin: So Bukhosi, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
01/01/24, 6:12 pm - +263 71 516 5151: 1. Bachelor of Computer Application 

2. India
3.  For international students it's around USD6000 - USD8000 per year
4.  USD 2000- USD 3000
01/01/24, 6:13 pm - +263 71 516 5151: More answers coming
01/01/24, 6:18 pm - +263 71 516 5151: 5.  Enrolment fee is $750 but was reduced to $350 because of the Covid pandemic.
Ideally it should be paid in 7days but there is leniency to pay $200 in 7days and the remaining  $150 within the next 30days
01/01/24, 6:37 pm - +263 71 516 5151: 6.  Brief Summary of Earn while you learn (EWYL)

From my understanding,  I see it as a unique opportunity given to students to develop skills while also benefiting by earning schorlaship credits which can be used in helping pay the fees .
I understand that different skills can be acquired during this program which can be useful even in life and careers. Skills like Content writing and Blog writing can also be used as a way to generate other sources of Income even in a later stage in life thanks to the program.
The program intends to help students to study University in a cheaper way by using the credits they scored.
This program is very helpful and beneficial  to students who cannot afford the fees.
It lifts the financial strain off the parents/guardians and gives every student to have the access to quality education. 
It's a great programme which is willing to award the hardworking students to have a go on their various dreams.
01/01/24, 6:38 pm - +263 71 516 5151: 10. Very clear
01/01/24, 6:42 pm - Austin: Good Work, Bukhosi!
01/01/24, 6:42 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
01/01/24, 6:42 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
01/01/24, 6:42 pm - Austin: Dear parent @263786077953 , Before proceeding further, we would like to ensure that you are fully aligned and supportive of the career path of your child.

05/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 71 279 8770: Payment *rather
05/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 71 279 8770: Mayebe one question  sir, what determines the percentage level scholarship offered, ie its said in the letter that the scholarship will be between 50% and 100%. What can make it 100% or fail it to be the same?
05/01/24, 11:38 am - Austin: That is right and we will begin the admissions process and the Earn While You Learn program for Bukhosi after the payment of the first part itself($200)
05/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 71 279 8770: Noted, thank you
05/01/24, 11:39 am - Austin: The final percentage of scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship

05/01/24, 11:46 am - Austin: You are most welcome!
05/01/24, 11:46 am - Austin: Basically, the Earn While You Learn program offers Edoofians the opportunity to Earn Scholarship Credits by doing online projects on different platforms. Our students will be given online projects related to Researching, Content writing, Managing and Leading People, Community Building, Digital Marketing and many more. Based on their performance students can Earn Scholarship credits and reduce their fees. This fee will not be physical cash rather it would be reduced from the cost of education directly

All these projects are performed on online platforms and our EWYL mentors will be guiding them. The working hours are flexible and students can invest their free time.
05/01/24, 11:46 am - Austin: It begins within few days of the child's enrollment

08/01/24, 8:48 am - Austin: Good Morning Mr&Mrs Maphosa and Bukhosi!
How was your weekend?
08/01/24, 8:49 am - +263 71 516 5151: The weekend was good .
How about your side?
08/01/24, 8:52 am - +263 71 279 8770: Good morning sir, we are fine thanks,  hope you are fine as well
08/01/24, 9:57 am - Austin: Good to hear that, I am doing well
08/01/24, 9:57 am - Austin: My weekend was blessed too
08/01/24, 9:58 am - Austin: Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program as of now?
08/01/24, 10:00 am - +263 78 607 7953: Good day Sir
08/01/24, 10:03 am - +263 78 607 7953: It was mentioned that the scholarship is between 50-100%  depending on the performance of the student. For starters, to get at least 50% of the scholarship, what is the minimum number of points required for A level results.
08/01/24, 10:03 am - Austin: Good to hear from you!
08/01/24, 10:06 am - Austin: Please note that by qualifying for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, Bukhosi is now eligible for the minimum of 50% scholarship already. Interms of Academic requirements, the minim points required are 2 A level passes, but we always encourage our students to target for the maximum
08/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 71 279 8770: Thank you for the opportunity given to ask, kindly elaborate on travel tickets, visas and other related costs, ie does the program give some assistance on those or it is the responsibility of the child's parents?
08/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 71 279 8770: Also , after paying the USD350 acceptance fees, are there any other immediate payments that we have to make?
08/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 78 607 7953: Noted. Thank you Sir for the clarification.
08/01/24, 10:23 am - Austin: You are welcome, If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
(air fare :-around $450,Visa fee:-$83) *is to be catered by the student* which is mostly a one-time investment and you have time till the intake of Bukhosi to prepare for the same
08/01/24, 10:23 am - Austin: Regarding the visa, our Admissions Team will be guiding you through the formalities thereby simplifying them for you
08/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 71 279 8770: Well explained, understood and appreciated,  thanks a lot
08/01/24, 10:42 am - Austin: There are no immediate payments. After receiving the Offer Letters from Universities, the registration is to be paid but it is not an additional cost as the cost is a part of the cost of education itself. Also, after the enrollment fee payment, our Admissions team will be guiding you through the tentative dates and payment plans for your financial planning
08/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 71 279 8770: Noted, thanks
08/01/24, 10:53 am - Austin: You are welcome!
08/01/24, 10:53 am - Austin: Do you have other questions for me please?
08/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 71 279 8770: I think for now, I have no further questions,  thank you
08/01/24, 10:57 am - Austin: You are welcome!
08/01/24, 11:01 am - Austin: Did you manage to connect to Mr&Mrs Jerera to discuss the program and their experiences?
08/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 71 279 8770: Yes, I did connect with Mrs Jerera and she shared a bit and everything she said was positive about the program.  We will continue discussing as we get time. Thanks
