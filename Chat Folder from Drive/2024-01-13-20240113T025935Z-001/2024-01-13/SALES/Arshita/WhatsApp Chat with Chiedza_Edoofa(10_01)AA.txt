11/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 77 827 1084: In August this  year
11/01/24, 10:23 am - Arshita: Noted
11/01/24, 10:23 am - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
11/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 827 1084: Okay  for the nursing degree how  many points are needed?
11/01/24, 10:28 am - Arshita: This is the minimum requirement
11/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 77 827 1084: 2 points???
11/01/24, 10:31 am - Arshita: Yes
11/01/24, 10:31 am - Arshita: May I know with your interest in nursing why didn't you opt for science at A level?
11/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 827 1084: I once did my A level and the  results were not pleasing so upon  repeating i changed the combination
11/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 77 827 1084: So am supplementing my  points
11/01/24, 10:44 am - Arshita: Noted
11/01/24, 10:44 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
11/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 77 827 1084: No as for now I haven't but was hoping to apply using the results. BUT i have been a research on university abroad that offer scholarships
11/01/24, 10:49 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
11/01/24, 10:49 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 10:50 am - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
11/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 827 1084: Done
11/01/24, 12:11 pm - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
11/01/24, 12:14 pm - Arshita: Since you do not have science you are not eligible for nursing. 

At the same time do you have any alternate career aspirations?
11/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 77 827 1084: Whatt are the list of degree programs offered at the universities that accommodate art students

11/01/24, 12:58 pm - Arshita: For forensic you need science
11/01/24, 1:00 pm - Arshita: In the field of arts we have law, sociology

It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
