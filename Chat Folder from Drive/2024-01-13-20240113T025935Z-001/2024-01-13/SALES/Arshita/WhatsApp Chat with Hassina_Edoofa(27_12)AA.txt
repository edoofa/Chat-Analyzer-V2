12/01/24, 2:48 pm - Arshita: Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

We accept upto 7=pass for a subject. Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35. This would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program. The minimum requirement was higher before the pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and performing well in MSCE.
12/01/24, 2:50 pm - +265 881 93 55 88: Yes am very confident
12/01/24, 2:50 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/01/24, 2:52 pm - +265 881 93 55 88: No I did not apply to any university abroad
12/01/24, 3:09 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
12/01/24, 3:10 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
