12/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 424 4695: Edoofa is a platform for student to persue higher education in INdia through scolarship and internship and it will be  mostly appreciated if i be part of it
12/01/24, 1:07 pm - Arshita: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend  *Persistance* who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
