I learned that Edoofa  program is a partial scholarship that helps many students who couldn't afford to fulfill thay dreams .Being part of Edoofa also teaches people to value hardwork , skill development and never gibing up. Also that the EWYL program has been of great help to many students as they can self finance themselves.

I am a hardworking , intelligent and  a fast thinker . I make sure that in everything I do I put all my focus and excel in it .
I believe that the edoofa scholarship is targeting all the intelligent students so that they can excel and I do believe I'm one of those students.
