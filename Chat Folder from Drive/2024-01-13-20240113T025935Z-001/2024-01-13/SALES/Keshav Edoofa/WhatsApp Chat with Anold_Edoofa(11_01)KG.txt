12/01/24, 8:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: So we must continue with your application then

Alright, so Anold, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Isheanesu, is that correct?
12/01/24, 8:34 am - +263 77 283 7739: Yes that is correct
12/01/24, 8:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great
12/01/24, 8:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Isheanesu, also do tell me whether you learnt about Isheanesu’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/01/24, 8:40 am - +263 77 283 7739: Isheanesu introduced me to the Edoofa program right. He told how he had undergone several counseling sessions and then interviews to dertemine whether he was well deserving of a scholarship.He also incouraged me to do the same and emphasized how easy the procedure was
12/01/24, 8:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Well, thats great to know Anold!

Indeed our procedure is easy to follow provided you and your parents connect and follow me throughout the session!
12/01/24, 8:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now let me brief you further about Edoofa and our Scholarship Program
12/01/24, 8:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/01/24, 8:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/01/24, 8:44 am - +263 77 283 7739: We will try our best to follow throughout
12/01/24, 8:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/01/24, 8:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/01/24, 8:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad to know that!
12/01/24, 8:47 am - +263 77 283 7739: Thats a tough road
12/01/24, 8:49 am - +263 77 283 7739: That is great
12/01/24, 8:50 am - +263 77 283 7739: That is absolutely correct
12/01/24, 8:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: Don't worry I am here to guide you through your counseling session and make sure you secure your scholarship seat in our Edoofa Program
12/01/24, 8:52 am - +263 77 283 7739: Thank you very much
12/01/24, 8:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great Anold
12/01/24, 8:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Anold, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/01/24, 8:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/01/24, 8:55 am - +263 77 283 7739: I think i will play my part and try as best i can
12/01/24, 8:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Amazing to know that Anold
12/01/24, 8:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Anold, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
12/01/24, 9:04 am - +263 77 283 7739: My name is Anold Chipato, i do not have a middle name that is. I completed my Grade 7 in 2017 at Lewisam primary school with 6 units out of a minimum of 5.
12/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 77 283 7739: I then completed my Olevel at St Francis of Assisi in 2021 with 7 A's and 6 B's and i continued to Alevel. I returned to Assisi for my Alevel which i recently just completed and still waiting for the results
12/01/24, 9:08 am - +263 77 283 7739: To my own perspective, i am an average student who prefers a challenge to everything. This therefore pushed me to dream higher than most. I hope to study Astronomy or at the least Astrophysics and aeronautics
12/01/24, 9:12 am - +263 77 283 7739: I am a fast learner given a persistent teacher. I am self driven and motivated. I have a high self esteem and belief in myself.I think those are some of my strengths.
For my weaknesses, i am  slow at acting and i prefer a more subtle approach to things. I am a very short person and that has led to me hating being looked down upon, which may cause me to outburst in very intense situations.
12/01/24, 9:18 am - +263 77 283 7739: I have many hobbies. I could spend the whole day telling you about them so I'll just have to generalise. I love sporting activities as a hobby. Things that keep me active and fit all the time. I play hockey, volleyball, cricket, basketball, tennis and i am also a great swimmer. This would pose a weird definition of character since i like active sports as well as non active practises too. I love playong chess and i am an artist, give me a pencil and paper and i could portray you in 30 minutes. I also love singing, i was a part of the school choir and this has been a beautiful experience
12/01/24, 9:24 am - +263 77 283 7739: My family background is not that pleasant. It would seem exagerated from your point of view, but this is the truth. My family is a low income earning family and all that my parents work for is immediately transfered to tuitions and school fees for me and my other  3 siblings. This will then mean that there is usually no surplus to cater for clothing, even the food is sometimes scarce but my parents work extra hard to provide food and transport costs. We live in a small cramped up space wher we fit the little that we have and share the two room as best we can. We all have a hope that education is going to be our salvation someday somehow.
12/01/24, 9:25 am - +263 77 283 7739: Both my parents are cuvil servants and they work at Government institutions. My father works at the University of Zimbabwe as a chef and my mother works at my previous primary school Lewisam Primary.
12/01/24, 9:26 am - +263 77 283 7739: Their field of work is basically the education sector of Zimbabwe i think, since they both work at educational institutions
12/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 77 283 7739: I think thats it.
12/01/24, 9:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Anold. Your determination to excel in your studies is truly commendable and reflects a strong sense of responsibility toward securing a bright future for yourself and your family. Your commitment to academic success is not only a testament to your personal growth but also a source of inspiration for those around you. By prioritizing education, you are actively shaping a path toward a prosperous future, showcasing resilience and a forward-looking mindset. Your efforts to uplift your family through education are both noble and impactful, and they resonate with the values of hard work and dedication! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!
12/01/24, 9:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am also amazed by your hobbies and extracurricular talent
12/01/24, 9:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: As you mentioned you have 3 siblings, can you shed some more light on what they do ?
12/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 77 283 7739: Thank you very much for that
12/01/24, 9:43 am - +263 77 283 7739: I do what makes me feel happy
12/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 77 283 7739: Though i have previously indicated that my parents struggle in their fields of work, they don not tolerate any disruptions to their children's education.
12/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 283 7739: My elder brother, Absolom is currently pursuing a course in Telecommunication at a college called Telone centre for learning.
12/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 283 7739: Due to the high tuotion and fees requirements, my younger siblings have been forced to attend affordable local day schools in order to complete their education
12/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 283 7739: My brother, Gabriel who is 15 is learning at Southlea high school and is doing his form 3
12/01/24, 10:00 am - Keshav Edoofa: Mr Albert and Mrs Thabitha are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and their dedication to your well-being is truly admirable!
12/01/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: So, could you kindly tell me how much *St Francis High School* charges you every term, and who in your family has financially supported your education till now, and who is going to support your higher education?
12/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 283 7739: At the same time my sister, Abigail is attending the ame school as Gabriel, that is Southlea high school and she just recently finished her grade 7 and is doing her form 1
12/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 283 7739: St Francis os Assisi charged an average of about US$400 every term. Despite the odds my parents were still the only ones who funded me through this period. They will continue to fund me in my tertiary education if i fail to acquire a scholarship
12/01/24, 10:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: Duly Noted Anold
12/01/24, 10:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is really amazing to know about your parents being behind you and supporting you in your education throughout these years
12/01/24, 10:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: We both will work throughout this session towards getting you a scholarship in our Edoofa program
12/01/24, 10:28 am - +263 77 283 7739: Thank you very much. The scholarship will remove a great load on parents' shoulders
12/01/24, 10:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: As you mentioned you would like to study Aerospace engineering I would like to know what motivated you to pursue this course for your higher education?
12/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 77 283 7739: Ever since i was a young child, i was very fond of the stars. I always wanted to explore deep into space and learn more about nebuli and the cosmos. " If only i were Elin Musk," i would think to myself. I thought it was impossible, but i then decided never to give up. I have ever since grown fond of the adventure the galaxies had in store for me.
12/01/24, 10:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: That are some awsome thoughts Anold , I am very pleased to know about your dreams and never giving up attitude!

So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
12/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 283 7739: No, noone has pursued that field before.
12/01/24, 10:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Oliver
12/01/24, 10:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: So have you researched about the aerospace engineering course and why it will be suitable to you?
12/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 77 283 7739: I have researched about it. Its not very wise of me i presume, but it has not been a question of why it is suitable for me, but it has always been about doing the things i love the most and earning from those things.
12/01/24, 11:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: I can understand Anold, you are very determined to achieve your goals and here I am absolutely standing with you to help you achieve them!
12/01/24, 11:02 am - +263 77 283 7739: Thank you very much
12/01/24, 11:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about *Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering*?

12/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 283 7739: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 283 7739: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you Anold for sharing your results
12/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 77 283 7739: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
12/01/24, 11:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: Its okay anold
12/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 283 7739: That's reassuring
12/01/24, 11:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you now please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/01/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 283 7739: There are a couple of reasons. First of all Zimbabwe is not quite well known for its adequate practical approach to learning and that demotivated me. Furthermore, the universities in Zimbabwe have a limited and sometimes no admissions for courses in my field of interest.
12/01/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 283 7739: The other reason is just that i want exposure the world outside of Zimbabwe since i could work there in the near future
12/01/24, 12:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I appreciate your insights Anold, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
