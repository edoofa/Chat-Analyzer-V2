Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now,we accept upto 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregrate of 35,this would be the maxumum limit for eligibility.All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program
04/01/24, 12:25 pm - Kunal: The minimum requirement was higher pre pandemic but during the pandemic a lot of students failed to recieve enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements has been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about Dan meeting the requirements and perform well in MSCE!
04/01/24, 1:05 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 2:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

05/01/24, 10:28 am - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued about your child to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on Dan's career?
05/01/24, 10:44 am - +265 999 36 24 22: It is a fact that should Dan acquire his studies in India, this would open up his career prospects considering the good track record India has in offering quality tertiary education.
05/01/24, 10:56 am - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
05/01/24, 11:02 am - +265 999 36 24 22: I have no idea
05/01/24, 11:02 am - +265 999 36 24 22: We wish to share
05/01/24, 11:03 am - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/01/24, 11:03 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 11:03 am - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
05/01/24, 12:34 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.

It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/01/24, 2:16 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/01/24, 2:16 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

05/01/24, 2:33 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: EWYL program is gives a great opportunity to a student to have support towards his tuition while at the same time gaining work experience.
05/01/24, 2:33 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:33 pm - Kunal: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
05/01/24, 2:39 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: This scenario looks very encouraging,
05/01/24, 2:46 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
05/01/24, 2:46 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
05/01/24, 2:46 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
05/01/24, 2:46 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most

05/01/24, 2:57 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Point 3
05/01/24, 2:58 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

05/01/24, 2:58 pm - Kunal: Indeed it is!
There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Dan with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/01/24, 3:32 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Myself as a parent
05/01/24, 3:38 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
05/01/24, 3:39 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: I feel great and this will bring great joy to our family
05/01/24, 3:39 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at even a greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
05/01/24, 3:39 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
05/01/24, 3:43 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Thanks for the information
05/01/24, 3:43 pm - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 4:03 pm - Kunal: shall we proceed?
05/01/24, 4:24 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Okay
05/01/24, 4:26 pm - Kunal: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their MSCE result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final MSCE results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
05/01/24, 4:26 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
05/01/24, 4:26 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
05/01/24, 4:29 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Iam following
05/01/24, 4:29 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 4:51 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Okay, may Iseek your permission to continue this with you tomorrow on a convenient time you may choose?
05/01/24, 4:51 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that we are about to finish the session, I would suggest you to complete it
05/01/24, 4:52 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Alright
05/01/24, 4:52 pm - Kunal: Please address this
05/01/24, 4:53 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Are we at Stage 4?
05/01/24, 4:53 pm - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
05/01/24, 4:54 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Thanks
05/01/24, 4:54 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
05/01/24, 4:54 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
05/01/24, 4:54 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
05/01/24, 4:56 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Noted thanks
05/01/24, 4:56 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

08/01/24, 2:35 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that
Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
08/01/24, 2:36 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Not as yet
08/01/24, 2:36 pm - Kunal: That is fine, 

May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
08/01/24, 2:46 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: What is it that is required , could you summarize?
08/01/24, 2:48 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: I might have forgotten some information
08/01/24, 2:55 pm - Kunal: Alright Mr Moses
Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 


This cost can be further reduced by you through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
08/01/24, 2:55 pm - Kunal: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family <This message was edited>
08/01/24, 2:56 pm - Kunal: Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on the performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.
08/01/24, 4:12 pm - Kunal: @265999362422 May I know if you are clear?
08/01/24, 4:30 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Yes this is appreciated.
08/01/24, 4:41 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that, Mr Moses
Can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will he/she be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
08/01/24, 4:56 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: 1. Course: Businesses Management 
2. Country of study: India (Is  there anywhere else?).
3. 2000 - 3000 USD?
4: 2000 - 3000 USD

08/01/24, 5:03 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Okay

Shall we proceed?
12/01/24, 7:58 am - Kunal: Greetings Mr Moses

I hope you're well. I've been anticipating your feedback after you reviewed the letter from the Program Director. Your response is crucial, as it represents your support for this unique opportunity, which will provide your child with affordable, quality higher education and valuable employability skills.

Please keep in mind that many other families and deserving candidates are awaiting counselling and evaluation sessions, and we need to allocate slots for them. *To ensure the process proceeds smoothly, we kindly request your feedback by today (12/01/2024) otherwise, the application will be put on hold which can lead to losing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.* If you have any challenges, do not hesitate to share, you can feel free to open up and I will be guiding you further.
12/01/24, 8:03 am - +265 999 36 24 22: This well noted
12/01/24, 8:04 am - Kunal: How are you doing, Mr Moses?
12/01/24, 8:31 am - +265 999 36 24 22: Iam fine ,  how are you. I have gone through the letter from the Academic Head and have well understood the content. May suggest we put this process on hold until Dan’s Exams this coming June. At time, we as family, will be comfortable to make informed decisions/commitments other than now.
12/01/24, 9:49 am - Kunal: I understand, Mr Moses
As you know, students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Malawians, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for the Central African students. At the same time, the day scholars are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out.
12/01/24, 9:50 am - Kunal: *So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Dan?*
12/01/24, 10:01 am - +265 999 36 24 22: Thanks Mr Kabul, we would rather engage with you after crossing  the examination bridge. We are very appreciative for your support and wish to continue with you anytime soon.
12/01/24, 10:09 am - Kunal: This is well noted, you can let me know once your child is done with the MSCE level and can check with me weather the scholarship seats are available then
12/01/24, 12:06 pm - +265 999 36 24 22: Thank you very much for your understanding Mr Kunal, it has been such a pleasure talking to you, I will surely revert to you when that time arises.
