I would also like to inform you that the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough for resources and study materials, due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting. Therefore, after the evaluations, the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
01/09/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 380 4576: I am working towards achieving it and im confident

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
01/09/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 380 4576: How is it done
01/09/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 380 4576: That can work thank you

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/09/23, 8:16 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
01/09/23, 8:16 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
01/09/23, 8:16 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
01/09/23, 8:16 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
01/09/23, 8:16 pm - Kunal: *Webinars: -*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
01/09/23, 8:16 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
01/09/23, 8:16 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 8:16 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
01/09/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 380 4576: I like the idea of the EWYL
01/09/23, 8:19 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
01/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 380 4576: I understand. This works
01/09/23, 8:25 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
01/09/23, 8:25 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
01/09/23, 8:25 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
01/09/23, 8:25 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
01/09/23, 8:27 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *10:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will ne available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!

*“Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions.” ―Dalai Lama XIV*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
02/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 380 4576: A pleasant morning
02/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 380 4576: Yes
02/09/23, 10:30 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
02/09/23, 10:30 am - Kunal: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
02/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 380 4576: 3
02/09/23, 10:31 am - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

02/09/23, 10:32 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
02/09/23, 10:32 am - +263 78 380 4576: My mother
02/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 380 4576: This is good
02/09/23, 10:36 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
02/09/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 380 4576: They are happy and willing to support me
02/09/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 380 4576: Yes we have been discussing everything
02/09/23, 10:43 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
02/09/23, 10:43 am - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
02/09/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 380 4576: So on the statement of purpose. Should I write on paper or type here
02/09/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 380 4576: And on the letter of recommendation. Should It be from the school authorities or...
02/09/23, 10:48 am - Kunal: Let me tell you more
02/09/23, 10:48 am - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
02/09/23, 10:48 am - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/09/23, 10:48 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/09/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 380 4576: Okay I see
02/09/23, 10:53 am - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
02/09/23, 10:54 am - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
02/09/23, 10:54 am - Kunal: However NAME, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/09/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 380 4576: Okay lets see if we can make it
02/09/23, 10:57 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/09/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 380 4576: And how do we pay
02/09/23, 10:58 am - Kunal: For your convenience,there are different modes of payment for *enrollment fee*

1) The direct international bank transfer to our organization's account
2) The payment through the FBC bank of our associate partner in Zimbabwe
3) Through PayPal if you have an international debit card or credit card

And these will be explained in detail later in the stages
02/09/23, 10:58 am - Kunal: You may address this
02/09/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 380 4576: We are at stage 4 if i am not mistaken
02/09/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 380 4576: Okay good
02/09/23, 11:00 am - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
02/09/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 380 4576: Yes
02/09/23, 11:14 am - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
02/09/23, 11:14 am - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
02/09/23, 11:14 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
02/09/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 380 4576: Yes thanks for the clarity
02/09/23, 11:34 am - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
02/09/23, 11:34 am - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

I am very well, Tadiwanashe
03/09/23, 8:57 pm - Austin: May I know did you managed to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
03/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 380 4576: Yes I did
03/09/23, 8:59 pm - Austin: So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
03/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 380 4576: So i had to discuss with the family. Told them about the program including the fees etc. They are happy about it
03/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 380 4576: The most important issue was on the fees as you know here in Zimbabwe the economy is not stable
03/09/23, 9:15 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 380 4576: Morning
04/09/23, 9:30 am - Austin: Greetings Mrs Chiunya and Tadiwanashe,
How are you doing?
04/09/23, 9:30 am - Austin: This message was deleted
04/09/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 380 4576: We are good
04/09/23, 9:49 am - Austin: Good to hear that, Tadiwanashe! <This message was edited>
04/09/23, 9:49 am - Austin: I do understand!
So may I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
04/09/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 380 4576: It's a bit expensive for us but they are willing to try
04/09/23, 10:20 am - Austin: Which cost does your family feels to be expensive?
04/09/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 380 4576: Registration
04/09/23, 10:26 am - Austin: As per your understanding, how much is the registration fees?
04/09/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 380 4576: This one
04/09/23, 11:36 am - Austin: The registration fee($500-$750) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

As discussed earlier the cost of education ranges between $2000-$3000 which includes the registration fee too.
04/09/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 380 4576: Okay okay i understand sir. Lets proceed
04/09/23, 11:39 am - +263 78 380 4576: Good. We like it
04/09/23, 11:41 am - Austin: So in the counselling session, we discussed the importance of Application forms, SOP, and then we have University Sessions, the Earn While You Learn Program, visa assistance, and all services for which the cost is cut down making the enrollment fee reduced to $350 which can be paid either in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining $150 in 30 days) or together

If you are eligible for the program, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within 7 days after receiving the Acceptance Letter?
04/09/23, 11:44 am - +263 78 380 4576: For now to be honest no. But we'll let you know if we have it
04/09/23, 12:05 pm - Austin: This message was deleted
04/09/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 380 4576: We can proceed and find solutions after the sessions
04/09/23, 12:10 pm - Austin: The next stage is your eligibility check and we will need your family to be prepared for the same before proceeding
04/09/23, 12:11 pm - Austin: So may I know, how much time will your family require raise the enrollment fee?
04/09/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 380 4576: By the end of the month
04/09/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 380 4576: Okay
04/09/23, 12:39 pm - Austin: That would be a long timeframe considering the rush of applicants Tadiwanashe. But considering your challenge, if I request a payment plan for you in such a way that you can pay $100 in 7 days and $100 by 25th if you qualify, will it be feasible for your family?
04/09/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 380 4576: Yes
04/09/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 380 4576: Thank you
04/09/23, 1:49 pm - Austin: Have you confirmed the same with your family?
04/09/23, 1:49 pm - Austin: I would appreciate it if your parent can acknowledge the same
04/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 380 4576: Yes all the things I've been saying are coming from my family
04/09/23, 2:07 pm - Austin: Noted Tadiwanashe
Is there anything you would like to ask me before we begin with the Eligibility Procedures?
04/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 380 4576: So when we get to India who's gonna be there to get me or us
04/09/23, 2:18 pm - Austin: Our team will be there at the airport to welcome and guide you to our Universities and our Department of Student Welfare will be a present at the Universities to guide you further with Accommodation and proceedings

04/09/23, 2:19 pm - Austin: *More than 200 Edoofians were welcomed at the airport by our Edoofa team last month*. The numerous testimonials from countless students serve as a powerful testament to the effectiveness of this opportunity in enhancing students' employability skills, and overall education quality. *Have a look at our recent arrivals and we have many more batches of Edoofians arriving in the coming days*

We are witnessing this transition through the Edoofa Scholarship Program and *we look forward to you being a part of this community of achievers*
04/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 380 4576: Okay thank you
04/09/23, 2:30 pm - Austin: You are welcome, are you having other questions for me?

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.

a) enfeeble
b) thriving

04/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 380 4576: Section 5 : many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient because farming is the main sector in the economy of African countries. They focus mainly in Agriculture and is their lifeline. For axample In a country like Zimbabwe if there is no much crop enough in the farm this means that you are going to have nothing to put on the table to eat. Africans tend to have a large number of people in their families so their farms will be insufficient to feed their families and proving to be in efficient. In Africa high levels of rain are experienced so this causes water to be flooded and stagnant. This means that the crops will decay and therefore leading to poor diets. However there are other factors which leads to Africans having poor diets which are lack of income.Less money means that they won't have money to purchase food for a proper diet and will eat what is affordable. The other factor is lack of knowledge. The people might have the money but does not have the knowledge on how to set up a healthy and good diet. Therefore it is to a lesser extent that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient
04/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 380 4576: Section 6: In 2017, the news came when i was at school. The news was about my father dying. It was  the year i was preparing for my grade 7 examinations. The news came in the late months. I was really affected by the news to such extent that my heart skipped a beat once. I was at a tender age for these news. Two weeks were left for the exams to start. The burial and all the process took up to one week and 3 days because he had died in Kenya. It was just too much pressure for me to prepare for exams. We went and buried him but there was no much time left. It was a very difficult situation and time for me but i managed to use the little time i had to prepare. I wrote my exam and passed in the melancholic state i was.                                                   My story is for inspirating people to work hard to get what they want no matter the circumstances
