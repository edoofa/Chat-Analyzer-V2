It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*

10/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 782 8606: Studying in India can be a great way to advance your career and gain new skills and knowledge. The country has a wide range of educational institutions, from world-renowned universities to smaller, more specialized schools. Many international students choose to study in India because of the opportunity to gain hands-on experience and to work with experts in their field.

l want to archieve my career aspiration through studying law and working very hard so that l gain much skills and became more equipped in my industrial career
10/01/24, 2:14 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
10/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 78 782 8606: no l'm not
10/01/24, 2:42 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
10/01/24, 2:42 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 2:43 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
10/01/24, 2:58 pm - +263 78 782 8606: no
10/01/24, 2:59 pm - Kunal: I understand
Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
10/01/24, 2:59 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

10/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 782 8606: yes l think l will
10/01/24, 3:00 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
10/01/24, 3:00 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
10/01/24, 3:07 pm - +263 78 782 8606: okay
10/01/24, 3:23 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
10/01/24, 3:25 pm - +263 78 782 8606: the 4th point is the most important
10/01/24, 3:26 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
10/01/24, 5:10 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 9:51 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone

*“Always turn a negative situation into a positive situation.”*

On a positive note, I am here to resume the session
Shall we proceed?
11/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 78 782 8606: yes
11/01/24, 10:35 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
11/01/24, 10:35 am - Kunal: Please address this
11/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 78 782 8606: my parents
11/01/24, 10:45 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
11/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 782 8606: l was hoping to get a fully funded scholarship
11/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 782 8606: they feel great
11/01/24, 11:00 am - Kunal: Joseph, you are aware from the beginning that this is not a full funded scholarship
As you know, Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family
11/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 782 8606: yes
11/01/24, 11:17 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
11/01/24, 11:17 am - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
11/01/24, 1:36 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
11/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 782 8606: yes we are
11/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 782 8606: no
11/01/24, 2:07 pm - Kunal: Let me guide you ahead
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

11/01/24, 2:53 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
11/01/24, 7:47 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 9:46 pm - +263 78 782 8606: okay
12/01/24, 8:19 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone
I hope you are having a wonderful day

I am here to begin with the session, shall we proceed?
12/01/24, 8:30 am - +263 78 782 8606: yes we can
12/01/24, 8:31 am - +263 78 782 8606: yes
12/01/24, 8:31 am - Kunal: Good morning, Joseph
How are you doing?
12/01/24, 8:32 am - Kunal: This message was deleted
12/01/24, 8:32 am - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
12/01/24, 8:32 am - +263 78 782 8606: l'm fine thanks and how are you
12/01/24, 8:32 am - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
12/01/24, 8:33 am - +263 78 782 8606: okay
12/01/24, 8:34 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 8:35 am - +263 78 782 8606: stage 3
12/01/24, 8:35 am - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
12/01/24, 8:36 am - +263 78 782 8606: yes
12/01/24, 8:36 am - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
12/01/24, 8:36 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
12/01/24, 8:37 am - +263 78 782 8606: yes
12/01/24, 8:49 am - Kunal: Alright Joseph, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-
