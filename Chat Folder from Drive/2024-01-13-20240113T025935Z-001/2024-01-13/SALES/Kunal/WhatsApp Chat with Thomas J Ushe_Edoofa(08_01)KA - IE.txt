10/01/24, 1:36 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
10/01/24, 1:59 pm - +27 67 740 7312: Yes l am confident about achieving it.
10/01/24, 2:06 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
10/01/24, 2:07 pm - Kunal: May I know with his interests in the field of Engineering, why didn't he opt for Physics at A level?
10/01/24, 2:41 pm - +27 67 740 7312: With the Zimbabwean education system when you get to A level you are not given the chance to choose what you want to do instead they choose for you .
10/01/24, 2:51 pm - Kunal: Since he is not having Physics at A level, he is not eligible for the field of engineering
May I know if he is having any alternate career aspiration?
10/01/24, 3:05 pm - +27 67 740 7312: Quantity surveying
10/01/24, 3:06 pm - Kunal: Well noted
Based on my evaluation, considering his subjects and passion in Quantity Surveyor, he is eligible for

11/01/24, 10:59 am - +27 67 740 7312: Quite interesting to know all of this ,thank you.
11/01/24, 11:16 am - Kunal: Indeed, can you now tell me? 

How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your child’s career?
11/01/24, 11:49 am - +27 67 740 7312: Studying with the renowned institution in India is going to help him get the best quality education that will obviously help him get the best knowledge of what he inspire  to do in his career.
11/01/24, 11:56 am - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
11/01/24, 12:42 pm - +27 67 740 7312: No idea about the cost quality higher education for an international student within scholarship.
11/01/24, 12:45 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/01/24, 12:45 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 12:45 pm - Kunal: *The Bachelor of Planning (B. Plan)* program is available in select universities, contributing to its limited scholarship opportunities. The program incurs a higher cost of education, ranging from *$2700 to $3700 per annum.* This comprehensive fee covers tuition, accommodation, food, and essential amenities such as WiFi, laundry, and library fees. The payment structure consists of two equal installments, each settled before the commencement of a semester. With two semesters in a year, this financial arrangement facilitates a smoother and more manageable academic journey.

*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
11/01/24, 1:25 pm - +27 67 740 7312: Yes it's affordable.
11/01/24, 1:27 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/01/24, 1:27 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

11/01/24, 2:28 pm - +27 67 740 7312: The EWYLP is a good program it helps in the overall growth of the child because the student is given real time projects where he gain work experience while getting opportunity to earn scholarship credits that are equivalent to physical cash. The credits can be used to for part of his education fees, which is very excellent.
11/01/24, 2:29 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 2:29 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
11/01/24, 2:46 pm - +27 67 740 7312: It helps lot
11/01/24, 2:47 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
11/01/24, 3:21 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
11/01/24, 3:36 pm - +27 67 740 7312: Yes we are connected
11/01/24, 3:38 pm - Kunal: Please address this
11/01/24, 3:41 pm - +27 67 740 7312: I think they are all important because each of them plays a significant roll in  the success of the student
11/01/24, 3:43 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program very well
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

11/01/24, 3:44 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
11/01/24, 3:55 pm - +27 67 740 7312: No one is going to help me l will be responsible for the remaining fees.
11/01/24, 4:02 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
11/01/24, 4:06 pm - +27 67 740 7312: I feel very happy because I know he is going to get the best education.
11/01/24, 4:14 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at even a greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
11/01/24, 4:14 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
11/01/24, 4:49 pm - +27 67 740 7312: Can please send the website address where he can access the online forms for applying.
11/01/24, 7:50 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 8:20 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone
I hope you are having a wonderful day

I am here to begin with the session, shall we proceed?
12/01/24, 8:21 am - +27 67 740 7312: Good morning. Yes we can proceed
12/01/24, 8:24 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
12/01/24, 8:24 am - Kunal: Let me guide you ahead
12/01/24, 8:24 am - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
12/01/24, 8:24 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 8:31 am - +27 67 740 7312: Yes please
12/01/24, 8:48 am - Kunal: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
12/01/24, 8:48 am - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
12/01/24, 8:48 am - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
12/01/24, 9:09 am - +27 67 740 7312: Thanks wonderful
12/01/24, 9:21 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 9:30 am - +27 67 740 7312: I think we've discussed everything from personalized counselling sessions to admission letter and visa.
12/01/24, 9:30 am - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
12/01/24, 9:32 am - +27 67 740 7312: Yes
12/01/24, 9:33 am - Kunal: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
12/01/24, 9:33 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
12/01/24, 9:36 am - +27 67 740 7312: Yes lam clear with the process
12/01/24, 9:45 am - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision.
