09/01/24, 1:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263783486929 Please understand that my time and assistance require a lot of effort from my end as well. Being one of the senior counsellors who have been assisting the students for the past 5 years, I have loads of other student applications to attend to. I regularly take out time from my  schedule to assist you

So with the utmost respect, please try to reciprocate the same energy by which I am assisting you.

Otherwise, If you do not wish to continue then that is a different matter altogether. you can update me on the same so that I can provide a formal closure to your application

11/01/24, 7:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
12/01/24, 4:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hi, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
