What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
Edoofa is a good scholarship which helps students by providing from 50percent to 100percent payment of fees or even acomodation.
It also helps in making the the students more skilful and also it helps the student's social life as they interact with other organisations.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? Because when i heard about the Edoofa program i thought as much it can help me to fulfil my dream to become a doctor.
Moreover, empowering me to a stonger personal, cultural and eduactional growth.
