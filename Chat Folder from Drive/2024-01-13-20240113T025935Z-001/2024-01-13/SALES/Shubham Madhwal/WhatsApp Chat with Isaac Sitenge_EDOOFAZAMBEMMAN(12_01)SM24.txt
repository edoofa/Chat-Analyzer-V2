12/01/24, 12:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
12/01/24, 12:04 pm - +260 96 0361434: I have read and almost fully understood the Frequently Asked Questions PDF and therefore I understand that it is not a charity but rather closer to a loan
12/01/24, 12:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please
12/01/24, 12:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
12/01/24, 12:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
12/01/24, 12:37 pm - +260 96 0361434: I understand
12/01/24, 12:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls.
12/01/24, 12:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Eoodfa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.
With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..
12/01/24, 12:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia
12/01/24, 12:51 pm - +260 96 0361434: So am I to understand that you are no longer accepting 2023 examination candidates?
12/01/24, 1:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

12/01/24, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mr and Mrs Ulaya
I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?

We have been following the conversation with interest.

We are guardians to Isaac and we wish him to get the best education we can afford to give him.

I am an accountant by profession studied in Zambia and did break out courses in South Africa and India.

My wife is a nurse and studied in Zambia and did her additional studies to a Master degree in the UK.

Isaac wishes to study medicine and while we are waiting for his results, we are looking for best options for him to achieve his dreams.

So clear guidance for what you offer will help in our plans going forward. <This message was edited>

12/01/24, 4:01 pm - +260 96 0361434: I had a tough time deciding between medicine and engineering. I picked medicine because I believe it will better enable me to be of greater service to my country and the world.My native country Zambia has a very weak medical system and as such my people always have to travel abroad to seek medical attention. I believe that I could make a difference to my country's medical system and give it India's famous medical standard. I want to increase Zambia's life expectancy to far above 40 years
