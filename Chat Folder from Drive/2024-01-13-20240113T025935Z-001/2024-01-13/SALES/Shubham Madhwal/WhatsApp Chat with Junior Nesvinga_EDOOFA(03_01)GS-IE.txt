03/01/24, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Tapiwanashe who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
03/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 71 250 1277: He did. He'd stipulated a (50-100)% quantum.
03/01/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Junior, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 



In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
03/01/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, I think you will adhere to the above two quantifiers. Do you have any limitations that may hinder you and your Parents from being online for at least TWO-THREE hours today?
03/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 71 250 1277: My mom will be available but my father is usually working throughout the entirety of the day, so he's barely ever free.
03/01/24, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: Now Junior, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
03/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you Mr. Gurvinder. In about a month's worth of time, my highest qualification will be Ordinary levels, I have already sat for them in the November 2023 session of the ZIMSEC examination council and I'm waiting for the publication of the results. I was hoping to pursue courses in finance and business management (I'm not exactly sure of the courses offered, but that's the field). My father is a security manager at Zialandia Mine in Midlands Zimbabwe and my mother is an Event Planner. My parents highest educational level is Ordinary levels. My parents have been supporting my education so far. I'm hoping the scholarship would be able to support my finances if I get the opportunity to study abroad. I have 3 siblings, the oldest William is a confectioner at Spar supermarket in Cape Town South Africa, my sister, Mercy is an Office Manager working in her capacity as a secretary at a private boarding school in Chivhu called Livingproof High School and lastly, my brother, Praise who is also currently waiting for his final semester results for his BSc. Hons. in Applied Mathematics from the national university of science and technology. I was studying at Zvishavane High School in Midlands province at US$60.00 per term. <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know about you Junior.
03/01/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel like you have a close-knit family, so don't you think, your siblings should also be a part of this session?
03/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Indeed we're close-knit but my oldest brother's profession like my father's does not allow him to be on any social media platform during the day. My sister can be part of the procession. I am currently using my brother, Praise's phone, so him and I cannot be online at the same time.
03/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, can you please add your sister and ask her to introduce herself.
03/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Alright
03/01/24, 1:58 pm - ~ The Lorde™ added +263 77 700 8692
03/01/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 700 8692: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Mercy Nesvinga. I'm Junior's immediate older sister. I'm an office manager working in my capacity as a secretary at Livingproof High School in Chivhu Zimbabwe
03/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you Ms Nesvinga.
03/01/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study finance and business management, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
03/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 71 250 1277: For me, studying a course inline with finance and business management is about more than just earning a degree. It's about gaining the skills and knowledge that will allow me to succeed in an industry that is constantly changing and evolving. I am drawn to the challenge of working in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, and I am excited by the opportunities that this field offers. I also believe that business and finance have the potential to make a positive impact on the world, and I am eager to play a role in that. Ultimately, I am motivated by the prospect of making a difference in the world through my work as others who've come before me have. <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Your perspective on finance and business management is impressive. The dynamic nature of the industry excites you, and your passion for making a positive impact aligns perfectly with the opportunities this field offers. Your drive to contribute positively and make a difference through your work is commendable and reflects a deep understanding of the field's potential impact.
03/01/24, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
03/01/24, 2:35 pm - +263 71 250 1277: My mom is an event planner and despite not having been part of the actual finance and business management field, she has highly motivated my desire to pursue the field. Her work ethic and overall perspective and appreciation of the financial world is quite quintessential to her overall success in her endeavours and that is the closest I have to any relations in the field.
03/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: It's great to hear about your inspiration from your mother's work ethic and her perspective on financial aspects, even if she's not directly in the finance and business management field. Sometimes, indirect influence can be just as impactful in shaping our aspirations and work ethics.
03/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
03/01/24, 3:02 pm - +263 71 250 1277: I'm still waiting for the results. I sat for my O Levels in November. The results haven't been published yet.
03/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Please share your term results then.

04/01/24, 9:28 am - +263 71 250 1277: Good morning Mr. Gurvinder
04/01/24, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: So have you taken a decision yet?
04/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 71 250 1277: I wanted to ask if it's only diplomas and not degrees on offer.
04/01/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Please do you want to do A-level?
04/01/24, 9:59 am - +263 71 250 1277: I didn't know degrees were only reserved for people with A-levels. 
I do concur on the proposal for a *Diploma in Business Administration*
04/01/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
04/01/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the program?
04/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 71 250 1277: I think i do now
04/01/24, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
04/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Five years after completing the *Diploma in Business Administration*, I envision myself working as a financial analyst or consultant especially in the context of my resident country that might have a viable market, helping organizations make informed decisions about their finances and operations. I believe that Edoofa's program in retrospect, would have made a financially improbable career choice a reality, having had provided me with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in my dream field of choice to employ imperative skills like financial modeling, data analysis, and project management. Additionally, the program's focus on international and cross-cultural learning will equip me to work in a global context and make a positive impact on organizations around the world. I also hope to continue learning and growing throughout my career, as I believe that lifelong learning is key to success.
04/01/24, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Junior I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
04/01/24, 12:43 pm - +263 71 250 1277: I definitely am.
04/01/24, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/01/24, 12:54 pm - +263 71 250 1277: There are several reasons why I would prefer to study abroad, rather than in my home country. Firstly, studying abroad provides a unique opportunity to immerse myself in a new culture and gain a global perspective. Secondly, the international setting afforded by Edoofa's program would expose me to a diverse range of ideas and experiences, broadening my knowledge and helping me to develop critical thinking skills. Thirdly, I believe that studying abroad will give me an edge in the job market, as employers increasingly seek candidates with global experience and understanding. Finally, I'm excited about the prospect of living and learning in a new country and having the opportunity to make new friends, experience new cultures, and explore new places. I believe that this experience will not only enhance my personal and professional development, but also enrich my life in ways I can't even imagine.
04/01/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 71 250 1277: If I were to receive this scholarship and have the opportunity to pursue my education abroad, I would hope to bring back the knowledge and skills I gained to help improve the education system in my home country. For instance, I would like to share my experiences with other students and encourage them to pursue international opportunities as well. I would also advocate for increased access to quality education and resources for students from all backgrounds. Additionally, I would like to help improve the curriculum and teaching methods in my country by incorporating innovative methods and tools that I learned during my time abroad. Overall, I would aim to use my experience to benefit my community and help others achieve their dreams by pursuing education abroad. I believe that sharing my story and offering advice and support to others can make a significant difference, and I would be honored to contribute in this way. With the right support and opportunities, I believe that anyone can achieve their goals and make a positive impact on their community.
04/01/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Junior, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
04/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Absolutely, I totally agree with your point that it's essential to have a supportive and conducive environment to achieve one's full potential.
04/01/24, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
04/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 71 250 1277: I understand that.
04/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 71 250 1277: However, I think it's important to look beyond that history and recognize the progress that India has made in the past few decades. Today, India is home to some of the top universities in the world, with world-class facilities and cutting-edge research. In addition, India offers a unique and vibrant culture that can be an enriching experience for international students. So, while it's true that India and Africa share a common history, I believe that India can offer a lot to students from all over the world including those like me from Zimbabwe
04/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
04/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

04/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 71 250 1277: This has definitely renewed my personal understanding of how India is such a great nation possibly the very best educational destination for international students like myself.
04/01/24, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: So now Junior, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
04/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you for the information. As of now, I do not have any questions.
04/01/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
04/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 71 250 1277: We had not researched the average weighted cost.
04/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
04/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/01/24, 2:06 pm - +263 71 250 1277: This is a best case scenario for someone like me. Thank you very much for the information.
04/01/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
04/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Yes, I'm very curious about that.
04/01/24, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Junior, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
04/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 71 250 1277: This sounds very good. I'd be very interested if I'm afforded the opportunity.
04/01/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/01/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
04/01/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

04/01/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
04/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 71 250 1277: I think it's really beneficial for students to have access to these kinds of insights and advice from industry professionals. It's not often that students get the chance to hear directly from those who have been successful in their fields, and the fact that the EWYL program provides that opportunity is a huge benefit. I also think it's important for students to start thinking about their careers early on, and the webinars can help them understand what they need to do to prepare for success. I think it's definitely something that would benefit me, as well as other students.
04/01/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Junior, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 71 250 1277: This is quite helpful.
04/01/24, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/01/24, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
04/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 71 250 1277: I think it's really impressive that the Edoofa program offers students the chance to earn scholarship credits based on their consistency and performance. It's a unique way to motivate students from countries like mine and help them take ownership of their education. I also like that the program is focused on helping students finance their own education, which is such an important goal for many people. I think the program is doing a great job of providing a holistic approach to higher education that really sets it apart from other institutions the world over.
04/01/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Junior, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
04/01/24, 2:44 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Yes they are
04/01/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
04/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 71 250 1277: I'd only suggested my desire to embark on the initiative to them, but I'd reserved the details to understand them from someone more knowledgeable and resourceful such as yourself.
04/01/24, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
04/01/24, 2:52 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Yes  I am
04/01/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Junior as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/01/24, 2:56 pm - +263 71 250 1277: If a student applies to five universities, they would likely spend between $1,500 and $2,250 on the application process.
04/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Junior, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/01/24, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 3:00 pm - +263 71 250 1277: I understand
04/01/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
04/01/24, 3:05 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Absolutely. I'm impressed by the program's guarantee of admission and scholarship, which takes a lot of the stress and uncertainty out of the application process. It's refreshing to see a program that puts the needs of students first.
04/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Junior basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
04/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
04/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 71 250 1277: I understand
04/01/24, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
04/01/24, 3:11 pm - +263 71 250 1277: No I'm not
04/01/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Junior, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
04/01/24, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 250 1277: I definitely understand now
04/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
04/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
04/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
04/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 250 1277: As of now I don't have any questions. I'd relay the information to done of my family who can't be part of the procession to see If they too have any questions.
04/01/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
04/01/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/01/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

04/01/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that tomorrow at 10 am, I will also be connecting with you and your family in this group, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
04/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 71 250 1277: I understand. I'll definitely inform them.
05/01/24, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: Hello @263776350616 @263712501277 @263777008692 .

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
05/01/24, 9:35 am - +263 71 250 1277: Good morning Mr. Gurvinder. Yes we are.
05/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 700 8692: Morning Mr Gurvinder. yes we are
05/01/24, 9:38 am - +263 77 635 0616: Good morning. This is Junior's mother. Thank you for involving us. We are ready for the eligibility check evaluation.
05/01/24, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.

So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
05/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 77 635 0616: I have been following, I've had a bit of difficulty understanding the scope of the scholarship. 
Is the scholarship quantum predetermined or is it afforded depending on the applicant?
When the applicant gets placement in any of the institutions, would the remainder of the tuition always be between US$3,000.00 and US$2,000.00 or it depends on the institution?
05/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 700 8692: I also wanted to ask on what constitutes the activities that count towards the credits Junior earns?
Are they part of or inline with the Diploma he'd be pursuing? Or is it something done outside of the usual academic hours?
05/01/24, 11:20 am - Gurvinder: Please the scholarship quantum depends on the counselling session, the test, and the interviews, the given cost of education is for a general idea for you parents so that you are clear about everything before the student comes to India.
05/01/24, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: Please the EWYL program gives projects that teach students skills that are job essentials and gives them an edge when companies come for the placement drive in the last year of every course to offer jobs.
05/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 700 8692: Okay
05/01/24, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: Is there any other concern?
05/01/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 635 0616: Alright, thank you.
If it was possible that Junior gets placement, when would the academic year start?
Does it start in August when we pay the first tuition deposit or in January next year?
05/01/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Please, it starts in August 2024.
05/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 77 635 0616: Thank you
05/01/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
05/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 77 635 0616: To be sure, the average cost of education after the scholarship ranges between US$2,000.00 and US$3,000.00 per year which includes tuition, basic expenses, food and accommodation. And in case of getting accepted, using the payment plan, a total of US$200.00 can be paid within the first 7 days and the remainder, US$150.00 to be paid in the remaining 30 days.
Is this right?
05/01/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
05/01/24, 1:32 pm - Gurvinder: So @263776350616, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @263712501277 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
05/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 635 0616: 1. Junior is going to be studying for a *Diploma in Business Administration* through the Edoofa Program.

2. Junior will be studying in India through the Edoofa Program.

3. The average cost of studies in India without a scholarship ranges between US$6,000.00 and US$8,000.00.

4. If found eligible for the program, the annual fee I would pay ranges between US$2,000.00 and US$3,000.00.

5. The enrollment fee for the Edoofa Program is US$350,00 to be paid within 7 days of being found eligible.

6. To my understanding, the Earn While You Learn Program helps students offset the cost of their higher education by providing scholarship credits based on the work they complete. To illustrate this concept, consider a student whose annual tuition is US$2,200.00 If this student earns US$100.00 per month in scholarship credits, they would effectively reduce their tuition cost to US$1,000.00 per year. This would bring the monthly cost for the student's education down to US$100.00 per month. There is no limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn, so the more they are willing to work, the more money they can save on their education.

7. I understand what item 7 is saying. <This message was edited>

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

05/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 635 0616: I understand that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is designed to help my child achieve their career goals and provide them with the financial resources they need to succeed. I appreciate the transparency and 
honesty of the program, including the four questions to consider before applying. I will take the time to carefully discuss these questions with my child and make sure we are both on the same page. I understand 
that this is a big decision and I want to make sure we are fully informed before moving forward. I particularly appreciated the four questions included in the document, as they gave me a lot of insight into the purpose and intention of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. The questions were well thought out and provided clear and concise information. I felt that the responses to the questions were equally well thought out and clear, making it easy to understand the program and its benefits. The advisory section at the end of the document was a great addition, as it reinforced the importance of thoughtful and careful consideration before enrolling in the Edoofa Scholarship Program. It also served as a reminder that this is a major decision that should not be taken lightly. I appreciated the fact that the program understands the importance of making an informed decision and that they are willing to help parents through the process. This demonstrates the program's commitment to the success of its students and their families, and I for one definitely appreciate that.

SECTION 5 ESSAY WRITING

TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?

 *In 1994, Rwanda was devastated by a genocide that killed over 800,000 people in just 100 days. Since then, the country has made significant strides in its recovery. The Rwandan genocide is a topic I've delved into in the recent past because of my involvement in my former school's debate and public speaking club. The motion was, "This House believes that Africa as a conglutination should address the genocides in the body's host nations".*

*Today, life in Rwanda is still very different from life in most other countries. I would like to explore how the country has changed since the genocide, including its economic growth, the reconstruction of its infrastructure, and the efforts to bring those responsible for the genocide to justice. I will also discuss the challenges that remain, such as poverty and a lack of resources. Overall, I will paint a picture of a country that has come a long way, but still has many challenges ahead.*

*Rwanda is still a developing country, and it faces issues such as poverty, lack of infrastructure, and lack of resources. These challenges will need to be addressed if the country is to continue to make progress and improve the lives of its people. The genocide was carried out by the Hutu-led government and was fueled by ethnic tensions that had been simmering for decades and to some extent, as of today, the perpetrators of the genocide have been brought to justice. In the years following the genocide, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was established to prosecute those responsible for the genocide.* 

*In addition, critics argue that the justice system in Rwanda is not independent and lacks due process but efforts have been made nonetheless. Rwanda's GDP (gross domestic product)was severely impacted by the genocide. In 1994, the GDP fell by around half it's initial value, and the economy was in ruins. However, in the years following the genocide, the country has made significant progress in rebuilding its economy. In the early 2000s, the government implemented a series of reforms. As a result, the country's GDP began to grow again, and by now, I'm sure it has recovered way past its pre-genocide level. Rwanda has experienced strong economic growth, with a steady upward rising annual GDP growth from the early 2000s till PRE-COVID-19 years.* 

*The country's economy is now more diversified, with a growing service sector and a focus on developing industries such as agriculture, tourism, and technology. However, despite the impressive economic growth, Rwanda remains a low-income country like my own country Zimbabwe, and the benefits of growth have not been evenly distributed. Poverty and inequality remain significant challenges, and the country still faces significant development challenges. The education system in Rwanda was also severely impacted by the genocide. Many schools were destroyed, and teachers and students were killed. In the aftermath of the genocide, the government made education a top priority, and enrollment rates have increased significantly. However, the quality of education remains a challenge, with a lack of qualified teachers and limited resources. In recent years, the government has implemented reforms to improve the quality of education, such as introducing a new curriculum and increasing teacher training. However, challenges remain, and the country still has a long way to go to improve educational outcomes for its citizens.* 

SECTION 6
PERSONALITY TEST
"My Inspirational Story"

 *As a 16-year-old boy, I have always been immensely grateful for the opportunities that I have been afforded throughout my life. My personal passions in fields of finance and competitive debating and public speaking have been an integral part of how I've conducted myself. These passions have helped shape who I am as a person and have given me a sense of purpose. One of the things that I find most inspiring is the ability of those around me and myself to overcome adversity. I have seen many examples of this throughout history too, such as Nelson Mandela's journey from prisoner to president of my neighboring country, South Africa. These stories have shown me that it is possible to overcome any obstacle if you have the dedication, perseverance, and a willingness to work hard. This is something that I strive to embody in my own life, and it has helped me to achieve my goals so far. I believe that having an open mind is essential for success. This allows me to learn from different perspectives and to see the world in a new way. I am also a proud Christian, and my faith has been a source of strength and guidance in my life. It has taught me the importance of love, compassion, and forgiveness. Finally, I believe that an optimistic outlook is key to living a fulfilling life. No matter what challenges I face, I try to stay positive and look for the silver lining. I believe that there is always a way to turn a difficult situation into an opportunity for growth. By approaching life with optimism and determination, I believe that anything is possible. I am grateful for all of the opportunities that I have been given and for the ability to pursue my passions. I believe that with hard work, an open mind, and a positive attitude, I can achieve my goals and live a life that is meaningful and fulfilling.* <This message was edited>

11/01/24, 8:53 am - +263 77 635 0616: Yes

11/01/24, 8:59 am - +263 77 635 0616: For the mean time I don't have any questions but they may arise in due course. Thank you.
11/01/24, 9:03 am - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentioned in Junior's acceptance letter?
11/01/24, 9:06 am - +263 77 635 0616: The first installment of the payment plan for the enrollment fee of US$200.00 should be paid by 16 January 2024 and the remaining US$150.00 should be paid by 15 February 2024
11/01/24, 9:09 am - Shubham Madhwal: And are you aware  of the transaction methods as well?
11/01/24, 9:12 am - +263 77 635 0616: I am. I had figured it would be easier to make the payment through the associated school Hartzell High School, ex-principal Mr. Shorwi Kawadza.
11/01/24, 9:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
11/01/24, 9:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738
11/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Good afternoon Mr. Madhwal, the first US$200.00 deposit has been made.
11/01/24, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you share the  transaction slip with me?
11/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 71 250 1277: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 12:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please!
11/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 71 250 1277: Thank you
