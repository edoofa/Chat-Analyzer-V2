09/01/24, 4:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
09/01/24, 4:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

I'm a 22year old girl who has always been motivated by my background. I'm hard working and determined to reach high level in life. I have always had a passion in the health sector,my dream is to be pharmacist and a lab technician. This comes from my desire to help make  the world a better place for everyone despite different social classes, by working towards administration of medical aid to all. I always embrace learning and exploring different trades because I believe learning and education is a life time process which goes beyond having a certificate.My highest level of education is Advanced level. I studied literature in English, History and Family Religious Studies and had 12points .My mother is a hairdresser by profession and her highest level of education is Ordinary level.My mother and my relatives have been supportive in my journey of education and they will be supporting me financially for my higher education abroad as well. I have a younger sister who is doing her ordinary level. I studied at Hartzell high school located in Manicaland province.For my Advances level my per-term fees was 510US dollars

11/01/24, 4:11 pm - +263 77 134 5675: Okay the previous school I studied at which is Hartzell high school helped me grow not only academically but also socially and mentally.Through guidance and counseling sessions we had I got to learn different aspects of life like how to fit in with people from different backgrounds,how to adapt and adopt to different lifestyles and boosting my self confidence. It also helped me boost myself esteem since I had no confidence and was always shy and afraid of trying new things and associates with others .My previous school also helped me physically as I was not a sport person but at Hartzell I got to explore different sporting activities like handball and soccer. Academically, my previous school gave us a friendly learning environment which made education more enjoyable and easy going.  Overall Hartzell high made me want to learn more because it helped me unlock and open up more than I ever knew I could . It made me believe I can do anything and become anything I want in life through hard work and determination

Thank you for the encouraging words 
We can continue with the session
12/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 134 5675: My mom went to work and she is currently unavailable I think she is tired up

12/01/24, 10:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to pharmacist and a lab technician, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
12/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 77 134 5675: I have always had  this passion in helping people in various ways and having a positive impact in people's lives . For the past few years we have experienced anumber of pandemic like coronavirus and Ebola which took many precious lives .To me those hard experiences drew me closer to wanting to explore more on how we can find cure or even prevention from such infections.Also during my Olevel I lost a friend due to blood pressure and diabetes which only came to light after she was already no more ,it made me more interested in wanting to know what happenes to the human body , how does one get such diseases, what needs to be done to avoid it and how to go about checking on your health, getting tested and getting treated.Also my father there some  diseases which later came to light after his passing on which he was never tested or get any treatment.Thus these are among other cases which drew me to wanting to be a lab technician running tests and trying to find cure to various infection and as for me I believe it works hand in hand with being a pharmacist.  When I think of me as a pharmacist I see myself opening many medicine and medical aid outlets across the globe with everyone being able to get treatment and assistance at the lowest cost .it's just my desire to provide medical assistance and treatment to all
