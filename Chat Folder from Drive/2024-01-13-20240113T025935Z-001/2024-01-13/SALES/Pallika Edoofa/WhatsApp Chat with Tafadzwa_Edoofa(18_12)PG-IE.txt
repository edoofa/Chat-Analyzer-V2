20/12/23, 9:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tafadzwa, Commencing the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Kelvin ?*
20/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 195 0427: 1)Well what motivated me to apply for the schoolarship program firstly was the Edoofa schoolarship program covering 50-80% of all expenses for my stay and learning in Indian and secondly quality education that statistics has shown is very high in India with a lot of diverse opportunities for success and lastly am a huge fan of the Indian culture and traditions so this came as an opportunity for me to learn more about the nation 

2)*The Edoofa Scholarship Program* 

▫️The Edoofa Scholarship Program is a transformative initiative aimed at providing *Quality International Tertiary* Education to deserving students, particularly from Africa. 
▫️Managed by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions* Pvt. Ltd. founded by *Mr.Angad and Mr.Avreen Singh* , the program addresses the challenges of both *affordability* and *employability* that many students face in pursuing tertiary education.
•Key Features of the Edoofa Scholarship Program

•Imagine having the opportunity to pursue your dream education without the burden of very high tuition fees. 
•Edoofa provides scholarships covering 50-80% of tuition costs, ensuring that financial constraints don't stand between you and a Quality International Education.
Studying in India without the scholarship granted by Edoofa is way too expensive and may cost around $7000-$8000 per year
But once I saw that with the Edoofa schoolarship program I would need a range of *$2000-$3000* per year including all academic and living expenses.
•Through the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa gives you the opportunity to alleviate the financial burden even more, by participating in online projects and earning scholarship credits <This message was edited>

03/01/24, 9:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
03/01/24, 9:17 am - +263 78 195 0427: Yes
03/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well today.
03/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
03/01/24, 9:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
03/01/24, 9:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
03/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 78 195 0427: I have had troubles with keeping up in my other subjects as my main focus was pure mathematics but I am working harder to make sure I get full points in my coming end of term school examinations and the final ZIMSEC exams
03/01/24, 11:02 am - +263 78 195 0427: I have not applied to any Universities and my knowledge on overboard education is there but limited
03/01/24, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!

*Education is a Key to Success*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
04/01/24, 9:35 am - +263 78 195 0427: Yes we may
04/01/24, 9:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
04/01/24, 9:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through this document
04/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 195 0427: Am doing well and how about you
04/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 195 0427: Yes I have
04/01/24, 1:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay as I was having my lunch.
04/01/24, 1:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Proceeding further, I would like to know that if you were interested in Medical Field, why haven't you opted for Biology?
04/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 195 0427: Well I realised medicine requires full points and if I am unable to get those full points the other fields that I will have to choose from will limit me in terms of a good job. So I choose Physics because with full points I will be able to do medicine without A level biology, and if am unable to get full points with Physics I will still be able to have a good degree maybe in Chemical physics or engineering <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 2:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
04/01/24, 2:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Biology, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
*B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology*

*Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*

*BTech in Biomedical Engineering*

*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*

Would you like me to explain any of these programs for you?
