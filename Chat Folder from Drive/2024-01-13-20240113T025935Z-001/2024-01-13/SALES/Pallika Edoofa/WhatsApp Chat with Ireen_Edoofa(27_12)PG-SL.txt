29/12/23, 12:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now, we accept up to 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35, this would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program



The minimum requirement was higher pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered but I always encourage my students to target maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and performing well in MSCE!
29/12/23, 12:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

04/01/24, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
04/01/24, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 8:32 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: No sir
04/01/24, 8:46 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: I'm not familiar
05/01/24, 9:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
05/01/24, 2:54 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: Sorry lwent to attend funeral ceremony and was very busy with church activities that l could not manage be online
05/01/24, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, I understand!
05/01/24, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope everything is fine!
05/01/24, 3:09 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: Exactly Lord is good
05/01/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, kindly address this.
05/01/24, 3:11 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: Alright l'm not familiar? Shade more light
05/01/24, 3:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/01/24, 3:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 3:22 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: Thank you very for highlighting me. On the affordability of fees lcan say it's affordable only when given time to source funds and not only just saying we want fees now but telling the students or parents to say fees will be needed on asuch day
05/01/24, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
05/01/24, 3:27 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: I don't know how it is done. But the ldear of providing some piece works to students is very important and can ensure that no student is left behind because he/she is failing to pay fees
05/01/24, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/01/24, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/01/24, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
05/01/24, 3:33 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: Yes lthink lwill benefit
05/01/24, 3:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 3:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
05/01/24, 3:45 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: Thank very for elaborating much on aEWYL program
05/01/24, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are welcome!
05/01/24, 3:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
05/01/24, 3:57 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: All the 4 are good sir from my point of view

08/01/24, 3:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the reason for the delay, Ireen?
08/01/24, 3:44 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: Sorry it network
08/01/24, 3:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
08/01/24, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
08/01/24, 3:48 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: My family was very happy when ltold them about studying in India. And l'm sure if given a chance to study there in India they will be very happy
08/01/24, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ireen, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
08/01/24, 3:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
08/01/24, 3:53 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: No sir you can elaborate
08/01/24, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Please note that  When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

09/01/24, 9:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
How are you doing today?
09/01/24, 9:46 am - +265 882 79 38 16: I am fine what about you?
09/01/24, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well.
09/01/24, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ireen, I would like you to be active for hardly 10-15 minutes so, that we can proceed to stage 2
09/01/24, 9:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are clear upto this.
09/01/24, 9:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their MSCE result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final MSCE results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.


The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
09/01/24, 10:30 am - +265 882 79 38 16: Yes it's clear but as lsaid previously lwill write my MSCE this year in July,so lam given a chance the place will have to be hold and will join the 2024-2025 academic year
09/01/24, 10:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greay!
09/01/24, 10:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ireen, As per the limited, number of seats we are enrolling students for the 2025-26 intake too.
09/01/24, 10:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 10:46 am - +265 882 79 38 16: Okay fine its better
09/01/24, 10:47 am - +265 882 79 38 16: I hope we have discussed all the stages
09/01/24, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Ireen,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
09/01/24, 3:13 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: You are welcome sir explain them
09/01/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
09/01/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
09/01/24, 4:15 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: Yes sir
09/01/24, 4:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ireen, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
09/01/24, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

09/01/24, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me connect you to Mrs Dancila, a retired Educationist from Malawi with an experience of over 30 years in the Education Sector. Her son, Gervais Bizumuremyi, a proud Edoofian arrived in India on the 17th of August 2023 and was received at the airport by Mr Abhinav Gupta, Program Director at Edoofa. Gervais was also a part of the Education Summit hosted by our founders at Lilongwe in May this year. Feel free to connect with them and learn about their experiences through the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I am also attaching pictures of his arrival.

10/01/24, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ireen, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
12/01/24, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Ireen,
How are you doing?
12/01/24, 12:20 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: Sorry lreen is back to school and the institution does not allow students to carry phones. She will come back home in April if the school will not keep them during the holiday for final touches as they are close to write MSCE examination
12/01/24, 12:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier thanMalawians, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for the students students. At the same time, the day scholars in Malawi are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students, specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Ireen?*
12/01/24, 12:34 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: No problem but lam always busy with office work which can make me to be on and offline for other businesses and the area l'm has got network problem.
12/01/24, 9:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that,

But please note that it will be only a 10-15 minutes short videos call.
12/01/24, 9:23 pm - +265 882 79 38 16: Alright no problem better network should not disrupt
