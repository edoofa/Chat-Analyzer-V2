09/01/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 274 3326: For educational aqualification she has currently wrote and passed the Zimbabwean Zimsec Grade 7 and Cambridge O' level Examinations. She is currently waiting for her Cambridge  AS Examinations Results. Currently she is in year final of high School where she is studying  Economics, Business Studies and Geography.  In terms of school ability Nicole is an above average student, who when given the correct Environment she excels. I found her to be committed and focused to her work. 2. She aspires to study Aviation Management so programs like a BSC in Airline and Airport Management and programs of a similar Nature are her desires of study.  Her Motivation is that she sees this as a challenging career whereby very few women have ventured into it and she wants to partake in changing that scenario. She is also member of the Flight Wing and Aviation Club, this has exposed her and built her interest towards the field of Aviation. Also the fact that Africa is lagging behind when it comes to Aviations Systems and Products means there is great opportunity to uplift Africa in this this regard. 3. Her hobbies are baking and playing sports like Swimming, Rugby and Dancing. HER interests are in assisting the less Privilege like in our Area we have a HOME that looks after ophaned and disadvantagee Children. She sometimes finds time to be with the kids. She also sometimes saves her pocket money to buy small goodies like sweets and fruits for the kids. She also has interests in Aviation aeroplanes probably more so because our house is close to the airport  she also likes taking care of pets like dogs. 4. We are a family of 6, children we have 2 girls and 2 boys (the other boy is a Cousin brother and we are currently staying with him) the boys are doing grade 6 and 7. Nicole is the first born she will be turning 18 on 26 January 2024 and she also has a sister Raphaela who is doing form 4 at the same shool with Nicole. 5. Nicole did her O'level at St John's High School and she is currently doing her A' level at Dominican Convent High School in Harare 6. Currently the termly schools is 2600.00USD and it has been paid by us her parents about 40% of this amount is coming from our work place.

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?

10/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well by God's grace
10/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these.
10/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
10/01/24, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

It's essential to recognize that aspiring to become a pilot usually involves enrolling in an aviation school equipped with the required infrastructure.
