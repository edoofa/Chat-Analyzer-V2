Please mark the time to ensure you're available for this important counseling session as your active participation is an important parameter for evaluation.

12/01/24, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings to you all,
As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
12/01/24, 10:11 am - +27 84 536 3657: Yes
12/01/24, 10:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Ms. Grace,
How are you doing today?
12/01/24, 10:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of students/parents or whoever is supporting the child’s education in the group. This ensures that you follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions that arise. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin. Please add Priority and her father to the group. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
12/01/24, 10:36 am - +27 84 536 3657: I'm  good thanks  and yourself

12/01/24, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Grace, I will be guiding you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program. However, just before we delve into that, I would like to get to know you better as a parent.


Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
