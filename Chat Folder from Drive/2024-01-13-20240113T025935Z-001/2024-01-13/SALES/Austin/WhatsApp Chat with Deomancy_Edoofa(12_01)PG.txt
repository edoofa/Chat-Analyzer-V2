*I am Mr Austin, Career Counselor at Edoofa and with us, we have Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions and Ms Pallika Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program.

Due to the overwhelming response from applicants, we wanted to ensure you receive personalized attention. Therefore, we've scheduled a dedicated time slot just for you:

📅 *Date: 12th January 2024*
🕤 *Time: 10:00 AM CAT*

Please mark the time to ensure you're available for this important counseling session as your active participation is an important parameter for evaluation. To prepare for our session, we encourage you to explore our website at [www.edoofa.com], the video and document shared along. This will provide you with valuable insights into our programs and opportunities. In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
12/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 71 570 9017: Yes I'm ready
12/01/24, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session,
How are you doing today? <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.


*So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
