I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
03/01/24, 5:08 pm - +263 78 322 2565: Noted with thanks . I am very much confident that I am going to work hard to aim and archieve a  maximum number of points
03/01/24, 5:12 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion towards law, you are eligible to pursue

04/01/24, 3:46 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
04/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 322 2565: Yes ,  without scholarship an international student pay $7000-$8000
04/01/24, 3:48 pm - Kunal: You are right
Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/01/24, 3:48 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 3:48 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
04/01/24, 3:51 pm - +263 78 322 2565: Yes , my family can afford the reduced cost of education
04/01/24, 3:53 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/01/24, 3:53 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
04/01/24, 3:53 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
04/01/24, 3:53 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
04/01/24, 3:53 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 3:53 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
04/01/24, 3:53 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
04/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 322 2565: The earn while you learn programme benefit me alo as it can help to  offset the costs of ones education, as he or she be bringing in an income while studying. Also it can help you to gain valuable work experience and develop skills that will be useful in your career as one will be practsing his or her carrier part time. Also it can help one to build a professional network and make connections that could be useful in the future it can be an attachment in other words. And lastly it can help one to balance your academic and professional commitments as one will be working under pressure which can be a challenge for many students.
04/01/24, 4:07 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 4:07 pm - Kunal: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
04/01/24, 4:16 pm - +263 78 322 2565: Thats great! 
 I have realised the power of this program
04/01/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
04/01/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
04/01/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
04/01/24, 4:16 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
04/01/24, 4:21 pm - +263 78 322 2565: point one
04/01/24, 4:22 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.

04/01/24, 4:22 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
04/01/24, 4:24 pm - +263 78 322 2565: both my parents will assist me with the remaining fee after Edoofa and the Earn while you learn program
04/01/24, 4:24 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
04/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 78 322 2565: On my own point of view I feel like both my Parents are excited and proud that their child is taking this next step in her  education.
04/01/24, 4:32 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
04/01/24, 4:32 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
04/01/24, 4:40 pm - +263 78 322 2565: This message was deleted
04/01/24, 4:40 pm - +263 78 322 2565: Additionally I think that should have 


1:certificates for instance birth certificate , identity card ; passport and so on are required

2: Good Results are also required

3: Also the application fee
04/01/24, 4:41 pm - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*
04/01/24, 4:41 pm - Kunal: *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
04/01/24, 4:41 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 4:43 pm - +263 78 322 2565: Okay sir thank you
04/01/24, 4:44 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
04/01/24, 4:44 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
04/01/24, 4:44 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.* <This message was edited>
04/01/24, 4:49 pm - +263 78 322 2565: Noted with thanks
04/01/24, 4:49 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 4:51 pm - +263 78 322 2565: stage three
04/01/24, 4:51 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
04/01/24, 4:54 pm - +263 78 322 2565: Yes sir
04/01/24, 4:54 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
04/01/24, 4:54 pm - Kunal: *Step 6 :* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
04/01/24, 4:58 pm - +263 78 322 2565: Crystal Clear Sir
04/01/24, 5:00 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
04/01/24, 5:00 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*
04/01/24, 5:00 pm - Kunal: *Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

05/01/24, 2:04 pm - Kunal: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
05/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 322 2565: yes , but my father is not around .

I discussed a few things with my mother
05/01/24, 2:07 pm - Kunal: That is fine,can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
05/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 322 2565: and he is not reachable at the moment buh my mother is online
05/01/24, 2:13 pm - Kunal: Alright Patricia
05/01/24, 2:13 pm - Kunal: You can address this
05/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 78 322 2565: In summary, during our family discussions about Edoofa scholarship programs we  revolved around the benefits and challenges of studying abroad. We  as a family  discussed the opportunities that come with studying in a new country, including new friends, experiences, and career prospects and also aduapting new culture .We also talked about the challenges of being away from home, like missing family and friends, cultural differences, and adapting to a new environment. Ultimately, my family wants whats best for their child, and they want to believe  that the scholarship program is the right fit for them. We also learnt that its a big decision that can be exciting and rewarding.
05/01/24, 2:20 pm - Kunal: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
05/01/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 116 6703: Well I wanted to ask that when you say Earn While You Learn you mean that the students will be offered a part-time job right
05/01/24, 2:24 pm - +263 77 116 6703: Can I have  examples of the jobs that they will be working
05/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 116 6703: First, I want to ask about the safety and security of the program and the host country.  Also I want to ask about the support system that will be in place for the child, including access to medical care, mental health support, and emergency contacts.
05/01/24, 2:36 pm - Kunal: Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

05/01/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 116 6703: Seems organized
05/01/24, 2:40 pm - Kunal: Students are given real-time live online projects based on digital marketing, organization management to develop soft skills like communication skills, leadership, presentation skills, teamwork, etc.during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student's performance) which wouldn't be physical cash but they can contribute to a part of their higher education fees and make their university education even more affordable.
The working hours would be flexible and they would be able to make the free time productive.
05/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 116 6703: Ok noted with thanks
05/01/24, 2:48 pm - Kunal: This is well noted,
