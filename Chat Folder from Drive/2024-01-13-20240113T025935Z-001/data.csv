I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special ‚Äì our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called *SLICE CON' 24* for our Indian Edoofians! üöÄ  During this event, *we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands* who will be present and sharing their invaluable *experiences in one-on-one sessions.* Yes, you read that right ‚Äì they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. ü§ù

I want to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that took place over the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! It was so happening, and I am delighted to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.  Not only that, but we also hosted various industrial leaders, and it went exceptionally well; our students managed to give a presentation in front of them, and they really liked it. Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech Made Easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

31 - 12 Jan 2024 04:39PM - Ananya Edoofa: I wanted to share a few glimpses of the industrial visit, SLICE CON 24, that was going on for the last three days, especially for our Indian Edoofinas! You know, it was so happening, and I am happy to share that we also welcomed Mr. Peter Hobwani, Deputy Head of Mission and Head of Chancery, Embassy of the Republic of Zimbabwe to India.  Not only this, but during this event, we were fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who presented and shared their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right ‚Äì they were there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students presented directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products.  Our students also enjoyed the 'Tech made easy' sessions, where we taught them to use new-age technological tools, including Artificial Intelligence. The sweetest part was that a few of our students even prepared a surprise performance for us as well. It was indeed an amazing experience. When you are here in India, we will also connect at such events.

60 - 12 Jan 2024 02:06PM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
61 - 12 Jan 2024 02:06PM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

106 - 12 Jan 2024 01:59PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*  *STEP 1*: You‚Äôre supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them- *STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
107 - 12 Jan 2024 01:59PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.  The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
108 - 12 Jan 2024 02:00PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination). Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6. Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
109 - 12 Jan 2024 02:00PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.",No,Yes

A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.",No,No

96 - 12 Jan 2024 01:27PM - Dev Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Amanda!  With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'  The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
97 - 12 Jan 2024 01:27PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
98 - 12 Jan 2024 01:27PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

I hope you all are doing great.With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'  The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
353 - 12 Jan 2024 02:55PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
354 - 12 Jan 2024 02:55PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.

Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

52 - 12 Jan 2024 02:34PM - Dev Edoofa: Till then with great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'  The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
53 - 12 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
54 - 12 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

With great excitement and pride, I want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'  The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
106 - 12 Jan 2024 12:51PM - Dev Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experience. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
107 - 12 Jan 2024 12:51PM - Dev Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we start our session today, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

On-Campus Accommodation*  The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.  So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27 - 11 Jan 2024 09:33PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*  As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable.  - You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.  - If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.

Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.  I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?

As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
2 - 12 Jan 2024 05:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
3 - 12 Jan 2024 05:40PM - Kirti Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'  The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
7 - 12 Jan 2024 07:06PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
8 - 12 Jan 2024 07:06PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

182 - 12 Jan 2024 12:08PM - +263 77 441 5087: 4.Several compelling factors have pushed me as an individual to want to study criminal law.Firstly l have a strong desire to seek justice and ensure that the rights of individuals are protected and that serves as a significant motivating factor. The opportunity to advocate for victims of crime and work towards holding perpetrators accountable is also a powerful driving force for my interest in criminal law.I have the desire to make a tangible impact on society by addressing issues such as wrongful convictions, systematic injustice moreso I would like to have an opportunity to work closely with law enforcement agencies, forensic experts,and other legal professionals   last but not least the desire to contribute to a safer and more jst society, coupled with the intellectual and practical challenges presented made me choose criminal law lastly the complexity of criminal cases,the need for thorough investigation and the opportunity to engage in courtroom litigation is intellectual why I chose criminal law
183 - 12 Jan 2024 12:24PM - +263 77 441 5087: 5.Growing up, I have always been passionate about becoming a lawyer, and I was convinced that I can make it in this field. My goal has remained steadfast, and it has been the driving force behind achieving my lifelong dream of being a lawyer. To be a highly successful lawyer, several key skills are essential. Firstly, I believe I possess exceptional communication skills. Additionally, I have strong analytical and critical thinking skills, as well as problem-solving abilities.  Furthermore, I am confident in my excellent research skills. Moreover, the ability to negotiate skillfully, mediate disputes, and advocate on behalf of people requires strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence, which I believe I possess.  Additionally, I am adept at managing high-pressure situations effectively.  Finally, effective time management, organization, and the ability to work collaboratively in a team. I have served as a prefect at school, representing other students and advocating for them when they were mistreated by others or by teachers. I believe these qualities will contribute to my success as a lawyer.

213 - 12 Jan 2024 02:06PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772944709 miscellaneous fees are basically sports fees, uniform fees, etc.
214 - 12 Jan 2024 02:06PM - Kirti Edoofa: Registration fee is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.  I hope we are clear here?
215 - 12 Jan 2024 02:15PM - +263 77 294 4709: Is there any other extra costs in a period of one year that is not the $1200-$1800 fees and the 350 registration fees.
216 - 12 Jan 2024 02:21PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand better. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year‚Äôs fee, which is $1350 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be within the first three days of your arrival in India.
217 - 12 Jan 2024 02:55PM - +263 77 294 4709: For avoidace of doubt are you saying the full payment will be $1350 per year. If there are any other cost after $1350 can l know then now so tht l do not get confused
218 - 12 Jan 2024 03:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
219 - 12 Jan 2024 03:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
220 - 12 Jan 2024 03:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
221 - 12 Jan 2024 03:27PM - +263 77 294 4709: Im sorry this was not answered clearly, l need to understand the totol payment that lm expected to pay in one year. The overal total in one year. I request that this be made clear so tht we get prepared
222 - 12 Jan 2024 03:31PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772944709 let me help you understand along with this amount, you will be required to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. The average flight expenses from Zimbabwe to India will be $400-$500 and visa fee will be $83.
227 - 12 Jan 2024 03:48PM - +263 77 294 4709: Is there any remaining annual fees after paying between $1200-$1800  Are we paying the university seperately or the $1200-$1800 is the university fees
228 - 12 Jan 2024 03:54PM - +263 77 441 5087: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is __Ms Ananya_______ and he/she has scheduled my session for ___1:30-2:30pm_____"" <This message was edited>

231 - 12 Jan 2024 06:46PM - +263 77 294 4709: Are u saying there are no two sets of fees one for Edoofa and one for the university ?. Im continously asking these questions so tht this is very clear for us a family. This msge brought confusion to us because l see there is miscellaneous $1000 there is registration $1000 and there is $350 tition fees bringing us to a total of $2350

201 - 12 Jan 2024 01:47PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
202 - 12 Jan 2024 01:47PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
222 - 12 Jan 2024 02:37PM - +260 763785676: It does.
223 - 12 Jan 2024 02:38PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*  I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
224 - 12 Jan 2024 02:38PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
225 - 12 Jan 2024 02:38PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
226 - 12 Jan 2024 02:40PM - +260 763785676: I have followed the details.
227 - 12 Jan 2024 03:26PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level / garde 12 results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
228 - 12 Jan 2024 03:27PM - +260 763785676: I'm aware.
229 - 12 Jan 2024 03:28PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level/ grade 12 results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
230 - 12 Jan 2024 03:28PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
231 - 12 Jan 2024 03:28PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.",No,Yes

With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'  The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
6 - 12 Jan 2024 06:56PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
7 - 12 Jan 2024 06:56PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
2 - 12 Jan 2024 06:05PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life.

On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
4 - 12 Jan 2024 06:38PM - +260 97 7822958: Greetings. We are very excited to hear about your accomplishments as a country. Indeed, it is a motivation to all especially emerging and less developed countries. We grateful to the Almighty God for reaching us into the new year and are happy to receive best wishes from you. We also wish you the best in this year. Regards.

With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'  The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
6 - 12 Jan 2024 06:55PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
7 - 12 Jan 2024 06:55PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

As we step into the second week of January, I wanted to reach out and share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 - the successful India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.
2 - 12 Jan 2024 05:53PM - Kirti Edoofa: This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.

With great excitement and pride, I also want to share that over the past few days, the Edoofa team has been immersed in an exciting event we had in store for our students. Edoofa hosted a conference - the Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'  The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
7 - 12 Jan 2024 07:09PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
8 - 12 Jan 2024 07:09PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

5 - 12 Jan 2024 02:59PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanastwa,  I hope this message finds you well. It has been a while since we last connected, and I understand that you must be concerned before we move forward with our discussion. I wanted to take this opportunity to share some exciting news with you. Recently, Edoofa hosted a conference called the *Symposium of Leaders, Innovators, and Creators at Edoofa, also known as 'SLICE-CON.'*  The conference was attended by all the Edoofians of 2023 and a few senior Edoofians from previous batches. It focused on the art of creation, innovation, and, most importantly, the mindset required to make an impact in one's career.
6 - 12 Jan 2024 02:59PM - Kirti Edoofa: During this Industrial Visit and the conference - SLICE CON, Corporate leaders, such as the CEOs and Co-founders from renowned companies like Rage Coffee, Sirona Hygiene, Jolin New York, and more, shared their insights and experiences. These individuals are at the helm of multi-millionaire brands, leading large marketing teams. Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.
7 - 12 Jan 2024 02:59PM - Kirti Edoofa: We believe that interactions with such industry leaders can bring significant transformations to students' lives, enhancing their business acumen. Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams.

232 - 12 Jan 2024 02:29PM - Kirti Edoofa: This registration fee of $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve Tapuwanashe's scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.  I hope we are clear here?
233 - 12 Jan 2024 02:30PM - Kirti Edoofa: The visa processing fee is not needed right now we will guide you through those steps as well 2 months prior to Tapuwanashe's arrival for now you focus needs to be on reserving Tapuwanashe's seat with the university.

Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*  On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
239 - 12 Jan 2024 03:38PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.  This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins.

Their presence added immense value, providing students with the opportunity to engage in transformative conversations.

Our Edoofians maximized this opportunity, having life-changing conversations with these influential figures. The main objective of the event was to emphasize the importance of thinking outside the box, and encouraging students to believe in themselves and their dreams. Before we discuss your admission journey further, I wanted to share a glimpse of the event, and I hope you are excited to attend similar events when you come to India.

Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35. This would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program. The minimum requirement was higher before the pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!  I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and performing well in MSCE.

In which country will they be studying through the Edoofa program?  3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship for a child?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if a child is found eligible for the program?  5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child‚Äôs university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
270 - 12 Jan 2024 11:51AM - Arshita: Can you please answer these points?
271 - 12 Jan 2024 12:23PM - +265 991 74 37 28: Prince M'balaki will be studying Bachelor of computer application,  Kettie will be studying Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology.  They be studying in India  The average cost of studies in India without a scholarship for a child is $3000.  The annual fee if a child is found eligible for the program is $1200,this does not mean there is any limit up to which students can earn,as much as student is is willing to work hard to sponsor her or his higher education,can earn accordingly.  As a parent am very clear on edoofa scholarship and it's a wish come true because these are the most affordable rates of scholarship I as a parent I will benefit with my kids and I believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their carrier as they know it's value.

281 - 12 Jan 2024 01:30PM - Arshita: As you know, students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier thanMalawians, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for the students students. At the same time, the day scholars in Malawi are still applying and clearing the tests.  All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students, specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out.  *So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Kattie and Prince?*

36 - 12 Jan 2024 02:49PM - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about her achieving it.

229 - 12 Jan 2024 12:28PM - Arshita: As you know, A-level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests.  All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out.  *So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Runesu?*

231 - 12 Jan 2024 02:17PM - Arshita: I appreciate your willingness to participate in your child‚Äôs career! Can you tell me  1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?  2. In which country will he/she be studying through the Edoofa program?  3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?  5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child‚Äôs university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?

148 - 12 Jan 2024 12:26PM - Garima Edoofa: @263772609055as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

136 - 12 Jan 2024 10:29AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
137 - 12 Jan 2024 10:29AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
138 - 12 Jan 2024 10:29AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
139 - 12 Jan 2024 10:29AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
140 - 12 Jan 2024 10:29AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

146 - 12 Jan 2024 11:42AM - Gurvinder: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional.

In particular, the genocide had a disproportionate impact on women, who suffered widespread sexual violence and were left to rebuild their lives and communities without the support of many male family members. The trauma of the genocide also led to an increase in gender-based violence and a decrease in female political participation. Another major social issue that has been affected by the genocide is the issue of orphans and child-headed households. During the genocide, an estimated 250,000 children were orphaned, and many of these children were forced to become heads of households, taking on adult responsibilities at a young age. The government has implemented a number of programs to support these children, including foster care programs, educational assistance, and economic support. Another important issue to consider is the impact of the genocide on mental health. The trauma of the genocide has had a lasting impact on the mental health of many Rwandans, with high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. The government has worked to address these issues through a variety of mental health programs, including trauma counseling, community-based interventions, and the establishment of a national mental health policy. Another major issue that has been impacted by the genocide is the issue of land rights and property disputes. During the genocide, many people were forcibly removed from their land or had their property confiscated. In the aftermath of the genocide, these issues have been a source of conflict and instability, as people have struggled to regain their land and homes. The government has implemented a number of policies to address these issues, including a land reform program and a national commission to resolve property disputes.The genocide had a devastating impact on Rwanda, leading to long-term challenges in a number of areas, including gender inequality, child-headed households, mental health, and land rights. The government has made significant efforts to address these issues, through policies and programs aimed at improving the lives of Rwandans. Although progress has been made, there is still much work to be done to heal the wounds of the genocide and to ensure a more peaceful and prosperous future for the country.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1.

In particular, the genocide had a disproportionate impact on women, who suffered widespread sexual violence and were left to rebuild their lives and communities without the support of many male family members. The trauma of the genocide also led to an increase in gender-based violence and a decrease in female political participation. Another major social issue that has been affected by the genocide is the issue of orphans and child-headed households. During the genocide, an estimated 250,000 children were orphaned, and many of these children were forced to become heads of households, taking on adult responsibilities at a young age. The government has implemented a number of programs to support these children, including foster care programs, educational assistance, and economic support. Another important issue to consider is the impact of the genocide on mental health. The trauma of the genocide has had a lasting impact on the mental health of many Rwandans, with high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. The government has worked to address these issues through a variety of mental health programs, including trauma counseling, community-based interventions, and the establishment of a national mental health policy. Another major issue that has been impacted by the genocide is the issue of land rights and property disputes. During the genocide, many people were forcibly removed from their land or had their property confiscated. In the aftermath of the genocide, these issues have been a source of conflict and instability, as people have struggled to regain their land and homes. The government has implemented a number of policies to address these issues, including a land reform program and a national commission to resolve property disputes.The genocide had a devastating impact on Rwanda, leading to long-term challenges in a number of areas, including gender inequality, child-headed households, mental health, and land rights. The government has made significant efforts to address these issues, through policies and programs aimed at improving the lives of Rwandans. Although progress has been made, there is still much work to be done to heal the wounds of the genocide and to ensure a more peaceful and prosperous future for the country.

27 - 12 Jan 2024 11:56AM - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Kelvin who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
28 - 12 Jan 2024 11:59AM - +263 77 529 2616: Yes, he did. The Quantum of the scholarship I was informed of was 50% - 80%
29 - 12 Jan 2024 12:29PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Charmaine, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.    In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*  You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.

Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course  First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.  Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.  Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:  *Production Engineering* *Industrial Engineering* *Manufacturing Engineering* *Automobile Engineering* *Artificial Intelligence*  The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.  *Mechanics*  Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine  *Mechatronics and Robotics*  Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.  Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).  Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.  *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*  Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.  Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.  *Design and drafting*  Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.  Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.  Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Jeston had the opportunity to study in India at subsidized tuition fees and benefited from the high technology of Indian education system unlike our situation in Zimbabwe Also Jeston will be offered more opportunities to secure a job or further his studies Its quite an uplifting and life changing  journey

14 - 11 Jan 2024 09:40PM - +263 77 283 9309: Noted, thank you !!
15 - 12 Jan 2024 09:07AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!  *‚ÄúEducation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.‚Äù*  Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
16 - 12 Jan 2024 09:51AM - +263 77 386 1078: We will be there! I'm looking forward to an elegant event.
17 - 12 Jan 2024 10:31AM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
18 - 12 Jan 2024 10:31AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19 - 12 Jan 2024 10:31AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20 - 12 Jan 2024 10:31AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
21 - 12 Jan 2024 10:31AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

25 - 12 Jan 2024 12:09PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Chiponda, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
26 - 12 Jan 2024 12:28PM - +263 77 386 1078: Definitely !
27 - 12 Jan 2024 12:39PM - +263 77 283 9309: Oh yeah we are willing and able !!

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
8 - 12 Jan 2024 10:02AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
9 - 12 Jan 2024 10:02AM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
10 - 12 Jan 2024 10:02AM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.",No,No

Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

75 - 12 Jan 2024 10:11PM - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.  I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.  I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

67 - 12 Jan 2024 01:13PM - Gurvinder: That is really great Monde I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,  However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.  Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
68 - 12 Jan 2024 01:19PM - +260 96 8231145: Yes,yes I am.
69 - 12 Jan 2024 01:42PM - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
70 - 12 Jan 2024 02:11PM - +260 96 8231145: Because I feel there is more material and accuracy in the syllabus used in Indiana and it offers full scheme lessons. Thank you.
71 - 12 Jan 2024 02:30PM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
72 - 12 Jan 2024 02:37PM - +260 96 8231145: Firstly,by improving the learning facilities and ensuring a comfortable environment in which the learners can concentrate and gain interest. Gaining support from the government to help the learning institutions in Nursery, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary levels, to be fully hands on ,on the understanding of learners. And most importantly dealing with the health department in controlling and improving some of the many sicknesses found in our Tropical climate, so as to maintain social, physical and psychological wellbeing of every individual. Thank you.
66 - 12 Jan 2024 12:56PM - +260 96 8231145: Thank you. After I have successfully completed the course I see myself being committed and helpful and in the sector, insuring the adequate provision and understanding of Nutrition and it's importance. Directing individuals and people properly to take care of their health and eat food that will make their lives better and not bitter. I see myself empowering the people and convincing them that eating healthy is the right way. Making an opportunity for people to be fully aware of Thier nutritional needs, and supporting them not to give up. Being part of the Edoofa program will enable me to achieve my long perceived dream of studying abroad and gaining exposure, experience and knowledge which I am willing to use skilfully and share. I believe it will give me an eye opening opportunity to discover my skills and abilities and be able to utilize very well. Thank you.

Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course  First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.  Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.  Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:  *Production Engineering* *Industrial Engineering* *Manufacturing Engineering* *Automobile Engineering* *Artificial Intelligence*  The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.  *Mechanics*  Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine  *Mechatronics and Robotics*  Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.  Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).  Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.  *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*  Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.  Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.  *Design and drafting*  Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.  Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.  Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

2 - 12 Jan 2024 08:08AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Mulindi Mwaka!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
3 - 12 Jan 2024 08:23AM - +260 97 7576833: Good morning sir. My shallow understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program is that the programme is design to reduce the financial burden that less privileged but gifted individuals have. It is meant for focused people that can't afford quality university /college education. It also aim to see to it that the graduates get employment easily. This is what I know about Edoofa scholarship program.
4 - 12 Jan 2024 09:23AM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
5 - 12 Jan 2024 09:23AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
6 - 12 Jan 2024 09:23AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
7 - 12 Jan 2024 09:23AM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
8 - 12 Jan 2024 09:23AM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
11 - 12 Jan 2024 09:24AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12 - 12 Jan 2024 09:39AM - +260 97 3906423: Yes this is like reducing the burdens that is weighed on our parents and this program can help our parents in all this
13 - 12 Jan 2024 09:41AM - +260 97 3906423: And I think it will help me persue a better future for myself and it will help me be an independent student and take more responsibility towards higher education by myself
14 - 12 Jan 2024 09:45AM - +260 97 7576833: Indeed, just like Mwaka has put it, us parents are faced with numerous financial challenges especially concerning the education of our children. Considering the high standards of living coupled with the insufficient income flow, we find it difficult to support quality university for our children. It is for this reason Edoofa scholarships were established, I believe.
15 - 12 Jan 2024 09:46AM - +260 97 7576833: , *quality university *education*
16 - 12 Jan 2024 10:25AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Mwaka, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

16 - 12 Jan 2024 10:25AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Mwaka, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
3 - 12 Jan 2024 01:47PM - +260 776497959: Good Morning Sir ... I barely understand this Program .. I only know that it's a Scholarship Program .
4 - 12 Jan 2024 02:14PM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you.
5 - 12 Jan 2024 02:14PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
6 - 12 Jan 2024 02:14PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
7 - 12 Jan 2024 02:14PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
8 - 12 Jan 2024 02:14PM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.",No,Yes

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
6 - 12 Jan 2024 09:37AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
7 - 12 Jan 2024 09:37AM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
8 - 12 Jan 2024 09:37AM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
10 - 12 Jan 2024 09:38AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11 - 12 Jan 2024 09:38AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12 - 12 Jan 2024 09:44AM - +260 97 9527180: Thank you so much for the detailed information on what the program is all about. We appreciate that our daughter is one of the considered student for the program. We are so excited about it
13 - 12 Jan 2024 09:50AM - +260 96 8927757: When one is doing the work while you earn , does it distract the pupils from there studies or like may it disturb the students from there studies?  When picking people to be part of the edoofa program do results also help you secure your seat in the edoofa program ?
14 - 12 Jan 2024 09:51AM - +260 96 8927757: Thank you for the information I know have a broad understanding of the program
15 - 12 Jan 2024 10:32AM - Gurvinder: Please do not worry about that, I will explain you everything ahead in the counselling session.
16 - 12 Jan 2024 10:33AM - +260 96 8927757: Alright Thank you
17 - 12 Jan 2024 11:43AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Namooba, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18 - 12 Jan 2024 12:03PM - +260 96 8927757: Yes

34 - 12 Jan 2024 12:47PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Nomore, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

2 - 12 Jan 2024 08:10AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning PHADALESS TEMBO!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
3 - 12 Jan 2024 08:23AM - +260 96 9954688: Good morning thank you! I understand that your institution offers a higher and more safer environment for people to get to further there education and have a better variety of learning space . I also understand that this program will help build better futures that can help empower so many of us and become better people and leaders of the next generation.
4 - 12 Jan 2024 09:25AM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
5 - 12 Jan 2024 09:25AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
6 - 12 Jan 2024 09:25AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
7 - 12 Jan 2024 09:25AM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
8 - 12 Jan 2024 09:25AM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

2 - 12 Jan 2024 08:05AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Priscah Munsanje!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
3 - 12 Jan 2024 10:07AM - +260 763422390: Edoofa scholarship program is a program that helps people get sponsored in India, it's not a university it just helps people get sponsored in universities which are found in India
4 - 12 Jan 2024 11:26AM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me clearly brief you about the program.
5 - 12 Jan 2024 11:27AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
6 - 12 Jan 2024 11:27AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
7 - 12 Jan 2024 11:27AM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
8 - 12 Jan 2024 11:27AM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

11 - 12 Jan 2024 11:27AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12 - 12 Jan 2024 11:40AM - +260 763422390: Yes
13 - 12 Jan 2024 12:11PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Priscah, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
14 - 12 Jan 2024 12:21PM - +260 763422390: Yes
15 - 12 Jan 2024 12:43PM - Gurvinder: Now Priscah, I would like to know you better as a student.

May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
3 - 12 Jan 2024 09:34AM - +260 97 2734717: This message was deleted
4 - 12 Jan 2024 10:05AM - +260 97 2734717: It's an organization or associated with edoofa,an international educational company.its likely forcuses mainly on providing educational opportunities, scholarship to students, aligning with Edoofa mission of accessible and quality education
5 - 12 Jan 2024 11:25AM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
6 - 12 Jan 2024 11:25AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
7 - 12 Jan 2024 11:25AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
8 - 12 Jan 2024 11:26AM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
9 - 12 Jan 2024 11:26AM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.",No,No

74 - 12 Jan 2024 12:47PM - +260 97 2873802: With the Edoofa's Program by my side and a little bit of extra work I believe I would have a lot of ample job opportunities with the knowledge acquired, I believe I would seek employment from a top notch hospital, clinic or rehabilitation center. After five years I see my self being a real life superhero with skills help patience live longer and healthy lives as well as making close bonds with team mates and patients which I feel is a major benefit. I see myself being one of the best cardiovascular technologist being able to conduct tests on pulmonary or cardiovascular systems of patients for diagnostic purposes. Am going to aim higher and further with my studies. I see myself being able to work full time schedules in hospital working fairly during week ends and nights getting familiar to patients by engaging them in small talk and other things which is quite enjoyable

80 - 12 Jan 2024 04:42PM - +260 97 2873802: Because studying abroad gives me the opportunity to see the world from a different aspect experiencing a brand new country with incredible outlooks, customs and activities. It also gives me a chance to experience different styles of education which may not have been exposed in my own country. I also believe it can also be a way for me to understand and appreciate county's history and people, perhaps even granting me an chance to immerse myself in a new language. It would be easier for me to find employment because I would have gotten used to the unfamiliar environment by meeting new life long friends from different backgrounds

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.  I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

14 - 12 Jan 2024 09:51AM - +263 78 999 3460: Edoofa is a scholarship program that was designed specifically because of the belief thag every child should have access to quality education. Its benefits over Zimbabwean Universities are it assists or pays tuition fees for students who are in someway unable to pay tuition fees at Universities in their countries and that students can earn money ranging from 50 to 100 dollars while studying.
15 - 12 Jan 2024 09:51AM - +263 78 999 3460: No she didn't tell me about her experience
16 - 12 Jan 2024 10:33AM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
17 - 12 Jan 2024 10:33AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18 - 12 Jan 2024 10:33AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19 - 12 Jan 2024 10:33AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20 - 12 Jan 2024 10:33AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

22 - 12 Jan 2024 12:08PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Shepherd, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23 - 12 Jan 2024 10:28PM - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it‚Äôs been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

29 - 12 Jan 2024 02:27PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
30 - 12 Jan 2024 02:27PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
31 - 12 Jan 2024 02:27PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

32 - 12 Jan 2024 02:27PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

102 - 12 Jan 2024 12:31PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
103 - 12 Jan 2024 12:31PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
104 - 12 Jan 2024 12:31PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
105 - 12 Jan 2024 12:31PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
106 - 12 Jan 2024 12:31PM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

108 - 12 Jan 2024 02:25PM - Gurvinder: In simple words Mrs Mukela what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program former students of St. David's Bonda which also happens to be our associate school, they are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, she would be the right person to help you clarify how the Edoofa scholarship program has assisted her and how it was possible for her to cater towards international education for both her children at the same time. Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

272 - 12 Jan 2024 11:42AM - Gurvinder: So @263774331473, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me  1. What is the name of the course that STUDENTSNAME would be studying through the Edoofa Program?  2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?  3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?  5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?  6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.  7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
273 - 12 Jan 2024 02:18PM - +263 77 433 1473: 1. Actuarial Science 2. India 3. $6000-$8000 4. $1500-$2300 5. $350 which can be    payable in installments, $200 to be paid within 7 days then$150 to be paid within 30days.  6. From my own understanding, Earn While You Learn program is a good program whereby  a Student/Trainee is attached to a job/project to do for learning purpose at the same time doing a job earning something. This is good as it motivates the learner. It also helps parents or guardians to  reduce the school fees bills.  The program helps the Learner to get experience  for his/her program while still a Learner. Earn While You Learn program is very good for both parents, Learner and the Tutor. The Tutor/Trainer will also assess the trainee's project or job noting which area is good and which area is weak during the program. 7. Yes

It is a process whereby the weather patterns changes in way that they mislead farmers who who are season dependant as they may grow a certain crops in certain seasons.This leads to poor diet since there will not be enough balanced diet food for people to eat . Porverty is another reason that causes poor diet in Africa. People may not afford to buy food that contains a balanced diet leading them to buy junk food.  They will be having to choose quantity over quality since the junk food.will be high in quantity not quality. In other areas there is shortage of land for farming the place will be crowded with and no space for agriculture thereby people will have poor diets as they will not have a piece of land for them to supplement their diet by growing nessesary crops for food . The availability of fast foods has also resulted in people having an unbalanced diet
371 - 12 Jan 2024 06:13AM - +263 78 212 1712: People tend to rely on buying fast foods as. They are  cheap and easily available
372 - 12 Jan 2024 06:13AM - +263 78 212 1712: So busy people buy them and do not consider having a balanced diet.                    To a lesser extent Africans have poor diets not only because their farms are stagnant and inefficient but because of other reasons which include poverty, availability of fast foods, climate change and overpopulation in other areas thereby reducing the land for farming in that area.
373 - 12 Jan 2024 06:13AM - +263 78 212 1712: Section 6.                                    Life is like a wheel which turns periodically. There are tough times
374 - 12 Jan 2024 06:13AM - +263 78 212 1712: .... and good times but the main thing in life is to keep on being persistent and work towards achieving your goals. They say if life offers lemon you must make lemonade  out of it and never fear taking risks because no risk no gain and failure is the key to success. A successful person is the one who take risks and has also endured a lot of losses but even though he has pushed until he is at the top. There were 2 brothers named Peter and Paul. They were from the same womb but their worlds were different. Peter was hard working and believed that no pain no gain. Paul believed that if you never try you will never fail. One day their father gave them each $5 . He instructed them to make sure that by the time he returns they must make use of the money in such a way that it will be beneficial. Paul used the money to buy food items and clothes so that he could wear. To him he thought that that it was beneficial since food and clothing are basic human needs. Peter used all his on sweets. Paul laughed at Peter saying that he has wasted the money on some sweets like a kid . Peter kept quiet and went out with his sweets to the e shops to sell them . By the end of the day Peter had already sold all of the sweets and had a total amount of$10. When his father returned he asked his two sons to present what they had done with the money . Peter presented his $10 note and Paul presented his clothes and food items . Peter then explained to his father that he used the money as capital and sold sweets so tmhe mande a profit of another $5 note. Paul also explained to his father that he bought food and clothing items since they are basic human needs so they were important. Their father congratulated Peter saying that instead of sending the money you made it increase so he was made the new owner of the father's property. He also told Paul that since he thinks food and clothing are important he was made to stay and work for Peter so that Petere would give his brother food and clothes since they are important to him.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.

90 - 12 Jan 2024 11:47AM - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often. So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable. Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable. As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa. The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$450, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations

68 - 12 Jan 2024 01:42PM - +263 71 830 8198: Thanks the for the  clarification pertaining aerospace engineering   But l was just asking a casual question that l may have chosen aerospace engineering but what other good options can be for an engineering student
69 - 12 Jan 2024 01:48PM - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Oliver I am here to guide you in opting for the best course in your interest and I will support you throughout the counselling session so that can opt for the course and receive the maximum scholarship that best aligns with your interests and as well as that offers the best opportunities out there
70 - 12 Jan 2024 01:48PM - Keshav Edoofa: Oliver, looking at your interests and passion for aero planes and aeronautics, let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but as your counselor I would like to highlight a few parameters  This is a niche course that has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low  If you opt for this branch, your scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself. At the same time, if you opt for a degree like *Mechanical Engineering*, it can help to bridge you to Aeronautical, Aerospace, Automotive, etc at the same time helps to fulfill your interests to solve challenges, to bring innovations, and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as the mother of Engineering!
71 - 12 Jan 2024 01:54PM - +263 71 830 8198: So to start with aerospace engineering from scratch is it a good idea or
72 - 12 Jan 2024 02:10PM - Keshav Edoofa: See Oliver as your counselor i will guide you to the best course that will down the years of line will get you the maximum opportunities
73 - 12 Jan 2024 02:12PM - Keshav Edoofa: In my opinion, opting for such a niche course like Aerospace Engineering will provide you with limited opportunities ahead, and on the other hand if you opt for Mechanical Engineering then it will open a plethora of opportunities for you ahead. Even if you pursue Mechanical Engineering in your undergraduate you will be able to pursue Aerospace Engineering in your masters
74 - 12 Jan 2024 02:14PM - Keshav Edoofa: So it is best for you if opt for Mechanical Engineering and as your counselor I want you to succeed ahead with having maximum opportunities at your hand and get the maximum scholarship to pursue Mechanical Engineering under our Edoofa scholarship program
75 - 12 Jan 2024 02:16PM - Keshav Edoofa: Also shall I brief you about Btech Mechanical Engineering in detail?
76 - 12 Jan 2024 02:22PM - +263 71 830 8198: Yes
75 - 12 Jan 2024 02:16PM - Keshav Edoofa: Also shall I brief you about Btech Mechanical Engineering in detail?

77 - 12 Jan 2024 02:23PM - Keshav Edoofa: Before that Oliver did you comprehend what I told you? Also Kindly give me your views now regarding the same
78 - 12 Jan 2024 02:25PM - +263 71 830 8198: Yea but as a matter of l was opting for these 3 1 Aeronautical engineering 2 petroleum engineering 3. Engineering
79 - 12 Jan 2024 02:27PM - +263 71 830 8198: I heard you but l was considering if l can get a counselling pertaining those 3
80 - 12 Jan 2024 03:01PM - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon Oliver! I was busy in a meeting with the Acaedmic Board Of Edoofa Let us kindly resume your session for today
81 - 12 Jan 2024 03:01PM - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are available right now
82 - 12 Jan 2024 03:04PM - Keshav Edoofa: Regarding your 3rd point Oliver, Engineering in general is a very vast domain that contains more than 50 specializations. It is not at all advisable that I explain every branch of engineering to you as you will get further confused and clueless regarding the course to pursue
83 - 12 Jan 2024 03:11PM - Keshav Edoofa: Regarding Petroleum Engineering Oliver, see field of petroleum engineering is a very niche branch of engineering and a highly specialized field. The scope of petroleum engineering is gradually declining over the years and continues to be so. Petroleum engineering jobs and opportunities are very limited and to only specific countries in the Middle East now and it keeps on decreasing with time.  Therefore Oliver it is not very advisable to pursue petroleum engineering in such a scenario
84 - 12 Jan 2024 03:15PM - Keshav Edoofa: As you told me about your interests and aspirations regarding Aerospace engineering I truly understand it Oliver but you must know Aerospace Engineering is a sub-domain of Mechanical Engineering.  All the job opportunities that exist for aerospace engineering apply to mechanical engineering as well but certainly not vice-versa, thus it is advised to a student to pursue mechanical engineering and if they truly discover their interest in aerospace engineering they always have the scope to pursue aerospace engineering in their masters!",No,Yes

Your response is crucial, as it represents your support for this unique opportunity, which will provide your child with affordable, quality higher education and valuable employability skills.  Please keep in mind that many other families and deserving candidates are awaiting counselling and evaluation sessions, and we need to allocate slots for them. *To ensure the process proceeds smoothly, we kindly request your feedback by today (12/01/2024) otherwise, the application will be put on hold which can lead to losing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.* If you have any challenges, do not hesitate to share, you can feel free to open up and I will be guiding you further.

238 - 12 Jan 2024 08:31AM - +265 999 36 24 22: Iam fine ,  how are you. I have gone through the letter from the Academic Head and have well understood the content. May suggest we put this process on hold until Dan‚Äôs Exams this coming June. At time, we as family, will be comfortable to make informed decisions/commitments other than now.
239 - 12 Jan 2024 09:49AM - Kunal: I understand, Mr Moses As you know, students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Malawians, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for the Central African students. At the same time, the day scholars are still applying and clearing the tests.  All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out.
240 - 12 Jan 2024 09:50AM - Kunal: *So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Dan?*

174 - 12 Jan 2024 02:57PM - Kunal: Well, We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.  Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
175 - 12 Jan 2024 03:35PM - +263 71 676 7555: Yes
176 - 12 Jan 2024 03:38PM - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
177 - 12 Jan 2024 03:38PM - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.
178 - 12 Jan 2024 03:39PM - +263 71 676 7555: Yes thank you
179 - 12 Jan 2024 08:49PM - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-  *About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.* *Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.* *The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
180 - 12 Jan 2024 08:49PM - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,  *Edoofa‚Äôs Website- www.edoofa.com* *Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*  *Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.  Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

According to my understanding the enrollment fee is 350 and is paid in 7 days but it can also be paid in two phases thus the first $200 in 7 days and the remaining in 30 days also the annual fee is $2000_$3000 but if a student excell well in eveluation then the average fee is $1500_$2300.The Earn While You Learn programme is all about partaking a project as well as earning money that you can use for paying semester fees.You will be learning and gaining experience and at the same time earning your own money which helps reduce the financial pressure to parents.In other words,as much as you will be willing to sponsor your own education ,you will also earn accordingly

127 - 12 Jan 2024 08:24AM - Kunal: Let me guide you ahead
128 - 12 Jan 2024 08:24AM - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child‚Äôs eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

130 - 12 Jan 2024 08:31AM - +27 67 740 7312: Yes please
131 - 12 Jan 2024 08:48AM - Kunal: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn‚Äôt meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.  The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year‚Äôs annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
132 - 12 Jan 2024 08:48AM - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes,  *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *Earn While You Learn Program and training* *University sessions and selection* *A guaranteed scholarship seat* *Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
133 - 12 Jan 2024 08:48AM - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*

What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?  5.

260 - 12 Jan 2024 12:24PM - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier thanMalawians, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for the students students. At the same time, the day scholars in Malawi are still applying and clearing the tests.  All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students, specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out.  *So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Ireen?*

177 - 12 Jan 2024 10:12AM - +263 71 427 4635: Thank you
178 - 12 Jan 2024 10:13AM - +263 71 427 4635: They are all excited for me and supportive
179 - 12 Jan 2024 10:35AM - Pallika Edoofa: Kudzashe,  I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
180 - 12 Jan 2024 10:35AM - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone*  *1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.  *2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.  *3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university. Do you know about other requirements?
181 - 12 Jan 2024 10:46AM - +263 71 427 4635: No i dont
182 - 12 Jan 2024 10:46AM - +263 71 427 4635: Yes
183 - 12 Jan 2024 11:07AM - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child‚Äôs eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

186 - 12 Jan 2024 11:17AM - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn‚Äôt meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.  The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year‚Äôs annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
187 - 12 Jan 2024 11:17AM - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes,  *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *Earn While You Learn Program and training* *University sessions and selection* *A guaranteed scholarship seat* *Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
196 - 12 Jan 2024 11:51AM - +263 71 427 4635: Yes
197 - 12 Jan 2024 11:58AM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
198 - 12 Jan 2024 11:58AM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.

Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-  *About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.* *Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.* *The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
202 - 12 Jan 2024 12:37PM - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,  *Edoofa‚Äôs Website- www.edoofa.com* *Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*  *Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

182 - 12 Jan 2024 10:30AM - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.

So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
164 - 12 Jan 2024 11:18AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

168 - 12 Jan 2024 12:26PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers! So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?

Also by studying abroad I will be exposed to modern technologies which are not available on this part of the continent, it will be an honor
72 - 12 Jan 2024 01:17PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: B.Tech. Mechanical  *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course  First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.  Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.  Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:  *Production Engineering* *Industrial Engineering* *Manufacturing Engineering* *Automobile Engineering* *Artificial Intelligence*  The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.  *Mechanics*  Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine  *Mechatronics and Robotics*  Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.  Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).  Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.  *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*  Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.  Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.  *Design and drafting*  Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.  Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.  Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

124 - 12 Jan 2024 01:00PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
125 - 12 Jan 2024 01:00PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
126 - 12 Jan 2024 01:00PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

140 - 12 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Makanaka! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
141 - 12 Jan 2024 02:35PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
142 - 12 Jan 2024 02:36PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
148 - 12 Jan 2024 03:00PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: - The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are: Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
149 - 12 Jan 2024 03:00PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics
150 - 12 Jan 2024 03:00PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
151 - 12 Jan 2024 03:00PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
152 - 12 Jan 2024 03:12PM - +263 77 743 8652: I think its a great programme and lm sure l will benefit a lot because lm getting to earn money for my education while l get an opportunity to learn more about the programme lm under taking at the same time being helped by the best in the industry
153 - 12 Jan 2024 03:45PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
154 - 12 Jan 2024 03:45PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
155 - 12 Jan 2024 03:45PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
156 - 12 Jan 2024 03:45PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.
157 - 12 Jan 2024 03:45PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
197 - 12 Jan 2024 04:06PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
198 - 12 Jan 2024 04:06PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
199 - 12 Jan 2024 04:06PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
200 - 12 Jan 2024 04:07PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your  - *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* - *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* - *Earn While You Learn Program and training* - *University sessions and interactions* - *A guaranteed scholarship seat* - *Visa Documentation Assistance* - *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
201 - 12 Jan 2024 04:08PM - +263 77 743 8652: Wow
202 - 12 Jan 2024 04:38PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
203 - 12 Jan 2024 04:38PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
204 - 12 Jan 2024 09:15PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please let me know.

Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.  The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

166 - 12 Jan 2024 09:16AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: - The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are: Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
167 - 12 Jan 2024 09:16AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics

168 - 12 Jan 2024 09:16AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
169 - 12 Jan 2024 09:17AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
170 - 12 Jan 2024 09:24AM - +260 97 7744035: Yes certainly
171 - 12 Jan 2024 09:44AM - +260 97 7744035: This is wonderful am now excited about this program
172 - 12 Jan 2024 10:09AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2000 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $60-$90 a month
173 - 12 Jan 2024 10:09AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
174 - 12 Jan 2024 10:10AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1000 in the first semester and $1000 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
175 - 12 Jan 2024 10:10AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

196 - 12 Jan 2024 10:12AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how Taizya can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on her parents?

198 - 12 Jan 2024 11:14AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I‚Äôll have to add that I‚Äôm flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
199 - 12 Jan 2024 11:14AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

207 - 12 Jan 2024 01:45PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
208 - 12 Jan 2024 01:50PM - +260 97 7744035: Yes
218 - 12 Jan 2024 02:47PM - +260 97 7744035: That a student can pay his or her finances by themselves through the Earn While you Learn Program
219 - 12 Jan 2024 02:47PM - +260 97 7744035: Edoofa program helps give students a privilege to become part of the Edoofa program with the program fee $350
220 - 12 Jan 2024 02:53PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.  *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350  *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program. <This message was edited>

222 - 12 Jan 2024 03:04PM - +260 97 7744035: We have discussed,1,2,3,4,5 and we are on 6
223 - 12 Jan 2024 03:53PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  *Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.  *Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
224 - 12 Jan 2024 03:56PM - +260 97 7744035: Yes please
225 - 12 Jan 2024 03:57PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

However, since Rutendo is in school and you are occupied with work during the day, it seems that the same challenge in connectivity is going to persist for the next couple of months as well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly.

15 - 12 Jan 2024 11:15AM - +263 77 637 1431: I also prefer Edoofa because the cost of education at our local universities is an uphill climb.University of Zimbabwe and other universities are charging 850Usd per semester.After graduating employment opportunities are as scarce as hen's teeth.Edoofa offers an opportunity to be employed in India while furthering my studies
16 - 12 Jan 2024 11:56AM - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail
17 - 12 Jan 2024 11:56AM - Shubham Madhwal: *Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the information, and be transparent and active throughout the counselling session and Evaluation*  So are we good to begin your session?

19 - 12 Jan 2024 01:03PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
20 - 12 Jan 2024 01:03PM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

13 - 12 Jan 2024 12:36PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!  You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
14 - 12 Jan 2024 12:36PM - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

For the past few years we have experienced anumber of pandemic like coronavirus and Ebola which took many precious lives .To me those hard experiences drew me closer to wanting to explore more on how we can find cure or even prevention from such infections.Also during my Olevel I lost a friend due to blood pressure and diabetes which only came to light after she was already no more ,it made me more interested in wanting to know what happenes to the human body , how does one get such diseases, what needs to be done to avoid it and how to go about checking on your health, getting tested and getting treated.Also my father there some  diseases which later came to light after his passing on which he was never tested or get any treatment.Thus these are among other cases which drew me to wanting to be a lab technician running tests and trying to find cure to various infection and as for me I believe it works hand in hand with being a pharmacist.

56 - 12 Jan 2024 07:12AM - +263 77 717 1803: Saint Faith's high is the school that I studied at previously.  It is located about 10km from Rusape town in the Manicaland province.  Saint Faith's developed to become one of the best schools in the country, a powerhouse of academic excellence.  Students from all walks of life appreciated the education system because of its uniqueness and desire to succeed.  Saint Faith's is a school that is not only recognised for its academic performance but also a school gifted with a great sporting culture and vibrant ethnic values (Ubuntu).  Saint Faith's helped me to become what I am today.  Even when I was a day scholar, I was exposed to great opportunities.  I became a talented volleyball player and became a member of the school team.  We managed to participate in the Zimbabwe NASH (National Association of School Heads) competition.  Moreover I even developed academically with the resources they provided.  My technical skills improved greatly.  I was an outstanding student in Technical Graphics at O Level.  I was also the best student in Mathematics in Form 2 in all the Anglican schools in the district.  I also became a strong  Christian believer , a problem solver, practical and acquired skills to adapt to situations in society.  I had activities that I participated in for my holistic growth.  Being a member of the volleyball team and participating in national sports events I developed to be cooperative and influential in teamwork.  I was also a nominee for the Mathematics Olympiad and represented my school, Saint Faith's.  We performed but unfortunately we only qualified for Round 2.  We were unable to participate in the last round.  One thing that I loved about Mathematics Olympiad is that during the process, I believe, I developed intellectually throughout understanding mathematical concepts.  I also improved my problem solving skills.

79 - 12 Jan 2024 03:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
80 - 12 Jan 2024 03:16PM - +263 77 717 1803: We are confident.  As indicated in earlier messages Runyararo sat for 5 A Level subjects:. Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Technical Graphics and Additional Maths.  We should make it!

78 - 12 Jan 2024 02:29PM - +263 77 717 1803: Yes we can proceed.
79 - 12 Jan 2024 03:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
80 - 12 Jan 2024 03:16PM - +263 77 717 1803: We are confident.  As indicated in earlier messages Runyararo sat for 5 A Level subjects:. Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Technical Graphics and Additional Maths.  We should make it!
81 - 12 Jan 2024 03:46PM - Shubham Madhwal: Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?
82 - 12 Jan 2024 04:14PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it‚Äôs been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.  Have a good day ahead.

15 - 12 Jan 2024 10:43AM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains! <This message was edited>
16 - 12 Jan 2024 10:43AM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
