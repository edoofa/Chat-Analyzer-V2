12/12/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 308 6466: Okay so in order to pursue the Neuroscience course l also need A level physics
12/12/23, 3:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Russell. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with your A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
12/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 308 6466: Yes you may
12/12/23, 3:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that you could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are
