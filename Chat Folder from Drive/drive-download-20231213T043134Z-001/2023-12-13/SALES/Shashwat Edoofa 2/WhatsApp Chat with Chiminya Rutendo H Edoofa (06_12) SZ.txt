11/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 584 4314: Total.          9 points
11/12/23, 10:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! That information will suffice for now but I believe you will be sending the documents as well.
11/12/23, 10:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
11/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 71 584 4314: Yes l will

11/12/23, 10:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge this question?
11/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 584 4314: Ever since I was a little girl I always had great admiration for nurses .i admired the way they kept hospitals clean and helped all the patients get well  from there on I decided I wanted to be a nurse.so being a nurse was childhood dream
11/12/23, 6:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Rutendo, could you please share why you didn't pursue Physics, Chemistry, or Biology in your A level?

I believe they are very crucial science/medical subjects, isn't it?
11/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 71 584 4314: The school which I attended didn't offer sciences so I didn't have a choice but to partake in commercials
11/12/23, 6:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand your perspective, Rutendo. However, I will have to inform you that the minimum threshold that you need to fulfill in order to pursue Nursing/ Medicine is Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in your A-Level, please.
11/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 584 4314: Yes I am aware of that  but I am willing to venture into something in the field of commercials
11/12/23, 6:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?

11/12/23, 7:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Rutendo. I appreciate your aspiration to venture into the field of "Commercials." However, it's important to note that "Commercials" is a broad term encompassing various career domains such as Management, Accounting, and more. To better understand your preferences, could you kindly specify the particular domain or aspect within "Commercials" that captivates your interest the most?
