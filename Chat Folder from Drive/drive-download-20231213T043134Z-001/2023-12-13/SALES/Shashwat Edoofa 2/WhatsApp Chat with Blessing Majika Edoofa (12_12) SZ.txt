12/12/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 157 1664: I'm Blessing Majika aged 19, I'm the first born in our family and I have two little sisters and a little brother. My father works as a refrigerator and air conditioner technician with his job and the help of my guidance and counseling teacher who later paid for my form 6 fees since my dad was not able to due to the illness and death of my mother which required a lot of money, I was able to learn at Kwekwe High School from form 1 up to 6. I passed my ordinary level with 6 out of 9 subjects and proceeded for A level. I took the combination of three sciences subjects which were puremathatics, biology and chemistry. As of now I'm waiting for my results. My hobby is singing and I'm interested in helping myself and others keep their health by staying fit and exercising. My ambition is to become a doctor, specifically a surgeon my family inspired me to have this dream it all started when I used to give my grandma her medications and also when I used to check my parent's blood pressure and advising them to take the proper diet and exercises, if anyone of my family members were sick i would always help them in any way possible and this all led up to me having this dream to one day help the sick.
