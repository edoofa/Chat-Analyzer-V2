12/12/23, 12:36 pm - Arshita: Good to know more about you!
12/12/23, 12:36 pm - Arshita: I hope you are aware that studying abroad involves a financial aspect. May I know who will support you financially with your education abroad?

12/12/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: Have you confirmed the same with them?

12/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 570 4241: Yeah l once controlled the sewage system machine the previous year
12/12/23, 12:45 pm - Arshita: Noted! 

To take your evaluation forward can you please share your O and term results of form 5? 

Pictures will be better
12/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 570 4241: I sent but,there is poor network connection 🤦🏽‍♂️
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: Will wait for the network
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
12/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 570 4241: Thank You
12/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 570 4241: Of course l am confident on passing all of them and am sure l will pass
12/12/23, 12:51 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 570 4241: Not yet mam l don't have any links🤦🏽‍♂️...I will be glad if you send me some
12/12/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
12/12/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics , Chemistry and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 3:45 pm - Arshita: Since you do not have chemistry, you are not eligible for civil engineering. 

At the same time do you have any alternate career aspirations?
