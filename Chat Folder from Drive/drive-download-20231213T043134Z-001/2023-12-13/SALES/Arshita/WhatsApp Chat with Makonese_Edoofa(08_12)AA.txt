12/12/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 385 2628: I am answering on Levy's behalf as the parent. At the moment we are at separate locations. What motivated us was the success we saw on the presentation from the main group. Exposure to international learning platforms was another motivator. Since Levy's main area of study are sciences with an inclination to Crop Science Edoofa Scholarship may assist him in fulfilling his ambitions.

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

12/12/23, 9:25 am - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

Can you please share more about him, what kind of child he is, his qualifications and career aspirations?
12/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 385 2628: Levy is well behaved child. He has been given leadership responsibilities since primary school. He was a prefect at ZRP Braeside Primary School. Currently he was selected as a prefect at Gutu High School. We have never been troubled by him both at school and at home. He is an above average student. He did well at O' Level. Currently he is studying Crop Science, Statistics, Biology and Geography for his A' Level.
12/12/23, 9:44 am - Arshita: Good to know about him. He truly is an amazing child. 

May I know what are his career aspirations?
12/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 385 2628: He wants has interests in Agriculture.
12/12/23, 9:54 am - Arshita: That is well noted.

12/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 385 2628: He is going Form 6 next year
12/12/23, 9:55 am - Arshita: That is well noted. 

To take his evaluation forward can you please share his O level and term results of form 5? 

Pictures will be better.
12/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 385 2628: Okay I will do so once I get the reports.
12/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 385 2628: What I know is that at 'O' level he got 1A, 4Bs and 4Cs
12/12/23, 9:58 am - Arshita: Noted
12/12/23, 9:58 am - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about him achieving it.
12/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 385 2628: Definitely we will encourage him to do that. This last term he got 12 points
12/12/23, 10:01 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 385 2628: We haven't infact, we had no idea how to go about it. This came as gift
12/12/23, 10:04 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
12/12/23, 10:04 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 10:04 am - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
12/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 385 2628: I am done very interesting. So there scams out there on scholarships?
12/12/23, 10:12 am - Arshita: Yes, a few people do that!
12/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 385 2628: Okay I can see what will be their benefit?
12/12/23, 10:13 am - Arshita: Based on my evaluations, considering his subjects, interests and passion, he is eligible to pursue

12/12/23, 10:16 am - Arshita: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
12/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 385 2628: I know India as a source of so many things. On a lighter note, BOLLYHOOD. On a more serious note, the best doctors come from there, the best mathematicians, technology, medicines. Quality products etc the list is endless. How can I not know the land of Mahatma Ghandi
12/12/23, 10:20 am - Arshita: Good to know about your knowledge
12/12/23, 10:20 am - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
12/12/23, 10:20 am - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
12/12/23, 10:20 am - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
12/12/23, 10:20 am - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
12/12/23, 10:20 am - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
12/12/23, 10:20 am - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
12/12/23, 10:20 am - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
12/12/23, 10:20 am - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.
12/12/23, 10:20 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>

12/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 385 2628: Great so I was right. India is a fountain of knowledge
12/12/23, 10:23 am - Arshita: By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
12/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 385 2628: No like I said this was an eye opener
12/12/23, 10:24 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 10:25 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 10:25 am - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to you?
12/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 385 2628: Yah it can  be affordable. Just  that our situation may be fluid sometimes.
12/12/23, 12:17 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
12/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 385 2628: No may you explain further.
12/12/23, 12:24 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
12/12/23, 12:24 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
12/12/23, 12:24 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
12/12/23, 12:24 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/12/23, 12:24 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
12/12/23, 12:24 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje

12/12/23, 12:24 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 12:24 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
12/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 385 2628: Yes definitely. If it is fair and non-exploitative
12/12/23, 12:26 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

12/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 385 2628: Okay we will consider that
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
12/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 385 2628: The work while you learn one
12/12/23, 12:33 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

12/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 385 2628: Great that's amazing
12/12/23, 12:36 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
12/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 385 2628: Okay well noted
12/12/23, 12:37 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
12/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 385 2628: Okay
12/12/23, 12:39 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
12/12/23, 12:39 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
12/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 385 2628: Yes go ahead
12/12/23, 12:51 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
12/12/23, 12:51 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
12/12/23, 2:16 pm - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 2:45 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule.
