*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Luyanda?*
23/11/23, 11:17 am - +260 97 6182543: 1) My motivation to apply for Adoofa scholarship program is due to the fact that all  adoofians are pursuing their careers with a wide range of opportunities offered by the scholarship program.Not only that the program make it possible for African students as in my case to go and study my dream career offered by best schools in India despite having financial challenges.I was also motivated to apply for this program because of Love, care and support the adoofian's mentor they offer to the students.This proves enough the ground of Guardianship.
23/11/23, 11:37 am - +260 97 6182543: Our discussion was quite interesting, firstly I understood that the program mainly help the deserving students (such as upper six students, former A level students even lower six).Apart from that I came to know that the program is not 100% sponsorship. However,there is also a perspective of earn while you learn which enables students to self finance their education and career.The program unlocks the great potential in various scholars with a view to  imparting skills, knowledge and confidence in students for their preparations to participate in the global arena
23/11/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail

23/11/23, 12:14 pm - +260 97 6182543: Yes
23/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*.

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
23/11/23, 5:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
23/11/23, 10:34 pm - +260 96 3408171: Well 
As the father for Stermon Malambo, let say just a little on how much I know Edoofa while already appreciating the programs such as the Scholarship on offer and the services you as an Institution provide to learners, 
In a nutshell let me just say I say yes for the programs and services you are about to offer my son.
Go ahead and help him by unlocking set backs in order for him to attain greatness for programs, services and any other related issues related to scholarship alongside it.
For me I agree,
Stermon Hang'ombe

01/12/23, 12:38 am - +260 97 6182543: As you already know my name,I was born on 4th June,2004 and bred in Choma district,the provincial capital of southern province in Zambia.As the first born son of Mr and Mrs Malambo,who raised me morally upright and full of integrity.I have six brothers and no sister,the first four after me, are all in school while the other two are young and still being nurtured at home.


I started school in 2012 and completed       my senior level( grade 12) this year in November.Following my school academic history and lifestyle, ever since I started my junior secondary course in 2019,I developed a good acumen in scientific subjects basically Physics, Chemistry and Biology. From there on I participated in several academic activities such as QUIZ, DEBATE, READING,a little bit of CHESS and many others. I even joined clubs such as SOSTAZ,BUSTAZ,RATAZ,NASAZ, and most important JETS( Junior Engineers Technicians and Scientists) in which I came the best in senior quiz and physics Olympiads category in the entire district this year.


I would like to study medical sciences because I believe that my intellectual ability and constant passion for learning will not only bring person development but also it will find community growth.


Currently both my father (Mr Malambo) and mother (Mrs Malambo) are self employed.My father works as a welder while my mother as a sales woman(marketeer) she sells greens. They both do this with a view to catering our needs for survival.


My father completed his senior secondary education ( grade 12) and studied short courses of ICT and psychosocial counselling.


Ever since I started schooling my parents have been supporting me with school basic necessities from grade one(1) until grade twelve (12). Fortunately, when the new government came into power in 2021 the burden was reduced when it introduced the Free education policy.


As for my financial support abroad,for now I have no one to help me reach the stars(🌟). Nevertheless,I am hoping to get excellent results and apply for sponsorship from the government or any other well wisher organization that maybe interested in my pursuits and ambitions.


My former school is Swan secondary, located in Choma district of southern province.The school is not far from Njase Girls secondary (the institution you mentioned earlier).When I started learning at this school I paid 600 Zambia kwacha, fortunately,the fees were reduced to 200 Zambian kwacha by the former government. Finally came the new government in 2021 and established the Free education policy which abolished paying any fees at school from grade one (1) to twelve (12).

As for that Mr Shubham sir,I believe that,as an individual we are all born with a set of certain traits,talents, creativity and imaginations but all these together, requires proper guidelines and principles for them to be realized in fullest.These principles and guidelines can be obtained in learning institution such as colleges and Universities.

That's a brief I can say about myself.
01/12/23, 9:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Stermon, How are you?
01/12/23, 10:51 am - +260 97 6182543: Good morning sir
01/12/23, 10:51 am - +260 97 6182543: I sent something about myself
01/12/23, 11:26 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
01/12/23, 11:26 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
01/12/23, 11:39 am - +260 97 6182543: Yes sir, very available
01/12/23, 11:44 am - +260 97 6182543: You can start sir.
01/12/23, 12:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, what all activities did you participate in your school for your holistic growth?
01/12/23, 1:29 pm - +260 97 6182543: During my school period at Swan secondary school,I engaged my self in various activities such as ENGLISH DEBATE AND PUBLIC SPEAKING, ENGLISH AND SCIENCE (chemistry, physics and biology) QUIZ, CIVIC EDUCATION AND GEOGRAPHY PAPER PRESENTATION, BUSINESS STUDIES PRESENTATION AT JUNIOR LEVEL.In other school activities I was in the school basketball 🏀 team in which we competed with schools such Choma secondary and so on. To be Frank,the school has played a major role in my holistic growth in a such way that I was able to apply the skills and knowledge I acquired in every field of competition encountered. Some of the major things the school had done to bring about my holistic growth, was to expose me to various events and exhibition. For instance this year I was accorded an opportunity to deliver a vote of thanks during the flagging off of desks by the ministry of education at St Mawagalu college(Choma)

Apart from that, I was assigned to present a school Art Department gallery during the  Civil Servants Day exhibition this year.

Due to this exposure I realized that it is possible to fullfil my dreams despite financial status.

Studying has been an adventure since I started school,I discovered new things every day.The school provided the medium studying environment. Despite being not accorded full conducive studying environment I managed to handle the  obstacles by changing my studying routine. <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 2:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e. the picture of your results for Grade 10-Level and results for Grade-12.
01/12/23, 3:03 pm - +260 97 6182543: Okay

01/12/23, 3:30 pm - +260 97 6182543: Sir here are my grade-12 results
01/12/23, 3:31 pm - +260 97 6182543: <Media omitted>

02/12/23, 9:41 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
02/12/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 6182543: I am doing well Sir,thank you for that warm greeting.
02/12/23, 9:50 am - +260 97 6182543: Indeed you can start the discussion.
02/12/23, 10:15 am - +260 97 6182543: I hope you have noticed, I sent the grade 12 results for last term.
02/12/23, 11:35 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes Please I have!
02/12/23, 11:37 am - Shubham Madhwal: So Stermon, I can see that you have opted for Arts subjects in Grade-12 where as we you wish to purse Medical Sciences for higher education, Can you eplain/
02/12/23, 11:52 am - +260 97 6182543: Actually Art and Design was my optional Subject,I always wanted to know more about history of art. But that was not my desire as a career, as I mentioned earlier I enjoy discovering new things every day.If you noticed SCIENCE SCORE(98%) was handwritten at the bottom, this was done because the results for science were missing when my former class teacher was compiling the results. Fortunately they found the results and write them at the bottom. However,that score in science is very authentic I can assure you that. Giving me a reason to pursue medical sciences.
02/12/23, 12:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted, I skipped that,
So Why have you not opted for Pure sceinecs?
02/12/23, 12:20 pm - +260 97 6182543: At my former school, pure sciences were not provided. But since grade 10 I have been studying pure sciences (especially physics) and Cambridge biology syllabus on my on.    I even had an opportunity to participate in Junior Engineers and Scientists (JETS) this year, where I competed in pure physics Olympiads and senior quiz and scooped the first position in both categories.

04/12/23, 10:35 am - +260 97 6182543: The weekend was amazing, I had a nice time as I was going through the links you shared.

04/12/23, 11:27 am - Shubham Madhwal: As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
04/12/23, 11:38 am - +260 97 6182543: Generally I have already researched the requirements for Medine. But not specifically in India.
04/12/23, 12:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
04/12/23, 12:12 pm - +260 97 6182543: So like in my case where I only have *science* and *biology* I don't qualify or?
04/12/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 6182543: Is this means I am not *eligible*?
04/12/23, 1:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as the majority of the time, Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
04/12/23, 1:37 pm - +260 97 6182543: Okay, Sir now I need your help, which one would you prefer that I should pursue in accordance to how you have seen my partial qualifications?
04/12/23, 2:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please I would like to ask you to first individually  research about these courses and then I would be able to assist you better
04/12/23, 2:08 pm - +260 97 6182543: Okay I will do that today right away, Any other Questions Sir.

07/12/23, 11:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
07/12/23, 12:09 pm - +260 97 6182543: Studying abroad does not only provide quality tertiary education but it also provides various opportunities during and after the studying period. That's one of the reasons I want to study abroad.
07/12/23, 12:13 pm - +260 97 6182543: Apart from that I also believe that if I am exposed to International education I will not only develop my holistic growth but also the betterment of communities by providing professional expertise, efficiency and competency.
07/12/23, 12:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
07/12/23, 1:09 pm - +260 97 6182543: I have not applied to any University abroad.
07/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
07/12/23, 1:17 pm - +260 97 6182543: All I know is that *Bachelor* of *Science* is about 20,000 to 200,000 in INR <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 1:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
07/12/23, 1:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 1:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
07/12/23, 1:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 1:32 pm - +260 97 6182543: Wow! this is great news, I can't wait for my grade 12 results to be out.

09/12/23, 12:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
09/12/23, 12:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
09/12/23, 12:37 pm - +260 97 6182543: First of all, the EWYL program is a real deal in this cosmopolitan world. This is because the 21st century has displayed rapid civilization changes which can be seen through industrial revolution growth and digital or computer era which is now termed as *space* *age period*. With these advancements it's very important for individuals to be updated and ready to adapt to these modern changes.

09/12/23, 12:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
09/12/23, 12:41 pm - +260 97 6182543: As in my case,I am 100% sure that the  EWYL program will benefit me in different angles of life.On top of that,there is no doubt that the communities will benefit as well. <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
09/12/23, 12:56 pm - +260 97 6182543: According to my understanding,the picture briefly illustrates the stages involved in getting into the Edoofa scholarship program.For instance like in my case, I assume that I am in stage 01.
09/12/23, 1:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
09/12/23, 1:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/12/23, 1:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
09/12/23, 1:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
09/12/23, 1:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
09/12/23, 1:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
09/12/23, 1:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
09/12/23, 1:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/12/23, 1:11 pm - +260 97 6182543: *Noted*.
09/12/23, 1:12 pm - +260 97 6182543: So the fees are they in US Dollars or?
09/12/23, 1:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please. Before we proceed ahead are there any questions you would like to ask?
09/12/23, 1:46 pm - +260 97 6182543: If I was to qualify,do I  need to wait for *August* *2025* *intake* or I can still be picked in *August* *2024* *intake* ? <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 2:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please you can still continue for 2024
09/12/23, 2:36 pm - +260 97 6182543: I will be *grateful* for that.
09/12/23, 2:50 pm - +260 97 6182543: I am looking forward for *August* *2024* *intake* .
09/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
09/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
09/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
09/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
09/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
09/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
09/12/23, 3:32 pm - +260 97 6182543: The most interesting thing,is the aspect of *affordability* *through* *guaranteed* *scholarship*. Most African students who desire to pursue their careers abroad find it difficult to afford all necessary requirements to fit into the international education system not just because they can not compete but due to financial challenges.In my case this aspect is totally amazing and worth given to deserving students from Africa and other marginalized regions across the world. <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 4:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
09/12/23, 4:13 pm - +260 97 6182543: I saw it in the previous texts you sent.
09/12/23, 4:17 pm - +260 97 6182543: Yes, you did. <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 4:18 pm - +260 97 6182543: Yes.
09/12/23, 4:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
09/12/23, 4:26 pm - +260 97 6182543: That's *great* news! <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
09/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
09/12/23, 4:32 pm - +260 97 6182543: Great!
09/12/23, 4:35 pm - +260 97 6182543: So like in my case,here in Zambia where November Exam's results are expected in January- February period, what step can I take?
09/12/23, 4:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me assist you with the same
09/12/23, 4:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
09/12/23, 4:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).
09/12/23, 4:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
09/12/23, 4:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/12/23, 4:51 pm - +260 97 6182543: Now that is crystal clear.
09/12/23, 4:53 pm - +260 97 6182543: Thank you Sir for making me understand my current situation and burning flame of desire to accomplish my dreams.
09/12/23, 4:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
09/12/23, 4:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
09/12/23, 4:59 pm - +260 97 6182543: 1.How is the enrollment fee paid here in Zambia?
09/12/23, 5:00 pm - +260 97 6182543: 2.After you have succeed where are the interviews conducted?
09/12/23, 5:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please if you are selected then the details will be mentioned in your acceptance letter, But if you recall that I shared that Penmal Connect are our associates there in Zambia, you can complete the formalities through their accounts!
09/12/23, 5:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please the interview are conducted online!
09/12/23, 5:03 pm - +260 97 6182543: Understood.

09/12/23, 6:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Excellent, Attempt, Let me sum it up for you. So that you are clear with all the information
09/12/23, 6:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1.Well Edoofa Scholarship Program is an innovative program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. under the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative that solves the problems of Affordability and Employability in Higher Education by enabling students to Earn Scholarship Credits and Learn 21st century job skills.

The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.

So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?

11/12/23, 12:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
11/12/23, 1:04 pm - +260 96 3408171: Yes
11/12/23, 1:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So *@260963408171*, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that *Stermon* would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
11/12/23, 1:59 pm - +260 96 3408171: 1. Medical Science

2. India

3. Between $6000-$8000

4. For the selected students who are able to qualify for the *EDOOFA Program* by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to *$2000-$3000* per year. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation

5. The *enrollment fee* was $750 but due to this pandemic, you understand the problem faced so you have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.Students might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

6. The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

7. Understood. <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 2:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please to correct you on question 1, The course Stermon opted for was *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*
11/12/23, 2:19 pm - +260 96 3408171: Ooho ! my bad I have forgotten that he recently changed because of the subject consideration. Anyway thanks for the correction, you can proceed with that please.
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted Please!
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@260963408171*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
11/12/23, 2:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@260963408171* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Stermon* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then *Stermon's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
11/12/23, 2:39 pm - +260 96 3408171: *Understood*.

11/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *17th or 18th of December 2023* for $200 and the *16th or 17th of January 2024* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *17th or 18th of December 2023*

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
11/12/23, 3:42 pm - +260 96 3408171: Right now I am not *financially* *prepared* .
11/12/23, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate please?
11/12/23, 4:10 pm - +260 96 3408171: For now I am in kind of hard moments in terms of financial stability. I am a simple welder who tries to make a little for my family to survive but this does not mean that my child does not deserve quality tertiary education. He is working hard to succeed in this scholarship program by making sure that he does not go offline.


Right now he continues studying Advanced Level topics during the day and at night with a view to performing excellent  incase he is granted the *Edoofa* *scholarship* *program* to go and pursue his career in *India*.  Everyday he thinks of the ways to find the money for *enrollment* *fees* , *passport* and *visa* *expenses* I myself I am not surprised because he assured me that he will definitely pass the grade 12 exams with flying colours. <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 4:19 pm - +260 96 3408171: Despite not knowing where we will find the money to support him ( *Stermon*) in a case he becomes eligible for your program, he never  loses *hope* in *Edoofa* *scholarship* *program*. He once told me that, "Father soon or later God will answer our dreams, I see *Edoofa* to be the *gateway* to our dreams.
11/12/23, 4:21 pm - +260 96 3408171: So yes Mr Shubham that's just a grimps of our situation here.
11/12/23, 4:25 pm - +260 96 3408171: And for this, that's a reason I too continue supporting him because the *burning* *flame* in his *heart* is *glowing* *brighter* and *brighter*.

12/12/23, 4:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
