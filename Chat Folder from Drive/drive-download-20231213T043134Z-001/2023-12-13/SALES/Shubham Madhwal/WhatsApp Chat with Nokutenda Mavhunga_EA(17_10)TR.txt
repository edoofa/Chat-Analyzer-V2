18/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 401 7640: Ok thank you ma'am
18/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 401 7640: Yeah it is a program which was built towards helping students to get higher education  and it is also helping students from different parts of the world
18/10/23, 3:06 pm - Tushti: That is correct
18/10/23, 3:06 pm - Tushti: Adding to your knowledge you see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/10/23, 3:07 pm - Tushti: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School.

18/10/23, 3:07 pm - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
18/10/23, 4:25 pm - Tushti: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow  at 09:00 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

19/10/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 401 7640: My name is Nokutenda Shantel Mavhunga.I'm currently doing my final year of Alevel at Pfupajena High 
Chegutu in Zimbabwe.Im a girl aged 19.I love maths 
I would love to study pharmacy.
19/10/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 401 7640: I'm currently studying pure mathematics, chemistry and geography
19/10/23, 10:37 am - +263 71 401 7640: My mom is a teacher and my father is a retired police officer and he is now working as a security
19/10/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 401 7640: I have two brothers
My elder brother is 25 and he graduated for an advanced diploma in logistics and my younger brother 11 currently in grade 5
19/10/23, 10:53 am - +263 71 401 7640: Both of my parents have been helping with education and l just thought it would be better if l apply for a scholarship and help my parents.This would also help me academically
19/10/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: Thank you
19/10/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: Please answer the last question before we can proceed further, dear
19/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 401 7640: It's $80 per term
19/10/23, 10:58 am - Tushti: Noted
19/10/23, 10:58 am - Tushti: So, do tell me what motivates you to study pharmacy
19/10/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 401 7640: I always wanted to do something under the health sector but l was confused on which program to study until l met with someone who is a pharmacist,she explained everything to me and l was interested so l thought would be great if l do the same program
19/10/23, 12:04 pm - Tushti: That's amazing
19/10/23, 12:05 pm - Tushti: I shall brief you about the course next, but before that, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your parents to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are your parents facing such a situation?
19/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 401 7640: Ok thank you 
What are the expected results for one to study pharmacy in India
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
19/10/23, 4:31 pm - Tushti: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow  at 10:00 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
19/10/23, 10:28 pm - +263 71 401 7640: After completing my study l would look for a job earn some money and with time l would  open my pharmacies and provide prescribed medicine to patients.I want to be successful in life and help my parents with the kind of life they always wished for. I'm sure if it wasn't for our education they could have been somewhere by now. It would be great if l manage to make them proud of me by being a respected and successful person in life. And also anything to do with food has always been something l love  and l hope that someday I would be able to open my own restaurants.

So the  future me l see is a successful person with recognized pharmacies and restaurants
20/10/23, 10:04 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?

20/10/23, 4:18 pm - Tushti: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow  at 10:00 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/10/23, 7:33 am - +263 71 401 7640: Good morning
I'm sorry for the late responses my network is quite bad and it's  also due to the examinations in progress
21/10/23, 7:35 am - +263 71 401 7640: Due to the low income here in Zimbabwe teachers are no longer teaching as they used to.And l also think that if l study abroad I'll also have high opportunities of working there as well because jobs are not easy to get here in Zimbabwe
21/10/23, 10:04 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?

21/10/23, 12:09 pm - Tushti: Very well
21/10/23, 12:10 pm - Tushti: You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

21/10/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 401 7640: Wow this is great. Studying in India will be a  dream come
21/10/23, 12:25 pm - Tushti: I am glad you feel so
21/10/23, 12:25 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
21/10/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 401 7640: We researched about it, asked some people and we found out that the fees ranges from $500 USD and above
21/10/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
21/10/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/10/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/10/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/10/23, 1:47 pm - Tushti: In simple words, Nokutenda what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/10/23, 3:05 pm - Tushti: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

25/10/23, 11:09 am - Tushti: So now if you have no further questions, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
25/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 238 9017: Yes please i was abaout to ask that.
25/10/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
25/10/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
25/10/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

25/10/23, 11:12 am - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
25/10/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 238 9017: Waaauuu thats wonderful,so are the students not strained on doing that extra work
25/10/23, 11:16 am - Tushti: No, dear, the work is well balanced with the studies and has no interferance
25/10/23, 11:16 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
25/10/23, 11:16 am - Tushti: @263772389017 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/10/23, 9:57 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?

30/10/23, 9:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Nokutenda and Mrs Mavhunga @263714017640 @263772389017, How are you?
30/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
31/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
