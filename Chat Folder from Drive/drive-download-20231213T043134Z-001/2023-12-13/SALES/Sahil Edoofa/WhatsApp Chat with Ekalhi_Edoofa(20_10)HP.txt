EKALHI MAGANGA is my second born daughter ,born in 2005 on the 25 March.

She's been at ILINGA PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOL in the northern region of Malawi were she got her Malawi Schools certificate of Malawi
21/10/23, 10:02 am - +265 999 27 84 64: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 10:12 am - +265 999 27 84 64: Well EKALHI has always wanted to purse a course in the Medical department ,,,it has always been her passion and its what she has always worked hard and prayed for.

Well my daughter as far as I know her as a parent,she's that type of a girl who really loves working hard ,she believes that hard work pays 
She's also into looking out for the sick and the elderly people she loves to visit them and encourage them  

Again she loves to read and is also curious about things , she likes praying too and she's a very honest child .

Well she's really motivated to see different doctors looking out for the sick and vulnerable  and loves to see the youth having a great impact on the society to as looking out for the well been of people .....she doesn't like to see people in pain of their different sickness, she always wants to help out.
21/10/23, 10:14 am - +265 999 27 84 64: And one more thing she likes to speak out for her self  .....thus the other thing I know about her
21/10/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed, Mr Maganga, Its a pleasure to know about her!

She surely seems to be a hardworking and a dedicated student who has a kind heart and wishes to do well for people.

Along with the same I can see that you mentioned her fondness for reading, which is a great quality please.
21/10/23, 10:21 am - +265 999 27 84 64: Sure Sir , reading is her best hobby
21/10/23, 10:23 am - +265 999 27 84 64: And it very much inspires me to see her determination and dedication toward her passion .
21/10/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Mr Maganga.
21/10/23, 10:25 am - +265 999 27 84 64: Thank you very much
21/10/23, 10:28 am - Harmehak: So Mr Maganga, from what you shared so far, I believe you must have done thorough researches as well.

So did you ever happen to research about international education including the requirements to study medicine, since you mentioned Ekalhi wishes to pursue her studies in medical department?
21/10/23, 10:51 am - +265 999 27 84 64: Well Ms Harmehak 

Honestly speaking I haven't done much of the research but somehow my neighbors had the opportunity for their kids to go learn in the USA .....

And after that my daughter was so moved she wanted the same chance so after taking a few researches ,I found out that they were at Norfolk School in Malawi of which after passing their exams thus when they got the scholarships  but I also realized that it needs very nice distinctions and very great credits and great performance ,so thus when I had to ask my brother MR HALMITON MAGANGA if their could be a chance and thus when he introduced us to YOU SIR


Frankly speaking in relation to pursuing a course in the Medical department .....it needs someone who's really good at science subjects and a strong determination and sacrifices from the students ,inorder to get the chances, so I was inspired to try it out for my daughter for she's really good at science subjects .
21/10/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing and I can see the drive Ekalhi has to pursue her interests.

It's great to see you thoroughly supporting her and trying your best to provide well for her dreams.

So did you learn about the requirements to pursue medicine in India after you were introduced to Edoofa?
21/10/23, 10:58 am - +265 999 27 84 64: Well honestly nothing much only that after being introduced to EDOOFA looking at my daughters grades,she had to fill out a form which was submitted.
Well we have all been hoping to hear more from YOU and EDOOFA itself .
21/10/23, 10:59 am - +265 999 27 84 64: Since we didn't have much access to as how it operates and all its requirements.
21/10/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: Alright please and I completely understand what you are sharing, Mr Maganga.

May I know under Medicine, what exactly is Ekalhi intrigued towards?

For instance drug making, surgery, etc.
21/10/23, 11:53 am - +265 999 27 84 64: Well may I know all the course you offer
21/10/23, 11:59 am - +265 999 27 84 64: Based on medical department
21/10/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
21/10/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: *1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue

Above being the reasons, it is unfortunate that we donot offer Medicine.
21/10/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: But I realize that she wants to do a course that makes you, the parent proud and also align with her passion. So she can go ahead with the courses like:

*1. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*
*2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy*
*3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*4. Bachelors in Optometry*
*5. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology* 

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
21/10/23, 3:35 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Firstly, has always been my dream to study abroad. I believe that studying would give the access to a better and advanced study the benefits of my country,thus because most of the abroad countries are better developed than my own country MALAWI ...... meaning that they also are likely to offer the best so that I become someone of a great impact at large .

This will help me access information and knowledge about a huge variety of diseases to as what causes them and how best should we provide the right medication. This will also help me have access to knowledge of some medications that are rare in my Country and find a better way to provide it to my country and help life of people if the needful arises.

And it will create a better difference between my fellow Malawian in terms of the knowledge and the service we can offer.......so this opportunity will not just help me and my family but also my country too.
21/10/23, 3:36 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Sorry I might have missed some needed prepositions in the shared information due to some typing errors.....hope you will understand.

Even when am using some of the best medication I get from hospitals they indicate India which just inspires me.
Even soap soaps dealing with sink care they also indicate India.

And when researching about countries who are great at the medical department India is also there, so you see, seeing all this gives me a push and that desire to study in India ....so that I can also be one of the best. 

And also one interesting thing I have heard is that ... India is also known to have high population of people which gives some risks at easy disease transmission of disease but it is still the best in providing the best treatment and does it's best at providing a safer environment for it's people ...that really inspires me.
21/10/23, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: That's surely an admirable knowledge and awareness that you possess, Ekalhi!
21/10/23, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

21/10/23, 4:25 pm - +265 998 88 93 55: Thanks  for the add
21/10/23, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, Mrs Maganga.

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor, Mr Piyush- The head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
21/10/23, 4:28 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Wow ...this actually surpasses every of my imagination and knowledge about India to is really just a nice ... inspiring and motivating country to get the best education from.
21/10/23, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: I am glad very this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Ekalhi!


So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
21/10/23, 4:34 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Not much but I have a friend who's in the US at one college known as WAYNE STATES COLLEGE through the NORFOLK SCHOOLS IN MALAWI but to be honest how she explains it ... it's very expressive and not so affordable and accessible by many .... unlike India's ...from your shared information about it.
21/10/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Ekalhi.

I can see you have some awareness !
21/10/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/10/23, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/10/23, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/10/23, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 4:39 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Which is really  good ...and giving opportunities for the deserving students to learn from the best and become better citizens
21/10/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Ekalhi.

In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are your thoughts on the same?
21/10/23, 4:45 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Well it sounds great and so much accommodative ....giving everyone the chance to pursue their dreams.
21/10/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to have you share your appreciative thoughts, Ekalhi!

On that note let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist both you and your family!
21/10/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/10/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/10/23, 4:55 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

21/10/23, 5:06 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Well I understand but not so well ......
21/10/23, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: Ekalhi, If I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/10/23, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: I hope now you have a better clarity, Ekalhi?
21/10/23, 5:15 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Well yes ...that sounds better now, I understand it now .....so on the monthly pay ....if one is really working hard and earning more of the credits will it still require the parents to pay or ??
21/10/23, 5:16 pm - Harmehak: The credits would only depend on your hardwork, Ekalhi!
21/10/23, 5:16 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/10/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: Did you have a look at the credits that our Proud Edoofians did earn in one month?
21/10/23, 5:21 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Yes ...I did 
Looks like Persistance Muza made alot  ...he must have really worked had
21/10/23, 5:21 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Hard*
21/10/23, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, he is one of our Star Performers!
21/10/23, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to have you thoroughly following, 

So Ekalhi, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
21/10/23, 5:27 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Yes am ready
21/10/23, 5:27 pm - Harmehak: Ekalhi, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
21/10/23, 5:27 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/10/23, 5:32 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: $1500-$2250
21/10/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/10/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
21/10/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: Ekalhi, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
21/10/23, 5:35 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Oky thus great
21/10/23, 5:35 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Thus better indeed
21/10/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
21/10/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/10/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/10/23, 5:40 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Understood
21/10/23, 5:41 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Well thus true ....and it now sounds for even my parents too
21/10/23, 5:41 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: But u mean this fee is paid monthly or during admission only
21/10/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Its a one time payment itself please,

Which is paid once you are found eligible and you receive an acceptance letter please!
21/10/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
21/10/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
21/10/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
21/10/23, 5:49 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Understood now
21/10/23, 5:50 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Sorry network was tripping
21/10/23, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please!
21/10/23, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: Did you understand the steps too?
21/10/23, 5:51 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Well  i have gone through it .
21/10/23, 5:52 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Atleast yes i do
21/10/23, 5:53 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Well not really ....but I think thus were I'll have to go through some tests right?
21/10/23, 5:54 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Ooo right I really understand now ..sorry I misread the information but now I do at least.
21/10/23, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please, Ekalhi!
21/10/23, 5:58 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Well thank you
21/10/23, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/10/23, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
21/10/23, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
21/10/23, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 6:01 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Well I think I understand ....
21/10/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: That's good, Ekalhi!

So far do you have any doubts or queries please?
21/10/23, 6:03 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Not really much doubts ...just that am thinking about the fees and all that ..... hopefully Dad and Dad together with Mom will consider it
21/10/23, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, we do understand!

Feel free to share any queries that may arise too!
21/10/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
21/10/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/10/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

23/10/23, 12:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: No problem, these details can be a bit overwhelming at first. Have you had a chance to discuss this information with your family? It's important to ensure everyone is on the same page and fully understands the process.
23/10/23, 12:47 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Yes I had the chance to discuss with them though  seemed  to have understood too well but again now I believe we missed this poy

23/10/23, 12:56 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: But did I really missed the points???
23/10/23, 1:06 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: I see that I confused the enrollment fee that was reduced from $500-$1000 to $350 with the annual fee with the EDOOFA program which is $6000-$8000  which was reduced to $2000-$3000
23/10/23, 1:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: No worries at all; it's completely understandable that these details can be a bit overwhelming at first. It's great to hear that you discussed the information with your family.

Regarding your question, just to clarify, the enrollment fee has been reduced from $750  to $350(The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days ), while the annual cost of education with EDOOFA has been reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000. It's essential to distinguish between these two amounts.

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

MY ASPIRATION STORY 

My academic life has been a wonderful experience of my life. I normally had to be recognized by my teachers and peers for my well achievement in most of our academic tests and language tests. I was taking 8 subjects Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Agriculture, Geography, English, Mathematics and Chichewa but out of all the 8 subjects I came out with the most strongest credits after out final year examination. I'm passionate to learn and achieve my goals and because of my interests in reading and attention to details, it has really impacted my academics in the most pleasant way . Thus because it gives me the ability to study more about the human body and how different chemicals interact with the body , these two strengths have really pushed me towards my passion and goal of becoming a Health Care Profession like a pharmacist so that I ensure that drugs are available in my country this indeed inspires me alot.
23/10/23, 4:52 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Am done
23/10/23, 5:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me share this with our team for evaluation.
23/10/23, 5:09 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Oky
23/10/23, 6:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Waiting for this
23/10/23, 6:13 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Oooo oky fyn
23/10/23, 6:13 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Fine*
23/10/23, 6:41 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 7:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Africa is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Africa, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Africa has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many African families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
23/10/23, 7:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 2000+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

23/10/23, 7:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 28th or 29th October 2023 for $200 and the 28th or 29th  of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 28th or 29th  of October 2023.
23/10/23, 7:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

24/10/23, 9:51 am - Sahil Edoofa: Alright Mr Innocent, so I had a chance to discuss Ekalhi's application with the Board once again. As per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, after careful consideration, they are willing to consider that if Ekalhi is found eligible for the Edoofa Program and if the student/family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 then you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, and remaining $100 could be completed in the next 7 to 10 days. Moreover, the pending amount of $150 is to be paid in the next 30 days.  All in all for $350 you will have about 45 to 50 days to complete the formalities.

Considering your situation, and valuing our long standing relation with Sir Muganga as well, I believe this financial plan would be convenient to you and your family please?
24/10/23, 9:58 am - +265 999 27 84 64: If my Ekarhi is found eligible, will fight to help her rich her vision as she always say to her the sky is not the limit. She beleaves there is something beyond the sky.
24/10/23, 9:59 am - Sahil Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Mr Innocent, so looking at the following arrangement, shall I share tomorrow's interview slots with you please?
24/10/23, 1:16 pm - +265 999 27 84 64: Lets share it

26/10/23, 11:30 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning 
How are you doing today ?@263772452564 @265999278464 @265998889355 @265888287628
26/10/23, 11:45 am - +265 888 28 76 28: Morning
26/10/23, 11:45 am - +265 888 28 76 28: Been meaning to ask you something ....thus if it's oky
26/10/23, 11:46 am - Sahil Edoofa: Sure @265888287628
26/10/23, 11:46 am - Sahil Edoofa: Do tell me please?
26/10/23, 11:51 am - +265 888 28 76 28: Well if am eligible am I guaranteed that EDOOFA would offer me a fully funded scholarship like 100%
26/10/23, 12:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How would you define a fully funded scholarship, and who typically qualifies for it?
26/10/23, 12:20 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Well I've always known it as a schoolarships thus fully financed
26/10/23, 12:20 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Only the one who is eligible
26/10/23, 12:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please reframe your response.
26/10/23, 12:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please share the criteria ?
26/10/23, 1:00 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Well I have gone through the document again ...and unfortunately I missed some points thus why I was getting myself confused 

I'm really and extremely sorry for everything, my apologies for that .
26/10/23, 1:02 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Am extremely sorry for the inconveniences , my sincere apologies.
26/10/23, 1:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @265888287628 there is no need to appolozie, let me help you have a better clarity.
26/10/23, 1:19 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Thank you for understanding
26/10/23, 1:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: A lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*
26/10/23, 1:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Malawi with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Malawian Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.
26/10/23, 1:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
26/10/23, 1:25 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: Well thank you ....that clarifies it all .
26/10/23, 1:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now @265888287628 while Edoofa offers scholarship upto 100% on tuition and accommodation.
26/10/23, 1:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
26/10/23, 1:35 pm - +265 888 28 76 28: NO
26/10/23, 3:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please share your email address
27/10/23, 8:11 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning  @265999278464 @265888287628 @265998889355

I really appreciate and thank you for your kindness in accepting my daughters eligibility. Now am running around to raise and send the money as agreed. I thank you EDOOFA for giving my family this chance for your quality higher education, I can keep on talking throughout becouse of my happiness.
31/10/23, 7:59 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning @265999278464
31/10/23, 7:59 am - Sahil Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words please. I hope you have gone through the Letter of Acceptance properly by now, is there anything you would like to ask?
31/10/23, 12:22 pm - +265 999 27 84 64: No question so far may be as we go along.
31/10/23, 12:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright @265999278464, actually I wanted to ask you since you are in Malawi, would you be planning to complete the formalities from Malawi or you would like Sir Muganga to complete the formalities through Zimbabwe please?
31/10/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @265999278464 @263772452564 Are we connected please?
31/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 245 2564: Greetings, from the bottom of my heart, I am grateful to Edoofa for this scholarship to our daughter for her to be able to realise her dreams, as you continue touching lives may the Lord expand Edoofa's territory, thank you very much. Was talking to my big Brother, perhaps the processing will be done from the Zim side if all goes well.
31/10/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words @263772452564
31/10/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263772452564, from Zimbabwe you can complete the formalities through our Associate. Shall I brief you about the same?
31/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 245 2564: Indeed, thank you.
31/10/23, 2:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263772452564 basically there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe
31/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 245 2564: I Will take option 2
31/10/23, 3:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So @263772452564 basically in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
31/10/23, 3:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

31/10/23, 3:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: *For your utmost clarity, here I attach Mr. Charles's Passport*
31/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 245 2564: Thank you for sharing the information,  there is the option of breaking down the payment into 2 , how does that work with Mr Charles
31/10/23, 3:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You can break the fee down, you can complete $200 +12.5% before 6th November in the first part and $150+12.5% in the second part before 6th December 2023
31/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 245 2564: Thank you very much for the guidance
31/10/23, 3:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You're welcome, @263772452564. While I do understand that the deadline is on November 6th, as an early applicant, your niece would be eligible for a benefit throughout the entire admission process. This would be possible only when her process is started with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the month of October 2023. This, in turn, would help you to interact with the Admission Team even earlier so that you can have much better financial planning with them.
31/10/23, 3:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: It would be much more beneficial for Ekalhi incase you manage to complete a part of the formalities on or before 31st October which happens to be today.
01/11/23, 1:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Day @263772452564 @265999278464

06/11/23, 1:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @265999278464 is it possible for you to complete the formalities through Mama Money?
06/11/23, 1:47 pm - +265 999 27 84 64: To complete from Malawi Nation Bank they need aleter from the school with full details, My ID and Ekarhi's ID. And becouse of the scarcity of currency, they aply to their head office so it can take two to three days to get the currency.
06/11/23, 1:53 pm - +265 999 27 84 64: The bank says they aletter from the school with all the bank details here then they will print it out
