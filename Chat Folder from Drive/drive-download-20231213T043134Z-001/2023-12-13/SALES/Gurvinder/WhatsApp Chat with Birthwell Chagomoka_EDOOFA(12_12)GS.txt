12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 73 815 1871: I have learnt that the Edoofa program was initiated by Anhad  Edutrain Solutions Pvt, . Ltd , lndia. The Edoofa believes that quality education should be accessible to all and not just privilege of a few. Through their scholarship program that is based on work study model, Edoofa solves problems, that of lack of affordability and of employability in higher education. Edoofa stays with students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from the building the application, applying to colleges, training and making them job ready. That's all l have learnt
12/12/23, 6:24 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
