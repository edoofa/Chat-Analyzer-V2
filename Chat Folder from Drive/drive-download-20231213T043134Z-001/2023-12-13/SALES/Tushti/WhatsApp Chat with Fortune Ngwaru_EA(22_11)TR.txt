12/12/23, 11:42 am - Tushti: Even after a 100% scholarship, the family would have to cater to expenses such as food, transport, accomodation, etc
12/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 096 0718: Yes
12/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 096 0718: Its ok

12/12/23, 12:01 pm - Tushti: In case the student gets selected into the Program, an enrollment fee of $350 would have to be paid in the next few days <This message was edited>

12/12/23, 12:19 pm - Tushti: Let me brief you about the courses you are eligibel for, meanwhile
12/12/23, 12:19 pm - Tushti: Fortune, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 12:19 pm - Tushti: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are  


1. Bachelor in Pharmacy

12/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 096 0718: Ok
12/12/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: Would the family be able to afford around $4000 per year required for this course?
12/12/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: Kindly ask them to come online and answer
12/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 096 0718: Is 4000 inclusive per year,and how long will be course
12/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 096 0718: We may need assistance since it is so high
12/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 096 0718: We are expecting expenses for food accomodation transport
12/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 096 0718: We take note of this so this amount isnt for expenses
12/12/23, 1:11 pm - Tushti: The amount of $4000 would be inclusive of all expenses
12/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: The duration of the course would be 4 years
12/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 096 0718: With or without scholarship
12/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 096 0718: Is this amount included when you have a scholarship
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 096 0718: I think there is need for clarification
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - Tushti: Yes, the cost of education without scholarship would be around $9000 per year
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - Tushti: Therefore after a 50-100% scholarship, I believe the cost could come down to around $4000
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Tushti: This message was deleted
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 096 0718: We have to discuss as family first because his 1st choice is Pharmacy.....
12/12/23, 1:57 pm - Tushti: BSc in Medical Lab Technology is yet another smart choice

12/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 096 0718: I would prefer to start with pharmacy.
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 096 0718: So I as a parent I support Fortune's desire.
12/12/23, 2:37 pm - Tushti: Would the family be able to afford $4000 per year?
12/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 096 0718: Im sure you talk of 50-100% that means it might be less or equal then we do  according to the pass rate
12/12/23, 2:53 pm - Tushti: So, the family wishes to proceed with Pharmacy, then?
12/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 096 0718: Yes
12/12/23, 3:05 pm - Tushti: Noted
