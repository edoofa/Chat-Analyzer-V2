I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
17/11/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 524 7837: Sorry l have been busy lately I've been writing exams at school  .... I'm facing a challenge the time u will be up for the discussion l will be at school that's wy I'm unable to respond to your messages l can only be free during the weekend
17/11/23, 10:55 am - Tushti: In that case, my dear, can't your parents participate on your behalf?
17/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 524 7837: My mom is attending to my sick grandmother at the moment and my daddy is at work
17/11/23, 12:02 pm - Tushti: Well, dear, if there is no participation on the group, the application would be cancelled

17/11/23, 12:10 pm - Tushti: Noted
17/11/23, 12:10 pm - Tushti: Do tell me what your thoughts on India are
17/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 524 7837: Well I've always seen India on TV shows and movies and the impression it gives is good but l would like to see that for myself I've noticed that there is a friendly nature and  l like that
17/11/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: I hope this helped
17/11/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
17/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 524 7837: No we ain't maybe u could give me a highlight
17/11/23, 1:51 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
17/11/23, 1:51 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
17/11/23, 1:51 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/11/23, 1:51 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 1:52 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
17/11/23, 1:52 pm - Tushti: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
17/11/23, 4:51 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 9:29 am - Tushti: Hello , Good afternoon, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
18/11/23, 1:23 pm - Tushti: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Tuesday at 09:30 am. Please be online during your session time!

22/11/23, 9:42 am - Tushti: Did you understand the cost of education? I hope you discussed the same with your family?
22/11/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 524 7837: Yea l did understand
22/11/23, 9:44 am - Tushti: What did your family have to say about the same?
22/11/23, 9:59 am - +263 78 524 7837: They'll try their best to meet up with the fee arrangements
22/11/23, 10:05 am - Tushti: Noted
22/11/23, 10:05 am - Tushti: Now, let me brief you about the EWYL Program
22/11/23, 10:05 am - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/11/23, 10:05 am - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/11/23, 10:05 am - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/11/23, 10:06 am - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
