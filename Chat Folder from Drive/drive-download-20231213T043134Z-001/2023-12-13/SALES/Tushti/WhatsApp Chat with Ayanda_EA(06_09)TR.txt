14/09/23, 9:08 am - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a po insitive response from you soon.
21/09/23, 9:52 am - Tushti: Good day Ayanda,

I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Tushti

lm good hope you are well too

thanks for.your response 
yes we can start
11/12/23, 11:28 am - Tushti: I hope the family is now prepared to have the session with me?
11/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 624 2210: l hope soo too
11/12/23, 12:23 pm - Tushti: Are the parents online?
11/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 624 2210: They are not online but l stay with them
11/12/23, 1:10 pm - Tushti: Well, their participation is mandatory in the sessions
11/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 624 2210: alright
11/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 624 2210: They will participate
11/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: Noted
11/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
11/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 624 2210: lm not really sure
how much is it cost with scholarship and without scholarship
11/12/23, 1:14 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
11/12/23, 1:14 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/12/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/12/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/12/23, 1:15 pm - Tushti: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 624 2210: noted
11/12/23, 1:19 pm - Tushti: Does the family find this affordable?
11/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 624 2210: so when you select your students 
how will select you take those who manage to pay fees
11/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 624 2210: l think they wil not afford that cost
11/12/23, 1:24 pm - Tushti: I would like for your parents to come online and discuss the same with me
11/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 624 2210: okhy here is
11/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 624 2210: mom
11/12/23, 1:25 pm - Tushti: Is she using the same number?
11/12/23, 1:26 pm - Tushti: In that case, I would request her to use voice notes to communiacte
11/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 624 2210: yes
11/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 624 2210: noted
11/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 624 2210: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:30 pm - Tushti: Thank you for joining us
11/12/23, 1:31 pm - Tushti: I would like to understand from you what the family's min source of income is and how the family has planned to manage the finances involved in Ayanda's higher education abroad
11/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 624 2210: you are welcome
11/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 624 2210: As a family  our source of income comes from our tuckshop. 
We have planned that she will study abroad if she get a schoolarship that is 100%
11/12/23, 1:38 pm - Tushti: I see
11/12/23, 1:38 pm - Tushti: And if she does not get such an opportunity, will she continue her education in Zimbabwe?
11/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 624 2210: Yes she will continue at Zimbabwe
11/12/23, 1:40 pm - Tushti: May I know how you would manage the finances involved in that case?
11/12/23, 1:40 pm - Tushti: Our Academician Mr Piyush visited Zimbabwe in the month of March this year for around 70 days to conduct various workshops for the students regarding the Edoofa Program, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly $1100 is spent on just food while the cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, and travelling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
11/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 624 2210: Thus true but the government pays school fees for her
11/12/23, 1:48 pm - Tushti: Would the government support her at tertiary level. too?
11/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 624 2210: that is not possible
11/12/23, 2:02 pm - Tushti: In that case, the fsmily would have to provide the fees at tertiary level, isn't it?
11/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 624 2210: This message was deleted
11/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 624 2210: we should try
11/12/23, 2:08 pm - Tushti: So, the family would have to raise around $2000
11/12/23, 2:08 pm - Tushti: How would that be possible?
11/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 624 2210: she will need to stay gap year and then return to school following year
11/12/23, 2:11 pm - Tushti: Well, that does make sense. However, if I might suggest, she can instead enroll with Edoofa and start earning herself with our Earn While You Learn Program, just like all our other students
