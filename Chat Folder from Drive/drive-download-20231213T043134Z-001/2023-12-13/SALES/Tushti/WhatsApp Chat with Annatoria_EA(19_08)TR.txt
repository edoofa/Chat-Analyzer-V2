19/08/23, 9:53 am - Tushti: Offers 50% what, dear?
19/08/23, 9:56 am - +263 71 148 6114: I don't know if the information is correct but heard that it only offers 50%of the scholarship
19/08/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: You are not properly informed, dear. Let me brief you about the program
19/08/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/08/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School.

19/08/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/08/23, 10:02 am - +263 71 148 6114: Okay thank you
19/08/23, 10:02 am - +263 71 148 6114: Yes it's true
19/08/23, 10:05 am - Tushti: Okay so Annatoria, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/08/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 148 6114: Yes
