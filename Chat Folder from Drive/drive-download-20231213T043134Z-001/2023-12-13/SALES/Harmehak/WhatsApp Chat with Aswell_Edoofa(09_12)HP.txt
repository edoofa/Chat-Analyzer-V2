11/12/23, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Are they willing to support you financially and mentally too?
11/12/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: I am glad they are supportive
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
11/12/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes im confident
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Actuary ?
11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile do go through the shared video to learn more about the experience of our Proud Edoofians.

12/12/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor's degree in Commerce can provide a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences. Actuarial Sciences is the study of mathematical and statistical methods for assessing risk in the insurance and financial industries. Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:

Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.

Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.

Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.

Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques. Actuaries can attend professional development events, participate in continuing education programs, and stay informed of industry news and trends.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field. Actuaries are expected to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the insurance and financial industries, and must continuously update their knowledge to stay relevant in the field.
