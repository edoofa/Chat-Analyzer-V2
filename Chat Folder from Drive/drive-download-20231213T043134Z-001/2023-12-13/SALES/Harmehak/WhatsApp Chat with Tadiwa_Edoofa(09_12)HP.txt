It's a pleasure to know about them

I can see your parents lead a family that values education.
11/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yess they really try to get us educated by all means
11/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 438 9968: All the boys in my family are very talented soccer players and my mother has a diploma in business administration

11/12/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Well Tadiwa now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
11/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I believe higher education abroad is a life changing decision as it will give you an opportunity to interact and share ideas with international students. There is nothing more beneficial than being exposed to interaction with people from different countries. I believe my career path requires that. Higher education abroad also helps us to bring back ideas to home countries which allows global connection to make the world one place.
11/12/23, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: Very well put across, Tadiwa.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
11/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I am mentally prepared Ms Harmehak. The passion of wanting to study without financially burdening my parents has  helped me to prepare.
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwa, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
11/12/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yes my family members are aware and they are delighted to support me mentally but financially to  a lesser extent.
11/12/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate regarding financial aspect, Tadiwa?
11/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 438 9968: The total amount of money that my parents earn is not enough to support all the 5 children in our family. My parents encounter a lot of expenses such as school fees, food as well as clothes and other rentals so it becomes difficult for them to support the five of us.
11/12/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Tadiwa 

So how are you planning your higher education in India?
11/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 438 9968: My mother is saving from her salary every month

12/12/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: And did you thoroughly read the document?
12/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 438 9968: Yess I did Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
12/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 71 438 9968: Edoofa is a program which aims at helping deserving students to study abroad and acquire high education at a very affordable prices and internship programs. It provides students with skills through practical training and the earn while you learn program. It also provides students with career guidance and mentorship.
12/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 71 438 9968: And as for the financial aspect of the program, Edoofa is not a charity organization hence does not offer fully funded scholarships to everyone. It only helps to offer education at lower and affordable prices. However students can be able to fund their education through the earn while you learn program by acquiring scholarship credits which enables them to pay their fees.
12/12/23, 9:47 am - Harmehak: That's great,

I am glad you thoroughly read the document,

So do you understand the following too?
12/12/23, 9:47 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 438 9968: I understand Ms Harmehak.
12/12/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you for enlightening me.
12/12/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Did you happen to discuss everything with your parents too?
12/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 71 438 9968: Yess I did
12/12/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: What all did you discuss with them, Tadiwa?
12/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 71 438 9968: We discussed that India is one of the best country in terms of studying medicine and pharmaceutical or even engineering. Well cultured nation,that accepts everyone from different nations and they will try by all means to get me there. My parents are also eager for me to come they vowed to make ends meet for me to come and pursue my education. My mother also has been doing side hustles besides earning a salary.
12/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: I am glad you had a thorough discussion and they were supportive,

So are they thoroughly willing to support you financially, Tadiwa?
12/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss. They are willing to support me.
12/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
12/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 438 9968: I understand. Thank you
12/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Pharmacy ?
12/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 438 9968: At O level.. I did 11 subjects and i came out with 6As 4Bs and 1 C
At Alevel i took Maths, Physics and Chemistry.
12/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Duly noted
12/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 71 438 9968: My motivation to do pharmacy is the urge to help others and deliver medication where it is needed. I have seen a lot of my relatives struggling with diseases such as diabetes hence i would like to be the one who helps them access the medication needed. I am a person who also likes to work with patients directly. I have also discovered that i can earn a living from pharmacy which allows me to uplift my family. I also want to be an important member to the community
12/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing, Tadiwa, I can see you have a kind heart that only wishes to do well.

On that note, let me brief you about your desired course.

12/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 438 9968: Yess Ms Harmehak. Thank you
12/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me once done.
12/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 438 9968: I am done reading. Thank you
12/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Alright then Tadiwa, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 438 9968: In 5 years time, i see myself owning my own pharmacy and having discovered a different type of medication that cures a certain disease which is different from those already discovered. I also see my self as a graduate who has valuable work experience and knowledge who is able to also create opportunities for those that want to follow the same path.
12/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 438 9968: Edoofa will enable me to achieve my dreams by creating a favorable environment where i can interact with other students who know better and through high education at an affordable price. It will also help me to acquire the required practical skills through internships and learning
12/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 438 9968: Edoofa will also enable me to achieve my dream by learning how to help people as they would have helped me also
12/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 438 9968: I am sorry Ms Harmehak. My network is a bit slow
12/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 438 9968: I also see myself building an all in one pharmacy which caters for the less previledged and having a joint venture with pharmaceutical manufacturers in India who can supply medicines at a cheap price so that the less previlege benefit too
12/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: I understand please
12/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: That is really great Tadiwa, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you
12/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 438 9968: I would want to study abroad because there are better learning facilities and opportunities. My career path deals with interating with different patients from different races and studying abroad will make me familiar with people from different nations. In most cases patients in our country when they need quality healthcare they're flown to India for best medical assistance hence i want to study there. India has top notch equipment and offers the best in healthcare. Even raw material of drugs mostly comes from there.

12/12/23, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly go through the shared resources, Tadiwa?
12/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss. I am still reading the images
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: That's good,

You can inform me once done.
12/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I am done Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful,

Did you find the information interesting and helpful, Tadiwa?
12/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yess I did
12/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I think i am familiar. From the document you gave me yesterday, i think its from $ 8000-$9000 without any scholarship
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Very correct
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Noted. Thank you
12/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
12/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I think it is a very good program because it instills a sense of independence by learning while earning. It also gives people an opportunity to study despite their financial situations.
12/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Ms Harmehak,If i may ask despite earning credits are learners allowed to do part time jobs or it is also considered as illegal in the document due to the student visa and not work visa?
12/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please
12/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: You cannot work in India on a student visa please.
12/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Okay thank you
12/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwa, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss i agree. Cost of living in Zimbabwe is high ans people tend to struggle to make ends meet.
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Indeed,

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tadiwa?
12/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yes Ms Harmehak. Thank you
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I understand.
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/12/23, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: I understand please
12/12/23, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: You can inform me once you have gone through.
12/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Okay
12/12/23, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yess i am
12/12/23, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/12/23, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 438 9968: About $1500-$2250
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tadiwa, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I understand
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Okayy thank you
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I think so Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Noted. Thank you
12/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I am done thank you
12/12/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful
12/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 438 9968: That is fair
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I understand
12/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yess. Thank you
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

12/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

12/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I'm sorry my network is slow so the videos and images are taking a while to download
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please,

You can go through the video once downloaded.
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well.
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Okay thank you.
12/12/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
12/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

12/12/23, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: Dear Tadiwa,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “13-12-23” at 10:30 P.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
