We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship.

12/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 714 4581: My family members are just as commited as l am and would be delighted with me studying abroad

12/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: I am glad they are supportive, Isheanesu.
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 714 4581: i am confident enough
12/12/23, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Civil Engineering ?
12/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 714 4581: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 714 4581: A level combination
12/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 714 4581: PURE MATHEMATICS
TECHNICAL GRAPHICS
GEOGRAPHY
12/12/23, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: Duly received,

What motivates you to study Civil Engineering, Isheanesu?
12/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 714 4581: It is a career worth taking
12/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 714 4581: It is a career guaranted to allow individuals to be self employed
12/12/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: That's great, and what all did you research regarding the requirements for engineering, Isheanesu?
12/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 714 4581: Its part of the most paying programmes of 21 first centuary
12/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 714 4581: its well in line with construction services
12/12/23, 4:12 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, 

However why did you pursue Physics since you wish to study Engineering, Isheanesu?
12/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 714 4581: physics was not an option at my previous school
12/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 714 4581: hence I compensated with technical graphics
12/12/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: I can understand
12/12/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Physics is a mandatory requirement to study Engineering even in Zimbabwe.
12/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 714 4581: Yes it is but
12/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 714 4581: Technical graphics can be used as a additional subject
12/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 714 4581: And in place of physics
12/12/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Indeed that's an additional subject however Physics and Mathematics are mandatory, Isheanesu.
12/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 714 4581: Then what are u suggesting sir
12/12/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 714 4581: what about architecture
12/12/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics are required.
12/12/23, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: I am Ms Harmehak please.
12/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 71 714 4581: Ok ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
12/12/23, 7:30 pm - +263 71 714 4581: agreed
