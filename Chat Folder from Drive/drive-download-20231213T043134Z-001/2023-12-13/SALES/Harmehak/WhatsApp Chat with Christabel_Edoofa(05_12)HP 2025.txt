08/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: That's great.
08/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
08/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 604 3267: I am confident she will do better if not best
08/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Mr Nhau.
08/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Mr Nhau, what exactly would Christabel like to study further please?
08/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 604 3267: In this case I am the provider and she there to choose whatever she like to study further.
08/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please, would she be able to share the same?
08/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 604 3267: Have just advised her to supply the required information
08/12/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please
08/12/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as I would be heading for an urgent board meeting, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

09/12/23, 10:28 am - Harmehak: Alright and what motivates you to study Medicine, Christabel?

09/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Well that's great,

However what intrigued you towards pursuing a career in Medical sciences?

What all did you research regarding your desired field?
09/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 369 4506: it has high chances of getting jobs here in Zimbabwe since there are few doctors. Although it took so many has l find that l will make so much money after seven years of struggling.
09/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: I do understand Christabel.

Did you ever happen to research regarding the requirements for Medicine, Christabel?
09/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 369 4506: Yaah someone who has passed biology and Mathematics and any other sciences subject . l should come out with 14-15 points on my A' level
09/12/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

And what is your take on the requirements of Physics as well to pursue Medicine?

Do you believe physics is a crucial science/medical subject?
09/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 369 4506: I do not they mainly need biology
09/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 369 4506: but would like to be a doctor is the any need of physics
09/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Yes please, it's a crucial science subject.

Since Medicine is all about human body and living beings, each one of Physics, Chemistry and Biology are a mandatory requirement.
09/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 369 4506: okay but now lm only doing Biology,Chemestry and Pure Maths
09/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

09/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Unfortunately you cannot pursue medicine with your combination.

Physics is a mandatory requirement.
09/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 369 4506: oky
09/12/23, 11:02 am - Harmehak: While I understand the same Christabel,

I would like to understand from you that what exactly in studies of medicine are you really looking forward to learning?

I believe you would agree that Medical sciences in itself is a vast field.

11/12/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Mr Nhau, Now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
11/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Isn't it, Mr Nhau?
11/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 604 3267: I don't have anything to say  only waiting for your positive response
11/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: I understand please, currently we are in the Counseling session for the same.

11/12/23, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Mr Nhau.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 604 3267: Not familiar but we wish so
11/12/23, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
11/12/23, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/12/23, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/12/23, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/12/23, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 604 3267: Noted
11/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Nhau, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
11/12/23, 5:13 pm - +263 78 369 4506: It will help me financially
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

11/12/23, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
12/12/23, 8:15 am - +263 77 604 3267: Noted
12/12/23, 9:19 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
12/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 604 3267: Good morning Ms Harmehak. I have just told her( Christabel) to be online so that you can go ahead with the discussion.
12/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Sure please, Mr Nhau.
12/12/23, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Did you follow the discussion from yesterday please?
12/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 604 3267: Yes I did follow the discussion
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 604 3267: Earn while you learn program helps a student by providing quality education at affordable fees cost
12/12/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
12/12/23, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 604 3267: Quite affirmative
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 604 3267: Yes I am ready
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: Mr Nhau, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 604 3267: It's far less cost to apply in one university than five
12/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: A student has to apply to more than one universities when applying by himself/herself as the chances for getting accepted are less too, so to cover the risk they apply to roughly 5 universities.
12/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: So a student tends to spend $1500-2250, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/12/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/12/23, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: You see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow, Mr Nhau?
12/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 604 3267: Affirmative
12/12/23, 4:25 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Christabel_Edoofa(05/12)HP" to "Christabel_Edoofa(05/12)HP 2025"
12/12/23, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/12/23, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/12/23, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 604 3267: well understood
12/12/23, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/12/23, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
12/12/23, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

12/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/12/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow, Mr Nhau?
12/12/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 604 3267: Actually I followed MsHarmehak
12/12/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

12/12/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

12/12/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

12/12/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Dear Christabel and Mr Nhau,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “13-12-23” at 10:30 P.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
