12/12/23, 9:38 am - Harmehak: That's great.
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
12/12/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 388 4904: Yes
12/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 388 4904: Ok that's great
12/12/23, 9:45 am - Harmehak: I believe you must be aware of Edoofa's association with Viola's school as well?

12/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Duly received Mrs Engelina.

From what you have expressed, she surely seems to be a great student who is dedicated and equally hardworking.

It's great to know that she is fond of exploring.
12/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 388 4904: ok thank you
12/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: So Mrs Engelina, what motivates Viola to pursue a career in Biotechnology or Agricultural Engineering please?
12/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 388 4904: Biotechnology has a potential to improve human health, increase food production especially in our society looking at the current situation in our country it also helps in devoleping new and sustainable energy sources for the people
12/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 388 4904: She also wants to pursue agricultural engineering because she has a passion in farming she always says that one day she wants to own her own farm where she would be carrying out her farm products such as crop production and livestock production
12/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: While I completely understand what you are sharing Mrs Engelina, I am glad she has a thorough understanding of her aspirations!

However did you or Viola ever happen to research about these two courses and fields please?
12/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 388 4904: Agriculture engineering also help create sustainable solutions to the world's growing food need, while also protecting the environment and also improving the lives of the people in the rural areas and also within the community
12/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 388 4904: Yes
12/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Indeed please
12/12/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: So what all did you learn regarding the requirements for both the fields please?
12/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 388 4904: They are both helpful in different ways
12/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Alright please.
12/12/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: You see, since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 388 4904: Ok noted
12/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, now considering her interests and subject combination, she is eligible to pursue the following:

*Bachelor of science in Biotechnology*
*Bachelor of science in Agriculture*
12/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Ok thank you
12/12/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: So which field is she more inclined towards out of the two, Mrs Engelina?
12/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 388 4904: Bachelor of science in biotechnology
12/12/23, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: B.Sc. Biotechnology
