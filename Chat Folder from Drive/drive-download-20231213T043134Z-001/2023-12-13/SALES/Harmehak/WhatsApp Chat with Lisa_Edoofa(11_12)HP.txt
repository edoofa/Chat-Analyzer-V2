12/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

12/12/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful please.

It's a pleasure to know more about Mr Moyo.

Mrs Caroline, I thoroughly appreciate your thoughts on the importance of education.
12/12/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 11:38 am - +27 71 869 3844: I am confident our daughter Lisa  will reach the required pass mark .
12/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Okay Lisa, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Software Engineering?
12/12/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: You can share on her behalf if she isn't available, Mrs Caroline.
12/12/23, 11:56 am - +27 71 869 3844: She was Studying Mathematics , Computer Science and Accounting at A Level
12/12/23, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Yes please, now considering her interests and subject combination, she is eligible to pursue the following:

*Bachelor of science in Computer science*
*Bachelor in computer application* <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 11:59 am - +27 71 869 3844: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 12:00 pm - +27 71 869 3844: We will send the PDF document if required .
12/12/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: You see, since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Physics is a mandatory requirement to pursue Engineering even in Zimbabwe.
12/12/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Received please
12/12/23, 12:07 pm - +27 71 869 3844: I do understand , COVID time was a very challenging time for all students.
12/12/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
12/12/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, now considering her interests and subject combination, she is eligible to pursue the following:

12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me once done please
12/12/23, 12:42 pm - +27 71 869 3844: I have read ,thank you.
12/12/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries please?
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 688 6249: I have read , thank you
12/12/23, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same, Lisa?
12/12/23, 12:54 pm - +27 71 869 3844: After the above discussion or chat that we have done .Would you be able to tell us if Lisa will qualify .

1. What other requirements would one need to have in order to be enlisted in the programme .


2.Is it a full Scholarship or is it a partial one.
12/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 688 6249: Yes
12/12/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Before I address the same, may I know your understanding of a full scholarship please?
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - +27 71 869 3844: I think it's when your fees and accommodation is fully paid
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Thank you for the clarity .
12/12/23, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome please
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Caroline, Now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Kindly elaborate on what the programme entails .
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +27 71 869 3844: What will be the requirements from you to us the parents .
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +27 71 869 3844: We are  also concerned about the safety and well being of our daughter,I think this would be every parents concern.
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* India is home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education. Students can choose from a wide range of disciplines, including politics, philosophy, engineering, medical sciences, biology, business, and media/journalism.

12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Caroline, let me help you have better clarity about the same please.

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Thank you for the update , I would presume that the pass rate is very high in the institute.?
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: The same would apply please.
12/12/23, 2:12 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Okay thank you for an interesting chat .I think a lot of questions have been addressed .
12/12/23, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mrs Caroline.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/12/23, 2:22 pm - +27 71 869 3844: I had an idea back then however I am not sure of the costs now .
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/12/23, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/12/23, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:33 pm - +27 71 869 3844: I understand.
12/12/23, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Caroline, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/12/23, 2:50 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Okay I understand , I noticed in the video that students spoke about getting credits.Kindly elaborate on that .
12/12/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
12/12/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/12/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/12/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/12/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:29 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Quite interesting
12/12/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you found it interesting.
12/12/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/12/23, 3:30 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Okay
12/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/12/23, 3:43 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Yes very much .
12/12/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/12/23, 3:59 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Yes
12/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Caroline, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/12/23, 4:12 pm - +27 71 869 3844: I am not sure
12/12/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: This is the case for students applying without Edoofa.
12/12/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: You would only have to calculate $300x 5 and $450x5 please.
12/12/23, 4:40 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Okay
12/12/23, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Kindly ensure active participation, Mrs Caroline.
12/12/23, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: So a student tends to spend $1500-2250, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/12/23, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/12/23, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Caroline, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/12/23, 4:49 pm - +27 71 869 3844: I do understand all the information provided , kindly advise what the conclusion would be .
12/12/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, we are on conclusive stage itself.

I shall connect you with a parent too.
12/12/23, 4:51 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Okay
12/12/23, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/12/23, 4:51 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Thank you for all the information, a further discussion will be done with the head of the family who is currently away on business .This will assist in making a more informed decision

.I did not think the discussion would have been so lengthy and take the whole day.as I have meetings from 6pm and I just want to ensure we have not missed any crucial information.
12/12/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing please and I am providing you with the resources for a family discussion itself.
12/12/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
12/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/12/23, 5:30 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Just for clarity, you require that we make a payment before we know that our daughter has qualified for the programme.In the event that she does not qualify , a refund will be done .Is it not better to wait for the results then secure a place first ?
12/12/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: You donot pay a single penny before she is found eligible.

I shall provide you with thorough resources for a family discussion after which you would proceed for a video call interview with the Program Director.

If/when she is found eligible for the program, the only you pay if you are ready to proceed ahead, she would receive a thorough acceptance letter for the same. <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission.
*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/12/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: *Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.*
12/12/23, 5:34 pm - +27 71 869 3844: Okay thank you for that .I would like to prepare for my meeting .We will have a discussion as a family and hope the information provided will be sufficient enough to update Mr Moyo.
12/12/23, 5:35 pm - Harmehak: That's surely alright please.
12/12/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: We start with the early admissions as this helps both the student and parent prepare for international education while you would agree that this requires time!

She would also start with her Earn While You Learn Journey as soon as she is a part of the program that too from Zimbabwe along with the admissions.
12/12/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/12/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
12/12/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
12/12/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/12/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

12/12/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/12/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
