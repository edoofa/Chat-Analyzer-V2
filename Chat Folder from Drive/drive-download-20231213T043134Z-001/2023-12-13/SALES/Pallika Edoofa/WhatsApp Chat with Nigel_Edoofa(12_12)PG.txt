Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 939 3473: The school didnt allow students to take both Physics and Biology once. Plus these two subjects had a clash when it came to lesson time. We were only permitted to take one of them

12/12/23, 3:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
