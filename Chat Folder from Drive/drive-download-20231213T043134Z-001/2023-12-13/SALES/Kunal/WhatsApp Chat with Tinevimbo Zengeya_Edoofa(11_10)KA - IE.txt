30/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing them. 
I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
30/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you for the update. I have confidence in Tinevimbo. I am expecting higher grades. He attends holiday lessons. He is focused and dreams big. I am committed to provide supportive resources.
30/10/23, 8:42 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *12:30 pm CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
31/10/23, 12:49 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon, everyone
How are you doing?
31/10/23, 1:18 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
31/10/23, 1:19 pm - Kunal: Based on my evaluations, considering Tinevimbo's subjects, interests, and passion, he is eligible to pursue

*Bachelor of Commerce(BCom)*

Do you want me to explain the course in depth? <This message was edited>
31/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 772 5401: In the event that Tinevimbo is enrolled under Edoofà Scholarship what am I supposed to prepare as a parent? I have learnt that English is one of the official languages . Are the beneficiaries trained in local language for easy communication while in India?
31/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Would you please send me some information on climatic characteristics of India? How does it differ with the Savannah climatic characteristics of Zimbabwe?
31/10/23, 2:17 pm - Kunal: Mr Christopher
You will get to know about every little detail we will proceed step by step ahead
Also after our counseling session, I would connect you to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
31/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Would you please give me some information on programme areas that are sponsored under Edoofà Scholarship scheme. Some programmes cover only Science related field others focus on Commercial field.  Does the scholarship cover all areas offered by Indian Universities?
31/10/23, 4:54 pm - Kunal: Let me share it with you
31/10/23, 4:54 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you for the communication. I have realized that there is a wide range of programmes covering different study areas.  In Zimbabwe, Diploma programmes are meant to accommodate Ordinary Level Graduates   while Degree programs are for Advanced Level students.  Are Indian Diploma programmes different from the Zimbabwean system?
31/10/23, 5:15 pm - Kunal: Yes, the Diploma programs offered by Indian universities may differ from the Zimbabwean system in some aspects. Indian Diploma programs often cater to a broader range of students, including those with various educational backgrounds. They are designed to provide comprehensive knowledge and skills in specific fields, allowing students to develop practical expertise and gain valuable industry insights. Moreover, Indian Diploma programs can serve as a strong foundation for further academic or professional pursuits.
31/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you for the information. Earlier,I gathered that Edoofa offers it's beneficiaries opportunity to learn and work. Do university students go for industrial attachment. How is it possible to earn and learn at the same time? In situations where one is academically more gifted are beneficiaries allowed to take up more than one programme? For example a beneficiary studying a degree programme intending to add a diploma. Is it allowed?
31/10/23, 5:24 pm - Kunal: That is right
We provide this opportunity through Earn While You Learn program about which we will be discussing further in our session
31/10/23, 5:24 pm - Kunal: So, do you wish to proceed witht his course?

31/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 772 5401: It is fine to proceed. Tinevimbo has already chosen a career path. My wish is to provide the necessary support so that he realizes his dream.  I have realized that we sometimes lack knowledge on career paths in developing countries. As a result our children end up being unemployed graduates. Computer studies and cyber security are on demand. Such programmes are either non existent or a preserve of a few.
31/10/23, 6:57 pm - Kunal: Good evening
Shall we proceed?
31/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Good evening. The Earn While You Learn Program is a welcome development for less privileged students. What kind of work do beneficiaries engage in . Are they employed in programme related work or other income generating projects. This to me is a welcome development. Considering that my son will be thousands of miles away, it will cover pocket money.
31/10/23, 8:04 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
Based on my evaluation, considering his subjects, passion and interests, he is eligible for

*BSc Computer Science*

01/11/23, 4:27 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued about your child to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on his career?
01/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 772 5401: If my son gets enrolled in Edoofà Scholarship scheme,he will have fullest exposure to supportive resources. Back home students experience challenges in getting enrolled for industrial attachment. Economic meltdown has resulted in shortage of highly qualified staff at local universities. Labour disputes disrupt learning. An opportunity to study in India would give him sufficient exposure to hands on experience. He would be marketable after completing training. This is non existent locally.
01/11/23, 5:47 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *9:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
03/11/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Good afternoon. I would like to inform you that we are having challenges with network signal. In our last discussion,I asked for clarification on the Work and Learn Program. Would you please enlighten me on that.
03/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kunal: Alright Before that let help you understand the financial aspects
03/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
03/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
03/11/23, 12:49 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
03/11/23, 5:21 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *10:30 am CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
03/11/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Sorry for erratic network. Thank you for the information on Tuition. The program is wonderful especially the Earn While You Learn. It affords the less privileged students.
04/11/23, 10:56 am - Kunal: Good morning
Let us be grateful for this new day of our lives. 

So I am here to continue with your application 

How are you this morning?
06/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Good afternoon sir. I am now free to continue our discussion. I was at my rural home from Thursday attending an illness. There are network challenges at my rural home. That is the reason why i wasn't online last week.
06/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: Alright please
I understand
06/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand more

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
06/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
06/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
06/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
06/11/23, 2:46 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
06/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Sorry. There was an interuption. The EWYL Programme is wonderful. It addresses challenges facing third world university graduates who often fail to secure employment due to company closures. The 
idea of real-time live online projects is excellent. I now have a clear picture of the whole program. It's something lacking at our local universities.
06/11/23, 3:23 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
06/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you for the information. The program is helpful to less privileged students struggling to raise fees.
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
06/11/23, 4:34 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
06/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 772 5401: After going through the given facts given, i have found all given points helpful and of equal weighting.  Most students rush to enroll for UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS without adequate knowledge on relevance demands in the world of work. Access to information help prospective students make informed decisions.
University education is now a preserve of the elite. Edoofà Scholarship addresses the affordability challenges.
Continuous guidance help students remain focused .
06/11/23, 6:36 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

06/11/23, 6:36 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Tinevimbo with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
06/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you for the given facts. The concept of rewards motivates people to work hard. In Zimbabwe, school offering rewards to there students and staff often produce wonderful results.
06/11/23, 6:44 pm - Kunal: Indeed Mr Christopher
06/11/23, 6:44 pm - Kunal: You can address this
06/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 772 5401: I am committed to funding my son Tinevimbo 's remaining fees. By the time my son enroll for UNIVERSITY his sister would have completed her Program. I have side hustles to augment my salary.
06/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
06/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 772 5401: That would be a dream come true. He is eager to access quality education. With the information gathered, that would be wonderful.
07/11/23, 6:35 am - Kunal: Let us connect at *11:30 am CAT Today to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
07/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Good afternoon sir. I am fine and ready to continue our discussions. I promised to fund additional fees for my son. I would like to know how beneficiaries can get 100 percent assistance.
07/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at even a greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
07/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
07/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you for the guidance. Would you please give me the timelines for the submission of the application letter. How do i get the application form?
07/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that you do not have to submit them now
07/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
07/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
07/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 2:19 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
07/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you for the update. So do i have to wait for the Advanced  Level results first. The enrollment fee is affordable. I have to save money in time to meet deadlines. Thank you for considering the plight of the less privileged. I am pleased to note that the program is flexible enough to leave no one behind. As a parent, i feel it is the right time to plan ahead. This is good news to me.
07/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
07/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

07/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 772 5401: We are having erratic network signals. Above is my last communication. I really appreciate the flexibility of the program that leaves no one behind. To me it is the right time to make preparations in time. Thank you for the information.
07/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: I understand, let me tell you that the enrollment fee is not needed now as it will be needed if the student is found eligible for the program
07/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: Since we are at last part of our session, I would appreciate if you can address this and finish it by today
07/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 772 5401: From the discussions held so far we have already covered the six stages. I now have a clear picture of the requirements and procedures involved.
07/11/23, 3:15 pm - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
07/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Thanks. You can go ahead. I am listening.
07/11/23, 3:20 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
07/11/23, 3:20 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process.

08/11/23, 1:09 pm - Austin: Greetings Mr Christopher, Mrs Leticia and Tinevimbo,

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*
Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Mr Kunal and learned about the program better. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
08/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Good afternoon sir. We had a great session. I hope to do the same with you. I am ready . You can go ahead.
08/11/23, 1:38 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today,Mr Christopher

I hope you are doing well
08/11/23, 1:38 pm - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
08/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 772 5401: I have realized that the program is wonderful. The conditions are favourable and flexible enough. As a parent i am ready to assist my son in every way possible. My wish is to see my son getting access to quality education and becoming marketable after completion of the program. My question is,under which conditions do beneficiaries enjoy a 100 percent assistance?
08/11/23, 2:07 pm - Austin: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
08/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you. Would you please highlight the requirements and procedures involved in the Eligibility check stage. What are the Advanced Level entry points? What other requirements are considered?
08/11/23, 2:29 pm - Austin: Edoofa scholarship Program offerers 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment. The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

The final percentage will be mentioned in the Offer Letter from the University
08/11/23, 2:30 pm - Austin: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about your child achieving it
08/11/23, 2:31 pm - Austin: We evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the A level students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.
08/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you for giving me some direction. It is interesting to note that beneficiaries are encouraged to score higher grades. Since our wish is to see our son realising his lifetime dream of accessing quality education,we are encouraging him to work hard. Rewarding hard work is an incentive. I strongly believe that Tinevimbo would attain higher scores since he is goal oriented and hard working. I will provide supportive resources to promote serious learning.
09/11/23, 6:40 am - Austin: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 9:52 am - Austin: Good Morning to you all!
How are you today?
09/11/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 772 5401: Morning sir. I am fine. We can proceed. I am ready.
09/11/23, 10:08 am - Austin: Good to hear that, Mr Christopher!
09/11/23, 10:08 am - Austin: It's wonderful to hear about your commitment to supporting Tinevimbo in achieving his academic goals. Hard work and dedication indeed go hand in hand with success. By providing supportive resources and fostering a conducive learning environment, you're setting the stage for Tinevimbo to excel in his studies.
09/11/23, 10:09 am - Austin: Are you having other questions for me regarding the Edoofa program as of now?
09/11/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you for the information. My question is on extracurriculars? Would you please shed light on activities involved that are considered.
09/11/23, 10:49 am - Austin: You are welcome!
Extracurriculars are activities or pursuits outside of the regular academic curriculum. These can include sports, clubs, community service, arts, or any organized activity that students participate in to enhance their skills, interests, and overall personal development.
09/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you for clarification. My son Tinevimbo is a talented soccer player. I would encourage him to take everything seriously.
09/11/23, 12:50 pm - Austin: You are welcome and that would be an advantage for him!
09/11/23, 12:50 pm - Austin: What else would you like to ask me please?

11/11/23, 4:59 am - +263 77 772 5401: Morning sir. We are having poor network signal. Our previous discussion was on eligibility check process. Do you have any discussion sessions today?
13/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Good afternoon sir. I am having challenges in getting through.
13/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Good afternoon sir.  I am experiencing network challenges. Can we proceed with the discussion? I am ready.
14/11/23, 6:13 am - +263 77 772 5401: Morning. I am having challenges in getting through. How can i reconnect with you on this platform?
14/11/23, 6:18 am - Austin: Good Morning Mr Christopher!
14/11/23, 6:24 am - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you for the response. I was worried by loss of connection. I wanted to inform you that i am ready to continue our discussion today at the usual time.
14/11/23, 6:27 am - Austin: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 6:29 am - +263 77 772 5401: Thank you sir.  Good day.
14/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 772 5401: It is interesting to get the information right from a beneficiary. I am convinced that everything under discussion is real. My prayer is to have my son enrolled so as to realize his dream. I have discovered that hard work rewards. I strongly believe that Tinevimbo has all the qualities required for enrollment into the program.
14/11/23, 9:32 am - Austin: Good to hear from you, Mr Christopher!
14/11/23, 9:37 am - Austin: I am glad to hear that and I appreciate your vision to see your child achieving the best through the Edoofa program
14/11/23, 9:38 am - Austin: As you know, A level students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Tinevimbo?*
14/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 772 5401: Thanks for the correspondence. I am ready to take up the sat Reservation Interview call on behalf of my son Tinevimbo.
14/11/23, 10:55 am - Austin: I appreciate your willingness, Mr Christopher!
14/11/23, 10:56 am - Austin: Can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will he be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
14/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 772 5401: Tinevimbo is willing to study B.Com (Management, Accounting and International Finance) or BSc Computer Science.
His desire is to study in India.
According to given literature,the average cost of study in India without a scholarship averages between US$1500 to US$2300.
Your explanation is clear.
14/11/23, 12:37 pm - Austin: Did Tinevimbo choose between BCom and BSc Computer Science?
14/11/23, 12:37 pm - Austin: 3)The average cost of education in India is $6000-$8000

4)The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on the child's performance in academics, he can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living <This message was edited>
14/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 772 5401: His choice is B.Com. My discussion with Mr Kunal gave me a better understanding of the program. I am yet to discuss with him. However he is studying commercial sciences at Advanced Level.
14/11/23, 12:42 pm - Austin: This is well noted, Mr Christopher!
