*I am Mr Austin, Career Counselor at Edoofa and with us, we have Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions and Mr Kunal, Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program.

Due to the overwhelming response from applicants, we wanted to ensure you receive personalized attention. Therefore, we've scheduled a dedicated time slot just for you:

📅 *Date: 12th December 2023*
🕤 *Time: 11:30 AM CAT*

Please mark the time to ensure you're available for this important counseling session as your active participation is an important parameter for evaluation. To prepare for our session, we encourage you to explore our website at [www.edoofa.com], the video and document shared along. This will provide you with valuable insights into our programs and opportunities. In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. <This message was edited>

With a positive note, I am here to resume the session
Shall we proceed?

12/12/23, 12:08 pm - Kunal: It is a pleasure to connect with you
How are you?

12/12/23, 12:11 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
12/12/23, 12:11 pm - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*


In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
