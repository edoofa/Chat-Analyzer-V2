I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
12/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 051 6691: Yes

12/12/23, 6:10 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
12/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 051 6691: Yeah it's true l'm intrigued and India is rich with history and growing in educational sector.However studying in India makes a student feel special and inspired.
12/12/23, 6:20 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
12/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 051 6691: No
12/12/23, 6:21 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 6:21 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 6:22 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
12/12/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 051 6691: If the cost is reduced to $3000 what about accomodation , food and basic university expense
12/12/23, 6:28 pm - Kunal: To understand it better, the reduced cost of education($2000-$3000)per annum includes the remaining tuition fee, food, accommodation and basic necessities such as Wifi,Laundry,Library fee etc.
12/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 051 6691: If l am on a 50% how much would l be paying
12/12/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 051 6691: I mean 50% scholarship
12/12/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 051 6691: And what if I am on a 100% scholarship how much money l will be paying
12/12/23, 7:47 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:18 am - +263 78 051 6691: Okay will resume tomorrow
