I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 651 3059: Yes, I am
12/12/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
So, may I know with your interest in Medical field, why didn't you opt Physics at A level?
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 651 3059: Because in biology I could learn more about the human body rather than in physics. I also like reading so, biology kept a balance on my combination. Instead of just learning applications, reading and understanding was also important to me
12/12/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: Alright Zanele
Let me tell you, since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
12/12/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: Since you are not having Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest and passion in the field there are courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help you fulfil your dreams of working in this field
