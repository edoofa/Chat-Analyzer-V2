08/11/23, 4:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 4:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.

27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:54 pm - +91 97793 29690: Yes
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - +91 97793 29690: Yes ma’am
27/11/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - +91 97793 29690: Yes l am ready
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that Faith would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 97793 29690: That is great
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - +91 97793 29690: Yess ma’am
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:11 pm - +91 97793 29690: It’s a good target but l doubt I’ll be able to meet it in December l have my final exams and the pressure of covering everything
27/11/23, 3:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure Faith that you will be able to spare some time for your sessions and weekend time for working on projects.
27/11/23, 3:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
27/11/23, 3:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 3:19 pm - +91 97793 29690: Yes
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - +91 97793 29690: I think we can achieve it if we continue with the way we were doing to have calls on Saturdays or Wednesdays
27/11/23, 3:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great and also, getting our gears run for the $300 plan. Right?
27/11/23, 3:27 pm - +91 97793 29690: Yess ma’am
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will continue our discussion tomorrow from 06:00 - 07:00 PM, please make sure you come on time for the session.
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - +91 97793 29690: Okay

28/11/23, 4:12 pm - +91 97793 29690: I haven’t organised any strategy as of yet but l think if l target the students who finished they’re a level this year l might get students
28/11/23, 4:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You can target the students who are expected to come next year and even in 2025, the range of students have increased exponentially that you can reach out to.
28/11/23, 4:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I just want you to know that there is no limit on the credits you can earn, simply sky is the limit. Have a look at these students who are pushing all the limits and breaking the boundaries👇🏼

30/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 97793 29690: I will try my best because l don’t have much of a large audience so it’s difficult

30/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 97793 29690: Yes
30/11/23, 3:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Faith, coming to all our recent developments, guess what? While I was scrolling through LinkedIn yesterday, I stumbled upon one of our rockstar students proudly flaunting his recent certification, and the response was mind-blowing! 🌟
30/11/23, 3:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, let's talk about you – have you ever crossed paths with the superhero of the professional world, LinkedIn?
30/11/23, 3:43 pm - +91 97793 29690: I understood that inputs are the block of any task and that by understanding your inputs you’re on the right track of your tasks.l also understood that after understanding the inputs you set up your plan and by doing so you’re set for the future.l comprehended that output is the result of your efforts or inputs.If things dont go as planned you check out your mistakes and rectify them
30/11/23, 3:43 pm - +91 97793 29690: No
30/11/23, 4:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you for your thoughtful summary of the key components in tackling tasks effectively. Recognizing the significance of understanding inputs as the foundation for any endeavor demonstrates a keen awareness of the essential starting point. Formulating a well-thought-out plan based on this understanding not only provides direction but also lays the groundwork for future success. The acknowledgment that output is the tangible result of one's efforts underscores the importance of execution and follow-through. Furthermore, your insight into the adaptive process of identifying and rectifying mistakes when things deviate from the plan highlights a crucial aspect of continuous improvement
30/11/23, 4:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Coming to this Faith, having a LinkedIn profile is like having a golden ticket in the professional world. It's your online resume, introducing you to potential employers and collaborators. Firstly, it showcases your experience, skills, and education, acting as a digital snapshot of your career. Secondly, it connects you with a vast network of professionals, opening doors to opportunities you might not discover elsewhere. Thirdly, it's a hub for industry insights and trends, keeping you in the loop. Moreover, it's a platform for recommendations, adding credibility to your profile. Lastly, job opportunities often pop up directly on your feed, making job hunting a breeze. In essence, LinkedIn is your personal brand's best friend, helping you shine in the professional arena. 🌐🌟
30/11/23, 4:00 pm - +91 97793 29690: Thank you
30/11/23, 4:01 pm - +91 97793 29690: Noted
30/11/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For a stellar LinkedIn profile as a first-year college student, start with a professional photo and a catchy headline that showcases your aspirations. Craft a compelling summary introducing yourself and your goals. Highlight your academic achievements and relevant coursework. Add any part-time jobs, internships, or volunteer experiences to showcase your skills. Connect with classmates, professors, and professionals in your field. Endorsements from peers can add credibility. Lastly, share posts or articles related to your interests to show engagement. Keep it polished, and you're ready to make a strong professional impression! 🌟📚

30/11/23, 4:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So concluding the session with some awesome news! As I had a conversation with Mr. Anik the Career Development Officer and Ms. Sanjana, the Head of the department, guess what? We're gearing up for an exciting industrial visit backed by Edoofa! In this opportunity you will be able to grasp live and practical knowledge of so many revolutionary things happening around us.🎉
But one thing that I want to share with you personally, something that really made me think hard is that since there will be a lot of students that we have to choose from for this one-in-a-lifetime opportunity and experience, will you be able to fall in that top student's category?
30/11/23, 4:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 🤔Do ponder upon it and honestly evaluate that should you be eligible for it,  have you been consistent throughout?
30/11/23, 4:29 pm - +91 97793 29690: That’s great
02/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, my Proud Edoofian!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.
