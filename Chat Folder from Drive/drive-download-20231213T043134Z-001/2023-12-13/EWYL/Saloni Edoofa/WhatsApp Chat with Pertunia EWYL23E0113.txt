In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.

I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_.

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

12/10/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
12/10/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
12/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 272 8530: Thank you very much i do understand and its clear.

01/12/23, 9:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you please share about the same?
01/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 494 2197: So as a career oriented person, I understood that the EWYL program is just the right program for me , equipping me with skills that will be required for jobs in future and giving me an insight of how to handle jobs in the future.It is not only a scholarship credit earnings program but also a program that promotes skills such as Networking, business development, decision making, only to mention a few.
One of the projects included in the EWYL is Corporate Alliance . In this program Edoofians research on certain co-operatives in their societies , reach out to them and create professional associates for Edoofa . One of the major tools to be used is LinkedIn. The other project is Community Building whereby Edoofians are to expand the community by looking into zealous young people who share the same interest in terms of Education and getting them to join Edoofa, fill out applications and be part of the big family.
01/12/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing Pertunia, I am extremely happy with your understanding and I believe that you have explained everything with superb clarity🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
01/12/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
01/12/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 494 2197: I have listened to the audio
01/12/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
01/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 494 2197: Cooperate alliance better equips for the future jobs which one might wish to undertake. Edoofians Connect with advanced companies in terms of technology and learn more about those companies, including their employees.

01/12/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Pertunia. I’m happy with your understanding.
01/12/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
01/12/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 494 2197: So the document simply caters for the characteristics of the companies that Edoofa seeks to interact with. The companies must either be student centered, recreational or content centered.  The employee size of the company is also an important aspect, it should be no less than 50 and no more than 200. The companies must be financially stable  and a detailed research on the background of the founder should be done.   In order to achieve all this platforms like Google, LinkedIn and social media platforms may be used. The document also provides details steps on how to aim at the companies we seek to interact with
01/12/23, 10:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 09:00-10:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there!

04/12/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Pertunia, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
04/12/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

How did you get in touch with the contact person?
04/12/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*

04/12/23, 9:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any questions about this, Pertunia? I can help you.
04/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 494 2197: No not at the moment but if I have any I will ask
04/12/23, 9:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright, Pertunia
04/12/23, 9:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Pertunia, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Pertunia!
04/12/23, 9:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 494 2197: Okay

04/12/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 494 2197: Done
04/12/23, 9:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you have learned from the audio?
04/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 494 2197: This project is a way of establishing connections worldwide and growing the Edoofa family covering a whole lot of Africans.Edoofians are expected to reach out to other students who have recently finished their senior secondary education or currently in their Senior year and refer them to Edoofa. This requires persuasion and socks networking skills that will be an advantage in future jobs. In so doing one also earns scholarship credits
04/12/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Pertunia, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
04/12/23, 9:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

04/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 494 2197: Yes understood
04/12/23, 9:58 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
04/12/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Pertunia/Saloni/4DEC2023*
04/12/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
04/12/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
04/12/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
04/12/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
04/12/23, 10:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 09:00-10:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
04/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 494 2197: See you
05/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 494 2197: Good morning
05/12/23, 9:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay in my response. I am currently engrossed in a meeting that demands my immediate attention. I kindly request an additional 15 minutes to conclude the discussion. I assure you that I will reach out to you promptly at 09:30 AM.

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your patience.
05/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 494 2197: Okay
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, let's begin now🚀

Thank you for your corporation!
05/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 494 2197: Yes we may begin
05/12/23, 9:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: Did you form the group as discussed yesterday?
05/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 494 2197: No I'm sorry I haven't formed the group, I haven't found candidatea yet
05/12/23, 9:40 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what challenges were you facing?
05/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 494 2197: Most students get their tuition from parents so they would want to go through their parents first before being added to any groups
05/12/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: But did you try to circulate the group link in your class groups?
05/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 494 2197: No i haven't done that because I hadn't created the group yet and we don't have any class groups


But I will get to it after this
05/12/23, 9:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, but I would like to enquire how would you do it?
05/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 494 2197: I will approach those that I was learning with individually
05/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 494 2197: Should I also add you to the group
05/12/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, add me in the group as well.
05/12/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
05/12/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
05/12/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

07/12/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 494 2197: Yes I understand
07/12/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Moving forward, now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far.

So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
07/12/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Students are then required to organise an online meeting with Edoofa and the principal of the school if they are interested.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
07/12/23, 9:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.
