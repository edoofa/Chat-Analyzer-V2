10/08/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Greetings ma'am
10/08/23, 1:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing?

May we begin with our sessions🌈
10/08/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Um good how are you too?
10/08/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
10/08/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: On Tuesday, I shared this amazing newsletter. May I know what all you grasped from it?
10/08/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am lemme summarise what l grasped
10/08/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have summarised it?
10/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 694 6404: I got to learn that life success isn't always a one man's show but actually it's something that calls for teamwork .Also l got to learn that taking small steps towards a goal rather than big goals can lead to reduced feelings of overwhelm.Breaking down a big goal into smaller steps make it easier to manage and reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed .It also increases motivation as achieving small successes along the way provides a sense of accomplishments and increases motivation to continue working towards the larger goal.Lastly, consistently taking small steps helps to build momentum and leads to consistent progress towards the desires outcome
10/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Um sorry my network is tripping ma'am
10/08/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your realization of the significance of teamwork in life's success is truly remarkable. Embracing collaboration not only enriches our journey but also brings diverse strengths together.

Your grasp of the power of small steps is equally impressive. Breaking down monumental goals into manageable tasks is a profound strategy. Your recognition that these smaller victories ignite motivation and momentum resonates deeply.
10/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Thank u ma'am😊
10/08/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
10/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am hope u had a great day
11/08/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing?

May we begin with our sessions🌈
11/08/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Um doing good ma'am 
How are you too?
11/08/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Yes lets begin
11/08/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
11/08/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Anodiwa- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
11/08/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am
11/08/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Anodiwa, I am waiting for your understanding.

Please don't worry if you are right or wrong, what matters to me is your engagement and slight bit of understanding.
11/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 694 6404: In that document some of the skills that l will have to acquire are relationship building, networking, business development, decision making, risk taking and empathy.So during my EWYL program my first task is that l will have to identify organizations and their decision makers and reach out to them to share all about Edoofa.After that l will have to arrange a  call between them (the organization) and Edoofa.
My second task is that l will have to find a list of youths who are close  and these youths must be at A level or were there in the last six months, so that they can fill the application for the Edoofa program....so for the students that will enrol in the Edoofa program and pays the first part of the enrollment fee l will be getting $20 worth of scholarship credit .Lastly l will have to reach to local schools in my area and speak with the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa.
11/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your dedication and strategic approach to your EWYL tasks are truly commendable. You're not just acquiring essential skills like relationship building and business development, but you're actively implementing them to make a positive impact. Your commitment to connecting organizations, students, and local schools showcases your initiative and drive. Your efforts are inspiring, and your actions reflect your determination to make a difference.
11/08/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
11/08/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 694 6404: I have listened to the audio and it really made it clear on what l will have to do on my first task

Vibrant parades, flag-hoisting ceremonies, cultural performances, and patriotic fervor color the celebrations across the country. It's a time to reflect on India's journey to self-governance and to honor the leaders who led the struggle for freedom.

16/08/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 694 6404: The first project is corporate alliance so in that project the objectives include gaining an understanding of the market that l plan to enter in the future so l must start preparing for it at an early stage.My first  task is to identify companies within my country or region and share to them the objectives and explain how Edoofa is helping in bringing the necessary skills for future employability after graduating ....should also create a Lindel account which is a professional networking platform as it will help me reach out to managers so that l can get information to set up a meeting with Edoofa...creating a lindel account will expand my professional network enhancing my credibility and increases my chance of security internships and gaining industrial exposure.
16/08/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Anodiwa. I’m happy with your understanding.
16/08/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details.

16/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 694 6404: My task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa and will be willing to expand their help in the overall development of all the students that enroll for the Edoofa scholarship programe...so to make sure that l look for the right type of the companies, l should look at the following factors which includes 
i) The nature of the company
ii) The scale of the company
iii)The Financial stability of the company

Also the platform that l can use are google,linkedln or even the social media pages such as facebook, Instagram and twitter

2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
22/08/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Owkay ma'am
22/08/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
22/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Anodiwa/Saloni/22AUG2023*
22/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
22/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
22/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
22/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Amazing
22/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 694 6404: So do l need to add you to this groups ma'am
23/08/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
Please excuse me for the delay, got occupied in an urgent call.
23/08/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Um doing good ma'am 
How are you too?
Yes lets begin
23/08/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
23/08/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes you need to add me in the groups.
23/08/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Have you formed the group?
23/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 694 6404: That's great
23/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Not yet
23/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Okay ma'am will do so <This message was edited>

23/08/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know when will you form the group?
23/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Not sure ma'am ..will try to create it as soon as possible and  inform u
23/08/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure that will be great!
23/08/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
23/08/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

06/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 78 211 5564: Hope. I find you well Ma'am Saloni. Anodiwa is sitting her final Upper Six examinations this term starting in October 2023. You may get in touch with her on her free time,  particularly Saturdays and Sundays. Certainly I cannot promise successful sessions during weekdays Monday to Friday. Where we can please let us know if we can be of help. We want her to pass both her final examinations plus accomplish these sessions extensively. Thank you for understanding and including us in mapping Anodiwa's road map to stardom.
07/09/23, 12:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello there!
I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸
07/09/23, 12:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note that our session will be held tomorrow at our respective times.

How are you?
08/09/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
08/09/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.

15/09/23, 4:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Monday and Thursday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

18/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 71 291 4917: Thank you Ma'am Saloni.  I understand all the points you highlighted above. Am sorry I couldn't be with you on time today. Anodiwa's mother is not feeling well. I was on the highway driving a heavy vehicle and got caught up in a traffic jam. I hope to be with you on Thursday without fail. Warm regards.🙏🏼✍🏻✍🏻

25/09/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

28/09/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
28/09/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 291 4917: It is well ma'am Saloni. We are not yet through with funerals but we can proceed for the next 1hr
28/09/23, 1:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so sorry for everything.
I will only proceed if you permit.
28/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 291 4917: We can proceed.
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

How are you doing!

Since the organization was closed yesterday on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I would like to take the missed session on Wednesday, which is tomorrow from 09:30-11:00 AM.
04/10/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
04/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 71 291 4917: Good evening. Ma'am Saloni. We apologies for missing today's session. I was of the opinion that these sessions be suspended until ANODIWA is through with her examinations. I have realized that I'm almost always very busy throughout the week, day and night. If you check properly, there is very little that has been achieved, if any at all, through our sessions (Facilitator and Parents). My sincere apologies.
05/10/23, 12:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

I have noted that, we will keep the program on hold.
05/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 291 4917: Thank you Ma'am
16/10/23, 12:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂.

26/10/23, 6:16 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Hello ma'am 
How are doing
26/10/23, 6:17 pm - +263 71 694 6404: Wow, that's a very detailed and interesting explanation of Dussehra and its significance .  It's interesting to see how the festival has found resonance in Zimbabwe, despite not having an indigenous connection to the country. It's wonderful to see the intermingling of cultures and religions taking place through such festivals. I also find it interesting that Zimbabwe celebrates traditional festivals like the Chisi Festival, alongside religious celebrations like Christmas and Easter.
26/10/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 694 6404: There are a number of similarities between Zimbabwean and Indian culture. Both countries have a deep respect for their elders, a strong sense of family values, and a strong emphasis on hospitality and tradition. Additionally, the cuisines of  both countries have rich musical traditions, with Zimbabwean music often drawing on African rhythms while Indian music is influenced by ancient traditions and classical instruments like the sitar and tabla. It's fascinating to see the commonalities between the two countries' cultures, despite their geographical distance.
