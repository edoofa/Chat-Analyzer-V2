12/12/23, 9:10 am - +265 996 40 67 62: Well it was because I have a small piece work and the time I suggested was lunch time

12/12/23, 1:37 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: It’s a small piece work where I did my internship <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Sometimes they ask for my assistance when needed
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: But it’s not everyday
12/12/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This sounds fantastic Freda, can you shed more light on the role you were doing their and what was the name of the company?
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Central Poultry. I was doing my research paper there because it was focusing on a production company. A lady who is the head of quality assurance management asked me to apply for quality controller role which I did for three months
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: By then I had not yet graduated
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: It was quite challenging but I enjoyed working with them because I learnt a lot
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing, Freda!

I am so impressed listening to that, I can't even express🫶🏻🚀
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
12/12/23, 1:57 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much. I appreciate it
12/12/23, 1:58 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I’m looking to everything as well
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great Freda!
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Freda, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/12/23, 2:22 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok. Long term goals I like to visualize myself at a managerial role or position which requires a lot skills, knowledge and experience. I plan on doing this by facing challenges or tasks head on. I love reading managerial books as well as observing current leaders and how the perform even in their decision making skills.
I believe that EWYL will help me because every skill or knowledge we acquire is also beneficial and not only will I be earning credit scores but most importantly grabbing knowledge that will also be handy
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, Freda and I assure you that I am always there with you in this journey🫶🏻🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
12/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾
