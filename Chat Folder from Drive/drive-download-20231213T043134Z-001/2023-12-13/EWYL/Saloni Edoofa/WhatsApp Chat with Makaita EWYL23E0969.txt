Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
04/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I hope that it will be

05/12/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
05/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 294 9349: Good afternoon
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes please
05/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Good and you
05/12/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you!
05/12/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Makaita, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
05/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I want to attain a masters and EWYL program will assist in that because it reduces the burden of paying fees on my parents.
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great because I am there with you on this journey and I will make sure you achieve these goals.
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 245 5997: Good afternoon. Iam Rabson Mudavanhu, Makaita's father.
05/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Can you explain them please
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello sir, how are you doing?
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
05/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I understand
05/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 245 5997: I am very well, thank you and how are you?
05/12/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
05/12/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
05/12/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I read it
05/12/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from it?
05/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 871 0042: With your assistance,he was able to maximize his gain from the EWYL program and he also acquired skills along the way
05/12/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, I am sure you will be able to score more and really high!
05/12/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
05/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I hope so because I need to
05/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Nice to know them
05/12/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
05/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Ok ma'am ,enjoy the rest of your day
05/12/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You too, Makaita
06/12/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
06/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Afternoon ma'am,I'm good and you ... Yes,we can start
06/12/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
06/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Welcome
06/12/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
06/12/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I'm glad to know you ma'am and happy that we share a similar passion in  art
06/12/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
06/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes I did
06/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
06/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
06/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes,can't wait. Anxious about what will be me first task.... It's intriguing actually.
06/12/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome!
06/12/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
06/12/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I'm done ma'am
06/12/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
06/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I love the first quote because it's similar to what my grandmother used to tell me..."Just because it didn't work, doesn't mean it's the wrong choice. The world is full of probabilities,not certainties....."
06/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you could resemble the same and yes, it is just one of the hundreds of newsletters. You will soon receive a lot in the coming future🌟
06/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I will be impatiently waiting
06/12/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
06/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Loved the chat and enjoy your day ma'am

11/12/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You don't have to share yours. You have to find prospective students who are willing to be a part of Edoofa family and then get this form filled from them.

Yes,we can
12/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I'm following
12/12/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
12/12/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Makaita/Saloni/12DEC2023*
12/12/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
12/12/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
12/12/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
12/12/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
12/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 871 0042: That's awesome but can I start the group and recruitment of potential Edoofians today
12/12/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, of course, you can begin from today onwards.
12/12/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/12/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
12/12/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
