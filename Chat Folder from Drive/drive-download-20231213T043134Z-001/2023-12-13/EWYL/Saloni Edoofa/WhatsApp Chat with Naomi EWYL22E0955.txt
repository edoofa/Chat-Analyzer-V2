I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Saloni your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Saloni's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

20/11/23, 3:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Naomi,
I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Tuesday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for tomorrow's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the EWYL Group starting tomorrow. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it removes the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting tomorrow, our sessions will be held from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, Monday to Friday, on the EWYL Group. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!

 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
29/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 407 8479: Well understood
29/11/23, 10:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
29/11/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Naomi/Saloni/29NOV2023*
29/11/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/11/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
29/11/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
29/11/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
29/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 71 407 8479: My father is not happy anymore about my journey with Edoofa. Because there things he feels he has lost trust about.
29/11/23, 10:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: What happened Naomi, tell me freely?
29/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 407 8479: Kindly reach out to him
29/11/23, 11:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what is his concern?
29/11/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 407 8479: He had a payment plan as follows; 
1. $120 by the 28th of October which he did.
2. $280 by the 30th of November 
And 3. $300 by the 23 December. And he had sent an email of the above to academicboard@edoofa.com explaining this agreement he had done with Mr Milan. But he was told he needs to pay $512 by yesterday 28 November.
29/11/23, 11:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you shared this concern with the admission team?
29/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 407 8479: Yes
30/11/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Naomi,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
30/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 407 8479: Good morning
30/11/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Did they respond to you?
30/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 407 8479: They are communicating at the moment
30/11/23, 11:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure you will have positive feedback and their response will be justifiable.
01/12/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Naomi,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
01/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 407 8479: Morning
01/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 407 8479: Yes
01/12/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you got any response from them?
01/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 407 8479: It's a long discussion they're still sorting it out
01/12/23, 10:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Till that time, I hope we can continue with our session Naomi.
01/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 407 8479: Sure ma'am
01/12/23, 10:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Have you understood till this process?
01/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 407 8479: Yes I have
01/12/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Have you formed the group?
01/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 407 8479: Not yet doing so today
01/12/23, 10:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!
01/12/23, 10:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
01/12/23, 10:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
01/12/23, 10:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
01/12/23, 10:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

06/12/23, 10:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: Naomi, you were present for the session on Monday as well on Tuesday and in today's session, you turned up late. May I know the challenges, please?
06/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 71 407 8479: Like I told you before we face network challenges there's no solution to that if there's no network I can't go online I hope you understand that
06/12/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that electricity issues and connectivity gaps are not in our hands but I would suggest that you either try to inform us beforehand that there is a high possibility of an unstable connection during our session or use someone else device for connection sharing.
I hope you understand that the direct link to all these is on your session and growth that is our priority right.
06/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 407 8479: I think by now you have noticed I only reply when the network is available there's no way I can guess that today the network will work
06/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 71 407 8479: I do get what you are saying but then my parents and I stay in the same place meaning the network is the same there's no way it will be different
06/12/23, 10:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that, no worries!
06/12/23, 10:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
