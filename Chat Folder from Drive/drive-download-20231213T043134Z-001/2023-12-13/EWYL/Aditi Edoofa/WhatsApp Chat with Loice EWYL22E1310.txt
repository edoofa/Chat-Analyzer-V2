You have won the Grant challenge! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on [Date] at [Time] to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the grant letter for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

22/08/23, 11:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Loice, I'd want to bring up the fact that we've noticed your inconsistency in attending sessions. If this pattern persists, there's a possibility that your grant could be taken away. It would be advisable for you to improve your attendance record, be more proactive, and dedicate more effort to your projects.
And also you haven't shown up for the Grant Discussion Session and nor do I have your signed Grant Letter so in this case you grant can be revoked so it would be appreciated if you do the needful and be more active.
22/08/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 341 5728: Sorry Ma'am i was having network challenges because of power cuts, for the Grant discussion session we did it together on Wednesday 16 August and submitted my signed Grant Letter on Thursday.

Hope you are well.
23/08/23, 10:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls when you would be in India.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities. <This message was edited>

I hope you are doing well.
I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 10:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
