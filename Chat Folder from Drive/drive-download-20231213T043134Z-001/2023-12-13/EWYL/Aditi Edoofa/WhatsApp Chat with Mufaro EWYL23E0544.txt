09/10/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Mufaro!
Hope you are well.
09/10/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Mufaro, the way you engaged with them served a different objective, and it was effective. However, I'd like to emphasize the significance of the EWYL journey. It's primarily focused on enhancing your skills, and it should involve an ongoing, two-way conversation. It's not just about delivering information to you; it's equally important for you to actively engage and participate. I'll ensure that your learning is a priority in this process.
09/10/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good morning! It's nice to meet you, ma'am. I appreciate you joining the group and your interest in contributing to Mufaro's EWYL sessions. I understand that network challenges can be a concern in rural areas, but your support is valuable.
09/10/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you very much. Good morning.
09/10/23, 9:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: Mufaro, I would like to know which timing suits you better either the morning batch i.e. 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM or the afternoon batch i.e. 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM?

So I hope you are ready to commence the session.🚀
09/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Am ready
09/10/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
09/10/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
09/10/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We didn't get to some key discussions; please participate actively as I trust you recognize how valuable the EWYL session is.
09/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 754 4092: I think the two key objectives of EWYW are 1.to earn scholarship credits.                    2. to assist in reducing my University fees
09/10/23, 3:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
09/10/23, 3:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
09/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Learning becomes more useful and beneficial if it comes from doing and involving. EWYL focuses on preparing me for the real world. Through the EWYL program, l will earn scholarship credits in the process. Secondly the EWYL program will reduce the burden of the cost of my education.
09/10/23, 4:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Mufaro, the fact that my messages are delivered to you on time which I duly checked today indicates that the network problem is manageable. However, it's your limited responsiveness that seems to be the issue.
09/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you very much for enlightening me more on EWYL
09/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good night
09/10/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you for your observations. It also looks to me that network here seems accessible from around 1500 hours onwards.
10/10/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
10/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good afternoon. Yes I am ready.
10/10/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
10/10/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
10/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you very much.
10/10/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
10/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes it's interesting.
10/10/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
10/10/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 754 4092: I have managed to read through the first Newsletter. Can I proceed to the second one or not?
10/10/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, Mufaro! 
Now may go through the other one after this session, I would like to move further with the session.
10/10/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
10/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 754 4092: I have read both newsletters. Edoofian Hall of lnspiration , is indeed inspirational.
10/10/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
10/10/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Mufaro?
10/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 754 4092: This sounds great indeed.
10/10/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
10/10/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session and I'm looking forward to our next session.
10/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 754 4092: My introduction to my EWYL is that we have Ms Sanjana Head of the Department and Ms Davi who is the Head Coach. Both will ensure that achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL program.            2.The goals my mentor has set are that (a)to ensure that my academic journey is great.                (b) my mentor has also set as a goal that I am given enough opportunities to self-finance my higher education in lndia and thirdly that I work towards attaining the objective that I learn and evolve with you relevant 21st century skills to prepare me for the real world workplace and help me grow holistically.               Hall of lnspiration... What I understood about this term is that school life is not all about academics, sports, friends and fun but of being aware of the social issues, inequities and make amends of the deformities on society. Age is not a hindrance to start community service eg helps the elderly, the disabled etc in society. Nkosilomusa Jecheche learnt leadership skills like making decisions while young and managed to lead organisations. This is an inspiration to me.
10/10/23, 4:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, we will connect on this in tomorrow's session.
10/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you.
10/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you.
11/10/23, 2:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Mufaro!
How are you?

So, are you prepared for today's session?
11/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes please
11/10/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
11/10/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. I'm reading it now
11/10/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay! After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
11/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good afternoon. I have managed to go through the passage. What I have now learnt vividly is that the program EWYL is instrumental in providing higher education which is accessible, affordable and makes me employable.            I have also learned that EWYL has some aspects that an Edoofian has to understand. These are... Awareness. This means keeping updated about events or things that are happening. These events can be positive or negative and equally affect affect us either way. As an Edoofian, l should be well informed about different events in the world that will have a bearing on my career paths. In a nutshell, Awareness means to be aware of how businesses are changing and learning with times.                     Acquisition of Skills. I need to know or understand the skills that I should acquire to reach my career goals although some expire over time. There are skills that emerge like meetings were replaced by zoom calls or video calls. Then Social media became prevalent following COVID pandemic.              I also learned that there are emerging skills like digital skills, online skills and literacy. I should be resourceful online to get right information.      Social media literacy. Businesses now and in future will rely on attracting, retaining and engaging customers on media platforms.              I also learned that there is Creative writing. Businesses have become digital and are going to be driven by creative and online communication. It means I should be a professional who can writing strong narratives which will be in high demand in the industry.         Another skill l learned is that of Data analysis which is the ability to spot the right opportunities.           There's remote team-work which is the ability to coordinate with my team members in different geographical setups.                    I also learned that there are skills that always will be there. These are called Enduring skills. These need a high degree of creativity, emotional intelligence and strategic thinking.           I also learned about Projects. There guidelines l should follow like identifying local organisations or companies in the region abroad 2.k should identify the decision makers in these companies. 3.l should read out  and share with them Edoofian vision and mission. 4.I should also arrange for a call or video call and lastly I should facilitate the signing of contacts.             I also learned that there are activities as an Edoofian l should do eg. Find clients 2.deal i payment systems 3.have community mobile platforms 4.identify educational technology companies. I will make a list of them in an execel.                    Roughly this is what I understood. Good day
12/10/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Mornin Mufaro!

12/10/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
12/10/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
12/10/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you for the audio call. What I have understood from the call is that l should identify local organisations or companies in my country or in the region. I should identify decision makers in these companies and then reach out to these individuals and explain to them Edoofa's vision, mission and how Edoofa is helping me to achieve the skills after graduation. I also need to arrange for a call or video call meeting between Edoofa and these organisations. Finally l should facilitate the signing of the contracts. This is what I understood from the audio call.

19/10/23, 3:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Mufaro, may I know why didn't you attend today's session?
19/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good afternoon. I'm ready. It's because of network. I'm sorry for the delay.
19/10/23, 4:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Mufaro, please try to be on time for your session tomorrow
19/10/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Honestly I promise you that I will be on time. However, do you still need more applicants for the Edoofa program? Network here is a problem.
20/10/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
Hope you are well.

I understand Mufaro.
20/10/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: We will discuss this in our session.
20/10/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 754 4092: Good morning. Thank you.
20/10/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Are you ready for today's session?
20/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes
20/10/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
20/10/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
20/10/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
20/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 754 4092: null
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

20/10/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. There were some crucial discussions we couldn't cover; I encourage your active participation and respond timely because I believe you understand the significance of the EWYL session.
20/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you.
20/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Point 3 which students do you mean?
20/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. I identified some students whom I sent on the platform. Are they the ones l should use for this project. Again should I add more?
20/10/23, 4:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, sure you may!
20/10/23, 4:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Mufaro, are you asking about this point?
20/10/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Thank you. I'm now contacting them.
23/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 754 4092: Good morning. What I understood in the message is that l should create a Group to include recrutees for the Edoofa program. Importantly I should include you Ms Kapoor as our Mentor.           Secondly, I have to explain to the new members what benefits Edoofa has for them, namely... 1.Edoofa makes education affordable. Affordability of education is result of the innovation (EWYL) program. This is an innovation that helps the student to reduce his or her some University expenses
23/10/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 754 4092: I'm going to explain to them that Edoofa is educative in the sense that it produces employable 21st century students well equipped with the requisite skills and other competencies. Hence Edoofa is profitable to the student.             Thank you. I have identified some students in my community and am creating a Group that includes you as well . Can I go ahead?
30/10/23, 2:31 pm - +91 74284 45625: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

Due to some technical glitch on Ms. Aditi's device she will be conducting your session through this device.

So are you ready for your session?
30/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good afternoon . Yes we can start.
31/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good evening. Any more communication? Waiting for further information.
01/11/23, 7:28 am - +263 77 754 4092: Good morning. I hope you are doing well. We failed to communicate yesterday. I wanted to know if I can go ahead and form the Group of new recruits whom I had identified and had given me their details?
02/11/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Mufaro!
Hope you are well,

Please excuse me as due to technical issues we weren't able to communicate, but now it is resolved an I am here to assist you.
02/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Good afternoon. I'm glad to know that. Thank you.
02/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
02/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So shall we begin with our sesssion?
02/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 754 4092: Yes we can
02/11/23, 3:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
02/11/23, 3:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
02/11/23, 3:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
07/11/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
07/11/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

20/11/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It's okay.
20/11/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
20/11/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!

20/11/23, 3:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
20/11/23, 3:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
20/11/23, 3:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
20/11/23, 3:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, may I know if you are aware of these terms?
20/11/23, 3:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, this is it for today's session, we will meet tomorrow with renewed enthusiasm.🤩

23/11/23, 4:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay.
23/11/23, 4:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
23/11/23, 4:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
23/11/23, 4:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
23/11/23, 4:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Mufaro, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success.
