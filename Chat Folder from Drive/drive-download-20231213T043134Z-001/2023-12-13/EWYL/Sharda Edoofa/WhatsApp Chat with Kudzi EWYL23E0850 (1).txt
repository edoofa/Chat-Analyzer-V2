09/11/23, 12:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Kudzi, I am impressed with your understanding.
09/11/23, 12:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
09/11/23, 12:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -








Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same. 

After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.

09/11/23, 1:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
09/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 145 2450: 1).My school name is Holy Ghost College Marange, and it's not connected with Edoofa

2).Greetings to you the Headmaster, I'm Zimunya Kudzai, aged 20 and a selected student for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I'd love to share with you what drove me towards this Edoofa Scholarship Program and how it works and its benefits towards students who wish to study abroad especially in India.

3). Its located in Manicaland province here in Zimbabwe.
09/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
09/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Yes, I'm ready

09/11/23, 2:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Kudzi*, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.

09/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Yes, it is clear.
09/11/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
09/11/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
09/11/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
