I am looking forward to seeing you in the Webinar.
13/10/23, 12:54 pm - +91 81989 25360: Yes and please can l ask how much l have earned so far
13/10/23, 12:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Sure Tadiwanashe,
I checked about your scholarship credits. Since you did not not start working on the projects, you have not earned any scholarship credits.
13/10/23, 1:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: But do not worry at all, we will now start working projects together and will try to earn as many scholarship credits as we can.
13/10/23, 1:01 pm - +91 81989 25360: No that's not true l have earned some scholarship credits ask Mr Maurice
13/10/23, 1:01 pm - +91 81989 25360: Because as for now l have managed to recruit about 4 students other 2 are already in India
13/10/23, 1:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much letting me know about this.
Kindly excuse me for any confusion. Let me explain it clearly:

You have earned a total of $232 in scholarship credits. However, because you were discussing things with your admissions officers, you still need to pay your enrollment fee. So, we've used some of your scholarship credits to cover that fee.

Now, you have $82 in scholarship credits left that you can use by the end of the year when you need to pay for your college expenses. These credits will help reduce the amount you have to pay for college fees in the future.
13/10/23, 1:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Is everything clear now, Tadiwanashe?
13/10/23, 1:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I've got exciting news 🌟 - an opportunity perfectly aligned with your goals has come up. I immediately thought of you, and it could be a game-changer. 💯

It's a chance to earn more scholarship credits and open doors to incredible possibilities. 🚀

18/10/23, 8:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning, Tadiwanashe!

Please excuse me for the delay in getting back to you. I wanted to circle back on the last conversation that we had about your scholarship credits. 
So till date, you have earned a total of $232 worth of scholarship credits.

You earned $232 from the Community-building project. 
Out of the 4 students who enrolled in January 2023, 1 student in February 2023, and 1 student in September 2023. 2 students registered in March 2023 and the other student in April 2023.

As you had paid an enrollment fee of $200 out of $350, the remaining $150 was adjusted in your enrollment fees payment that was yet to be paid by you. Hence, we are now left with $82 that can be redeemed by you.
18/10/23, 9:13 am - +91 81989 25360: So l want to redeem $50 for the food is it necessary
18/10/23, 9:14 am - +91 81989 25360: But ma'am still the scholarship credits out of 4 students its less and you can even see it
18/10/23, 10:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, can you please elaborate on this?
18/10/23, 10:34 am - +91 81989 25360: Ok l am asking what is the credit for one student who have completed his enrollment and have come to India
20/10/23, 10:38 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Tadiwanashe

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

25/11/23, 3:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

I wanted to circle back on the recent conversation that we had about your scholarship credits. 
So, till date, you have earned a total of $233 worth of scholarship credits.
*You earned $233 from the Community-building project*.
*Enrolled Student*
4 students enrolled in January 2023
1 student enrolled in February 2023, 
1 student in September 2023. 

*Registered student*
1 student registered in March 2023         
1 student registered in April 2023.

As you had paid an enrollment fee of $200 out of $350, the remaining $150 was adjusted in your enrollment fees payment that was yet to be paid by you. *Hence, we are now left with $83 that can be redeemed by you.*

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!
