15/09/23, 9:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Sharon

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Sharon is now at school, cellphones are not allowed so she left it at home..
I the mom am going to attend the sessions, Mon, Tue, Wed  2-3pm. Pliz let's try and stick  to that time. 
Thank you
16/09/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Evening Ma'am
Hope you are doing well.
Noted well, thank you so much for your response.
20/09/23, 2:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings!
A wonderful day to you

I'm thrilled to welcome you to today's scheduled session

20/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Yes, now ready
20/09/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be *Sharon*'s mentor, guide, and a friend throughout the journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when Sharon is in India. 
Let me share something about myself through this video so that you can be rest assured that your child is in responsible hands …
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/09/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon 

Hope you are doing well!

It's a pleasure to have you join me for this scheduled session
Are you ready for an enriching learning experience ?
21/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 366 8176: M ready dear, how r u today
21/09/23, 2:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am doing great. Thank you.
21/09/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Not sure, remind me dear
21/09/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Sharon is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
21/09/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
21/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Understood, thanks for being patient
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
21/09/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome
21/09/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Waal, that's wonderful. EWYL is a good progm thanks team Edoofa
21/09/23, 3:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words
21/09/23, 3:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
21/09/23, 3:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
21/09/23, 3:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
21/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok, thanks my dear. Glad  to know Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi.
22/09/23, 2:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon 
I hope you are doing well

Are you available for today's session?
22/09/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Am sorry we had serious power cuts  since yesterday so mu fon battery was flat. Now available
23/09/23, 6:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Evening Sharon
I hope you are doing well

Excuse me for the delay in reply. I was not doing great healthwise.
Thank you so much for notifying. Make sure you are available in time from next time.
23/09/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok noted
25/09/23, 2:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Happy Monday*
I hope you are doing well

Are you ready for today's session?
25/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Yes ready, how are you my dear
25/09/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Sharon* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Interesting realy
25/09/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Sharon* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
25/09/23, 2:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Wonderful 👏👏👏
25/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok, Sharon is now at school can we wait for her to finish her exams, so that she will access the newsletter on her own. How r we going to go about it
25/09/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes yes for sure.
25/09/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I will have the basic discussion with you and then put sharon's program on Hold
25/09/23, 3:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Sharon*’S EWYL journey:
25/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok, thank you for your consideration
25/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok 👌

2. Ensure *Sharon* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
25/09/23, 3:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Sharon* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
25/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ok, waiting
25/09/23, 3:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: ince I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Sharon* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
25/09/23, 3:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency

3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Sharon* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
25/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Well noted

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

*Let's kick things off with a motivational quote from the legendary Warren Buffett:*
*"The best investment you can make is in yourself."*

This quote underscores the profound importance of self-development and personal growth. Buffett emphasizes that the most valuable asset you possess is yourself. By investing time, effort, and resources in your education, skills, and well-being, you lay the foundation for future success.

So, let's use today's session as an opportunity to explore how we can invest in ourselves, hone our skills, and empower each other on the journey towards success. Remember, the dividends of self-investment are boundless!
06/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 774 8216: Good afternoon Sharda

06/12/23, 2:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
06/12/23, 2:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: very quickly  summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
06/12/23, 2:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 774 8216: I have learned that I should identify the market I wish to venture into, then identify the companies in the market and understand their business by conducting meetings with the help of a LinkedIn account
06/12/23, 5:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You joined the session very late due to which we didn't get to some key discussions; please participate actively as I trust you recognize how valuable the EWYL session is.
Also, from next time be available in time without any delays.
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Keyhole 😊
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yo u are welcome please. The correct answer is a Keyboard.
07/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 774 8216: Hahaha
07/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 366 8176: 🤣👏👏👏
07/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 774 8216: Nice
07/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ah, that's a great answer, too! It fits the description perfectly. My answer was pretty literal, while yours is more metaphorical. I like it. You're quite the puzzle solver!

07/12/23, 2:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Amazing, thanks . I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you.

07/12/23, 2:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 2:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me

*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
07/12/23, 2:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Second and the fun part- I’m sure you have read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers :*$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa :*$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to 
the students of Edoofa in the future(proposal): *$10*
07/12/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.

We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies. 
To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms 
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
LinkedIn Profile Link:
07/12/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
07/12/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-*

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
07/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Noted thank yoi
07/12/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please.
07/12/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: PROJECT 2: COMMUNITY BUILDING
Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it.
07/12/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
07/12/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.* 
There were some crucial discussions we couldn't cover; I encourage your active participation and respond timely because I believe you understand the significance of the EWYL session.
08/12/23, 1:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Sharon
As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"
Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
09/12/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 366 8176: Ooh, another riddle! This one is a classic - it's a "snowflake." Snowflakes don't have mouths, ears, or bodies, but they come alive with the movement of the wind. That's a very creative riddle!
11/12/23, 2:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Sharon
"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." - Helen Keller
This powerful quote by Helen Keller encapsulates the essence of collaboration and collective effort.

Today, let's embrace the strength that lies in our unity and forge ahead towards shared success.
Let's make this session a testament to the incredible achievements possible when we join forces.

I also use the community in networking and reaching out to youths, who I will then refer to enrol with Edoofa Team  and earn scholarship credits

Let's kick off today's session with a quote from the tech maestro, Sundar Pichai:
*"Success is not about the destination. It's about the journey."*

🌟 What it Means:
Imagine your favorite video game. Sure, finishing a level is awesome, but the real joy? It's in navigating the challenges, learning new skills, and enjoying the process.

12/12/23, 2:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 774 8216: I received the message around 1340, I  have network challenges and I'm very sorry for that
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Sharon.
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
