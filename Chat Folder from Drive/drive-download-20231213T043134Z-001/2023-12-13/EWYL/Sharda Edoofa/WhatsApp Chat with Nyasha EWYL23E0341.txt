02/08/23, 2:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
02/08/23, 2:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
02/08/23, 2:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
02/08/23, 2:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
02/08/23, 2:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *_Through WhatsApp community groups_*
02/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Noted Mam
02/08/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
02/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Wow nice thing
02/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Nice sure thing
02/08/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

02/08/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yeah I am going it Mam
02/08/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Nyasha. Take your time.
02/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 655 3182: On this one I'll find out deserving students for the scholarship and lecture them about the program Edoofa scholarship program before they go for the counseling session.  The most targeted students are the ones who've  completed their A level or senior secondary education.  For it to be easier I have to open a community group or Whatsapp group that contains all my students whom I want to teach about Edoofa. Then I will be able to share my group link to those who want an affordable education by Edoofa. Then as my students join my group my job is now to tell them why I've joined them or created the link that is the main reason. I'll be sharing how good it is to be part of an Edoofian in India. What I've to do first is to add my mentor into the group for her to guide me in all procedures and what I'll be doing.
02/08/23, 3:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Nyasha we are done with today's session. Let's meet tomorrow. Have a great day!

03/08/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
03/08/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *1.* Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

*2.* And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not

03/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Ok Mam I'll try to make it all clear to them
03/08/23, 2:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
03/08/23, 2:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
07/08/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Nyasha just keep reminding if you are following.
07/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 655 3182: You're most welcome Mam
07/08/23, 2:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Furthermore, Nyasha, I've observed your dedicated efforts within your group. My expectations for your achievements are elevated, and I encourage you to maintain your commendable work. Keep up the excellent work, dear.
07/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yes Mam I agree and am in the process to go and have some talks with the headmaster
07/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yes Mam am following
07/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Thank you Mam for the compliment and your support at the same time🤝🤝
07/08/23, 2:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *connected* with Edoofa:
07/08/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Proud Edoofian, TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
07/08/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
07/08/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Not yet I need to go there and make it
07/08/23, 2:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
07/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Noted Mam
07/08/23, 2:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright

07/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Ok Mam so let me share with you one of the headmaster's contact pp
07/08/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
07/08/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
07/08/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!

You may ask them to send the forms personally to you.
Once you've verified that all the details on the forms are accurately filled out, you can then forward them to me personally. This approach will streamline our process and help us maintain a thorough check and proper documentation.
08/08/23, 2:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon

08/08/23, 10:10 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Good evening Mam am sorry I couldn't get in touch with you due to poor Network system and power crisis here

09/08/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/08/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: Excuse me for the delay in *Nyasha*. By the time you texted, my working hours were over.

Good Morning Nyasha
Hope you are doing well!

Thank you so much for informing about that. I understand your concern is genuine. Please do not worry at all. We will pick up our sessions from where we left it last time.
09/08/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Ok Mam thank you how are you today
09/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 655 3182: How are you Mam
09/08/23, 2:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon
I hope you are doing really well.


So, are you ready to start our session?
09/08/23, 2:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am great Nyasha
09/08/23, 2:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for asking dear
09/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yes Mam am ready to go it
09/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Am happy for that
09/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Most welcome Mam
09/08/23, 2:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *School Group < 100*
09/08/23, 2:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.

The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.

So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

*1)* either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

or

*2)* ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
09/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 655 3182: I get Mam as I wanted to ask that even though the per term fee will be less than $100 some can still be able to raise the annual fee so I'll make that one by doing what you mentioned above
09/08/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: yess
09/08/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *How to excel in the project?*
09/08/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: SET 1: 

Since you are facing challenges connecting with Headmasters, what we can do is:

1) I can share some contact details with you of those Schools that were earlier not responsive to us with whom you can establish a connection again

2) You can try searching for schools on Google
-Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results. 

So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.

3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.

4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
09/08/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: SET 2 
This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
  ▪️With consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success 
  ▪️Visiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
  ▪️With this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
09/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Noted well Mam
09/08/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 655 3182: I get it Mam and as I am working am looking forward to yield something which will make you proud
09/08/23, 3:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Wonderful Nyasha, and I have all my faith in your efforts dear
09/08/23, 3:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Nyasha- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
09/08/23, 3:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: t’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
09/08/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Ok Mam I'll do so
09/08/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
09/08/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
09/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yes Mam
09/08/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!


 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
09/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yeah I need to know it
09/08/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Noted Mam so I'll learn them as I will be going with my process or
09/08/23, 3:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As our scheduled time comes to a close, I'd like you to be on time tomorrow for the session.
So we will meet tomorrow at the same time

Wishing you a fantastic day ahead.🌼
09/08/23, 3:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: yess
09/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Thanks Mam same to you
09/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Well Mam

*FOURTH*- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, *Ms. Sharda*, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

*FIFTH*- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
14/08/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers.
14/08/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people.
14/08/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
14/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 655 3182: I noted it Mam
14/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Am following

14/08/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor.
14/08/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: yes
14/08/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?
14/08/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Ok Mam

14/08/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
14/08/23, 2:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
14/08/23, 2:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: are you following dear?
14/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yes Mam we're together flowing
14/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yes am aware of this Mam
14/08/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
14/08/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries

I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.

14/08/23, 2:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *There is no deadline for the project.*

*There is no order in which you have to do the project.*

*There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.*

*There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.*
14/08/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: are you following?
14/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yes Mam we're together
14/08/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
14/08/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Wonderful
14/08/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This is it for today.

29/08/23, 12:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am waiting for your session on the EWYL line
29/08/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
29/08/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 655 3182: How are you Mam sorry I'd been inactive due to network problem and  now am trying to fix my Instagram but it is failing
29/08/23, 3:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Ohh Nyasha. It must be because of the networks only.
29/08/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yeah I see because you know what happens when we're in times like these especially here in Zimbabwe we've been in elections so there will be a power and network crisis
29/08/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: hmm I completely understand that
29/08/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
29/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Ok Mam I duely noted it right I wish you a wonderful day
29/08/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 655 3182: But I'll try connecting with you Mam
29/08/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Well Mam so can I have an Instagram link to follow you for the nice session you're going to have tommorow about the *Rakhi*
29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You can follow Edoofa's page Nyasha!
29/08/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Ok Mam I get it
31/08/23, 8:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Nyasha!
How are you?
31/08/23, 2:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
31/08/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Hello Mam am fine how are you doing?

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 12:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.
