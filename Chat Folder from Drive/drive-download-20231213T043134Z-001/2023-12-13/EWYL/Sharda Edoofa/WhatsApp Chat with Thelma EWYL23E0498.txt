25/08/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This is definitely a great plan!

25/08/23, 2:52 pm - +260 777913821: The Earn While You Learn Program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
25/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, that’s correct!
The EWYL (Earn While You Learn) Program aims to provide accessible, affordable, and employable higher education. Through this program, you will acquire 21st-century skills, enhancing your employability for future job opportunities. Additionally, you will earn scholarship credits that will help lower your expenses.
25/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I am delighted to inform you that I have two documents that will provide you with comprehensive information about our program. These documents have been carefully crafted to offer insights into our vision, the courses we offer, and how your entire journey with us will unfold.
25/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It would be best if you allocate today's time to go through the attached document along with your family. It is essential that you read each and every detail attentively, taking your time to fully comprehend the information provided. So, are you ready for the document?
25/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following?
25/08/23, 4:25 pm - +260 777913821: Yes

25/08/23, 4:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moreover, I would like to inform you that during tomorrow's session, I will be available to address any questions you may have. Therefore, it would be helpful if you could take note of any queries that arise while reading the documents. This way, we can ensure that tomorrow's session is both productive and tailored to your specific needs. 

After you are done with the reading, I want you to answer some of my questions to the best of your ability. Our session tomorrow will provide an opportunity to discuss your responses, clarify any uncertainties, and delve deeper into the program's details.
25/08/23, 4:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
29/08/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

I hope you are doing well

Okay Thelma, I have undersatood your point.
In such a case I have another figured out for you.
20/09/23, 2:18 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Thelma

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
20/09/23, 2:18 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
25/09/23, 2:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Happy Monday*
I hope you are doing well

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: *During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family*

 *I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023. We will have our session from 8:30am to 9:30am on Tuesday*
Kindly be available for the same. 
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

Today, let's embrace the strength that lies in our unity and forge ahead towards shared success.

11/12/23, 8:33 am - +260 777913821: Okay
11/12/23, 8:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
11/12/23, 8:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
11/12/23, 8:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
