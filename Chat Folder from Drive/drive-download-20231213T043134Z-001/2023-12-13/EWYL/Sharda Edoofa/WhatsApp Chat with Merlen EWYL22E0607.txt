30/09/23, 9:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening, Merlen!
I trust you're doing well

Our conversation on call was truly enjoyable, and I'd like to kindly remind you of the three tasks you need to complete:

📍 Please ask your *parents to confirm in this group that you've discussed the $300 plan with them*.
📍 *Share a screenshot* of the *Google review* you write for Edoofa.
📍 *share a screenshot* of the *Facebook review* you write for Edoofa.
03/10/23, 8:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
03/10/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 815 2543: Ok ma'am I will try i want feeling well
03/10/23, 8:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Ohh I am sorry to hear that.

03/10/23, 9:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Ohh merlen please take care and drink enough water.
10/10/23, 3:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 3:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
11/10/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then give them resources and information about Edoofa. 

Train them about the process so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.
11/10/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following the discussion Merlen?
11/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 815 2543: Yes
11/10/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Along with that make sure you are giving them an explanation about your journey, about the benefits that you have got and about the skills that you will be acquiring in the process.
11/10/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more
11/10/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!
11/10/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Is everything clear until now?*
11/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 815 2543: Yes ma'am
11/10/23, 3:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Since you are aware that we have our call scheduled on this saturday, please make sure you complete this task by 12:00pm on Friday.*
11/10/23, 3:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *You have to make your testimonial video after arriving in India that should include:*
a) Your journey so far with the Edoofa Scholarship Program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying on your own through an agent and struggling with the process. 
f) Your university experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
11/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 815 2543: Alright ma'am
11/10/23, 3:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I'd like to inform you that we will be conducting two webinars each month. It is crucial that you attend these webinars.

09/12/23, 12:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Merlen,
I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,

Team EWYL
