09/09/23, 10:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings my Proud Edoofian!

Since schools are now open, and I don't want you to be diverted from your studies, I would like to ask about your schedule. This will help me plan our proceedings accordingly and ensure that we can stay connected even if you cannot attend your sessions.🤝🏽
09/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 220 3591: Mostly on Sunday after church service will be free but during the week besides the normal lessons I will be engaged to extra lessons as we are less than a month from the exams.
12/09/23, 8:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Geilen!

How are you doing?
12/09/23, 10:37 am - +263 77 220 3591: Fine and you
14/09/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Geilen!

May I ask about your time table?
14/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 977 5405: Morning how are you
15/09/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Geilen!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 977 5405: 1
15/09/23, 3:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, you know I am available tomorrow for 8:30am to 9:30am. Shall we connect at that time?
15/09/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 977 5405: Ok noted
16/09/23, 8:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Geilen!

How are you? Are you ready for your session?✨

22/09/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?✨
25/09/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263772203591 

How are you? Are you ready to move forward with our discussion?
25/09/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
25/09/23, 9:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
25/09/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 220 3591: No
25/09/23, 9:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *NAME* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
25/09/23, 9:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
25/09/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 220 3591: Noted
25/09/23, 10:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
25/09/23, 10:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 220 3591: Quite understood and encouraging sure
25/09/23, 10:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
25/09/23, 10:11 am - +263 77 220 3591: Achnowledged
25/09/23, 10:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Geilen* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/09/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 220 3591: But Geilen is about to sit for his final paper so to get enough time for now might be a challenge coz he comes late from school as he is also having extra lessons and will be available at home around 2000 hours.
25/09/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 220 3591: Plus fatigue
25/09/23, 10:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, I am just proving you the outline of the program.
25/09/23, 10:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Geilen* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
25/09/23, 10:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
25/09/23, 10:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: -At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Geilen’s EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Geilen* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
25/09/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 220 3591: Thus great
25/09/23, 10:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
25/09/23, 10:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263772203591 

How are you today?
27/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 220 3591: Fine and you
27/09/23, 9:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if you are ready for a discussion now?
27/09/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 220 3591: Go ahead
27/09/23, 9:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 9:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Geilen* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Gelien* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
27/09/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 220 3591: Yes
27/09/23, 9:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how Geilen’s involvement in the EWYL program can bring her closer to reaching her career goals.
27/09/23, 9:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: FIRST- Please note Geilen's batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday - 9:30 am  to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
27/09/23, 9:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
27/09/23, 9:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once, she is back from school, she has to connect here on the line. Before that  I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
28/09/23, 8:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263772203591 

How are you doing?
28/09/23, 10:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263772203591 

How are you doing? Can I know the estimated date by which Blessing can connect with me?
19/10/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I know you're all deep into your studies, and that's fantastic! 📚 But I wanted to share an incredible video with you that I believe can help alleviate some of the exam stress. 🌟

Watch the Video Here : *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpQrMqDoqE&pp=ygU1aGVscGZ1bCB2aWRlbyBmb3IgZXhhbSBzdHJlc3MgZm9yIHN0dWRlbnRzIGluIGVuZ2xpc2g%3D*

Take a little break, relax, and let this video inspire and motivate you. You've got this! 💪
Wishing you all the best of luck with your exams! Stay focused and keep shining. ✨
30/10/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263772203591 @263789775405 @263776279777 

I understand that you're currently dealing with exams, but I've shared a video with you to support your studies. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress and want to see you succeed in your examinations.

I must admit that I'm quite disappointed that there hasn't been a response from you. Communication is essential for us to work together effectively. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Let's ensure we're on the same page and working toward your success.
30/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 220 3591: How are you mentor, long time sure. The guy is busy with his examination but pressure is decreasing gradually as we time progresses. I really understand that communication is important.
Yesterday I was discussing with Geilen's mother that Edoofa is quiet these days kkkk.
31/10/23, 7:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as your child prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

31/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 78 977 5405: The main strategies for coping with stress are to take deep breaths, reassure yourself, talk to someone and exercising as well
07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Geilen and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 6:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 627 9777: I think the EWYL programme work as a relief to parents in raising the fees and that as a student the programme give him the opportunity to get exposure and experience on work related issues.It also gives the student the chance for him to perform to the best of his ability so that other companies can quickly identify you for employment after graduation because of the attitude you gave during those assignments.
17/11/23, 4:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Geilen!
Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity.

This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼
17/11/23, 4:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Let's start our session with an interesting tidbit about India. Did you know that the concept of 'zero' (0) as a mathematical digit was invented by Indian mathematician Aryabhata?

It's a remarkable contribution that has had a profound impact on mathematics and science globally. 🤯

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
08/12/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning,Geilen!

Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. Let us connect on Monday now, as we do not have our sessions over the weekend!

Happy weekend!🚀

Trust me, attending your sessions regularly with your mentor has a big impact on your performance. We analyze these sessions and engagement while evaluating your performance. Not attending the sessions is an alarming situation, so can I know the reason behind your absence?
