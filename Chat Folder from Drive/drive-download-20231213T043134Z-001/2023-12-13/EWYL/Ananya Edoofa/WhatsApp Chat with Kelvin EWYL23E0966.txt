06/12/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 1:38 pm - +27 83 986 0810: It's a tricky one is it a computer keyboard 🤣
06/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, you are right!🚀✨
06/12/23, 1:43 pm - +27 83 986 0810: 😩

06/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:53 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Won nice , thank you 🙏

06/12/23, 2:03 pm - +27 83 986 0810: My name is Kumbirai Kelvin Tsapo.I'm 21 years old.I want to become a Computer Scientist , I like to develop my own apps.I love to play Chess.

 Also, Chess is a great game, isn't it? Do you have a favorite opening?🚀
06/12/23, 2:08 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Yes black 😁
06/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, alright!Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Can you state them please
06/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/12/23, 2:23 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Yes I heard that one.
06/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our today's session here, and I can't wait to connect with you in our next session tomorrow!

07/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
07/12/23, 3:39 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Good afternoon how are you
07/12/23, 3:40 pm - +27 71 707 0139: I have never head of this

08/12/23, 8:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Kelvin

11/12/23, 1:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!🌟

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 1:36 pm - +27 83 986 0810: 🤝
11/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/12/23, 1:38 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Ok
11/12/23, 1:39 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Thank you for the introduction
11/12/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
11/12/23, 1:51 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Great 👊
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:10 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Interesting
11/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
11/12/23, 2:15 pm - +27 83 986 0810: All sections are interesting, for me I can go with the 3 Quotes.
11/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
11/12/23, 2:20 pm - +27 83 986 0810: It is
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, kelvin?
11/12/23, 2:31 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Sounds awesome
11/12/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so let us conclude today's session here, I am really happy with your performance so far! Keep up the good work, and I promise no one can stop you from reaching heights!

12/12/23, 1:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

12/12/23, 1:35 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Ok
12/12/23, 1:42 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Edoofa EWYL program has been an instrument in providing higher education which is accessible , affordable and makes students to be employable after they completed their studies.
12/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Have you noticed the projects under your EWYL program?
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes I have noticed them
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:10 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Corporate Alliances project is to understand the market I am going to work in  , in the future and start preparing myself for it at a very early stage . Due to the pandemic which hit across the globe , businesses moved their operations online . I have to start a LinkedIn account where I indentify jobs on that platform then I applied for them .if I managed to get a job I connect the company to the Edoofa so that they can help me. I will identify my family and friends who can connect me to companies who will help me to get a job in my own country when I finish my studies
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, Kelvin I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes will do that
12/12/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - +27 71 707 0139: I will do that thank you
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great session! As you wrap up, remember the exciting opportunities EWYL projects offer for earning credit. Your dedication is key to success. Dive into these projects, showcase your skills, and watch your efforts pay off academically.

12/12/23, 2:47 pm - +27 71 707 0139: The guide for searching companies which can help on the programme of EWYL firstly you check the Nature of company  , the company must be either student _ centric for example the career development platforms or ed_tech platforms.It could also be a recreational platform for example virtual ,gaming platforms, podcasts and musical apps.
12/12/23, 2:52 pm - +27 71 707 0139: You must also check the scale of the company . the companies selected must not be too big or too small . It must have employee size of 50 to 200. I must also consider the company's financial stability so that it can manage to help with the funding.I also have to check the background of the founder if the founder has a strong background in terms of experience and qualifications
