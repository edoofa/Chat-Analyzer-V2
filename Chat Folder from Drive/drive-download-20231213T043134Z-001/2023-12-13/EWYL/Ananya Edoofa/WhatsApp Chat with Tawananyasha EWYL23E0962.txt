11/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,Tawananyasha!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!🌟

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Okay thank you
11/12/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Two objectives of EWYL is to earn maximum scholarship credits so as to reduce the cost of higher education .This will make it affordable.

Then also to make sure that students are  employable  after completing higher education.That is they meet the world's standards required  by employers.
11/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing! Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 234 0173: Thank you  for expanding the objectives ,I am following as well.
11/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 234 0173: Welcome Ms Davi and Ms Sanjana ,we happy to have you on board and travel this journey together.
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
11/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Thank you I understand
11/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Yh it does sound very much interesting
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so let us conclude today's session here, I am really happy with your performance so far! Keep up the good work, and I promise no one can stop you from reaching heights!

12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tawananyasha!

Did you know octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two pumps to the gills, and one to the body. They're basically the rockstars of the ocean with a unique sense of style! Now, let's dive into our session with that octopus energy!🐙
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Good afternoon
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 575 1120: I’m excited for the session we can start
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Me too but I enjoyed the section entitled two questions for u the most
12/12/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 575 1120: It sounds great actually
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 575 1120: What I have noticed is that EWYL really equips you to a better person as you will acquire skills that are not offered by other programs
12/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 575 1120: You are able to support yourself even financially
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed, Tawananyasha!
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Yes it is
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Let me do that right away
12/12/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Are you done, Tawananyasha?
12/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 575 1120: Not yet the book is quite big
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright!
12/12/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great session! As you wrap up, remember the exciting opportunities EWYL projects offer for earning credit. Your dedication is key to success. Dive into these projects, showcase your skills, and watch your efforts pay off academically.
