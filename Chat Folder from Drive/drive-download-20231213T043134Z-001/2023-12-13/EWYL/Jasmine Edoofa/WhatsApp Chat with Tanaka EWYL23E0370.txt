Feel free to express if you have problems regarding the timings so that I can reschedule it so that you could be present and maximize your learning opportunities. Let's have a productive and successful journey.

It will be your responsibility to message me five minutes prior to the session to mark your attendance.
During these sessions, I will provide you with information on the EWYL program, our various projects that you can work on to earn credits, and also about our program structure.

This is known as our onboarding phase. Once the onboarding is complete, you will begin working on projects, and I will be there to guide you through any obstacles you may encounter.
16/08/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Ok I am on board and also the time is good 👍
16/08/23, 2:26 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?

The objectives of EWYL are to help the students to learn and to acquire 21st-century life skills
17/08/23, 7:50 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!

17/08/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 575 4358: Good afternoon i am ready for the session
17/08/23, 2:02 pm - +91 78273 08969: Please reply to this.
17/08/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 575 4358: No i do not understand
17/08/23, 2:05 pm - +91 78273 08969: Am I speaking to Tanaka or someone else?
17/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 575 4358: Yes you are speaking to Tanaka
17/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 575 4358: I am not aware of the objectives please helping
17/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 575 4358: .. Help
17/08/23, 2:07 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our Edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
17/08/23, 2:18 pm - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
17/08/23, 2:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 575 4358: I have finished reading
17/08/23, 2:42 pm - +91 78273 08969: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
17/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 575 4358: I liked the story of the young six year old Arhman Om Talsania who defied all the odds at at very young age and proved that talent is not dependent on age its based also on hard work and determination and honestly speaking i was inspired by the youngster
17/08/23, 2:49 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 2:49 pm - +91 78273 08969: Tanaka, This is the newsletter. Please read this.
17/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 575 4358: I finished reading. Should i answer the questions
17/08/23, 3:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: yes, please
17/08/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 575 4358: Sry for the late reply network issues
17/08/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 575 4358: 1.Accountability is considered a double edged sword because it enables one to claim credit for successes and to shoulder the weight of failures as well hence instilling incentives and build credibility

2. Embracing accountability and ownership of one's acts reduces the fear of public failure under one's name. This biulds a sense if willingness in one's self to embrace public failure giving one the resilience to keep on going until success is attained
17/08/23, 4:05 pm - +91 78273 08969: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
17/08/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 575 4358: Yes of course everyone would want that
17/08/23, 4:06 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, You are right.
 I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
17/08/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 575 4358: Yes i am ready
17/08/23, 4:09 pm - +91 78273 08969: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

17/08/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 575 4358: 1. On my EWYL team there is Ms. Deepali who is the head of the department and she monitors all group discussions whenever her guidance is needed. And then there is Ms. Davi who is the head coach and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum, and not forgetting my mentor Ms. Tenzin who is determined and dedicated in ensuring that i earn as mhch experience for the future as i need

17/08/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 575 4358: 4.Hall of inspiration for me personally i think its a group of people who have made it in the world who could be a great example for inspiring the ones pursuing their dream and giving them self confidence that they can achieve what they want just like the words of MAHATMA GANDHI "The mind is everything. What you think you become"

21/08/23, 7:06 pm - +263 71 654 9013: based on the document i read in today's covid affected world we can bet on two things 1.Aquiring skills and 2. Awareness . I understood that due to the outbreak of the corona pandemic many businesses moved their operations online and examples are that meetings were replaced by video calls and classes became webinars . This is why the people from EDOOFA made this document to provide the skills that are emerging, and the skills are 1.online skills and literacy- whereby it is important to have the ability of being resourceful onine. 2.social media literacy - this is oneof the most important skill that one needs to acquire whereby as the businesses now rely on social for engaging with customers one must acquire the skill on attaining and retaining customers through social media platforms.3.remote team-work - the ability to virtually coordinate with team members in different geographies. And then  there are Enduring skills -which require a high degree of creativity and also immagination . these skills are 1.business development  2.networking 3 . decision making and risk taking . About project 1   there is a primary outcome: whereby Edoofians will represent Edoofa to build a network of patner companies and potential employers and in doing this it helps them earn scholarship credits  . the skill sets covered are 1 networking skills , building confidence and good communication skills and the mind sets covered are reaching out to people who are influential , facing failure and trying and trying again and again . The guidelines for the students are that 1. students will identify local organisations  2. identify the decision-makers in those organisations 3.reaching out to these individuals to share Edoofa's vision and the work it does 4. Arrangement of a call meetingbetween Edoofa and the organisations and finally 5. facilitating the signing of the contract.  And then project 2 - Community building  : 1. primary outcome  : students will reach out to their extended and personal networks and offer them an  to be part of edoofa's educational ecosystem and acquire international education .  2. Skillsets covered : networking skills persuasion skills and leveraging social media  . 3 mindsets covered : identifying an opportunity and to be enthusiastic about it . Further sharing such opportunities openly to create an impact  in other people's lives : and the guidelines and directions : the students are expected to show their persuasion  skills , the students will have to reach out to the African students who have graduated from senior secondary schools either recently or in the past six months and refer them to the Edoofa program.

23/08/23, 2:18 pm - +91 78273 08969: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
23/08/23, 2:18 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>

23/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 654 9013: the objective of the project is to gain an understanding of the market i plan to enter in the future and to start preparing for it at this early stage. My task is to identify  the technologically driven and digital companies and this can be accomplished by starting with my family members , neighbours or parents of friends who work in the service sector . I am supposed to share the objectives and explain how EDOOFA is preparing me develop the required skills for future employability after graduation . A linkedin account is required as it allows me to search for companies and connect with the employies . I am required to required to reach out to the employies and managers of such companies and prepare a meeting with EDOOFA members .
23/08/23, 2:56 pm - +91 78273 08969: Amazing, thanks Tanaka.. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
23/08/23, 2:56 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 654 9013: the task is to look for porential companies that can collaborate with EDOOFA and are willing to help in the overall development of all the students that enroll for the EDOOFA programme . The factors to be considered are 1 . Nature of company whereby the  nature of the company could be recreational or student-centric  2. Scale of company : the scale should be neither too big or too small it should be somewhere in between 50 -200  3. Financial stability  : Companies must be financially stable  4. Background of founder : founder must have a strong background  and platforms that can be used : Google : LinkedIn and social media pages such as FACEBOOK ,INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER   and the steps to follow are STEP 1 :searching , for this LinkedIn is used and it can give you a brief explanation of the company's mission ,the profile links to the company's employees . STEP 2 : Study more about the company, for this google is the best platform to use . Step 3 : study the website of the company and check if it is working properly . STEP 4 : check various social media platforms of the company like Facebook ,Instagram ,Twitter ,this is to get a better understanding of the company's activities . STEP 5 : study the background of the founder and the other core members [LinkedIn is the best source] STEP 6 : send an invitation note or a connection request , starting with the heads of departments like marketing managers ,community managers before consulting the founder of the company
23/08/23, 3:42 pm - +91 78273 08969: You know what Tanaka, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

25/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 654 9013: community building refers to the process of establishing and strengthening connections , relationships and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community . this involves the creation of an environment that provides a sense of belonging among students leading to the collaboration of the students to achieve common goals . The goal of community building is to foster a positive and cohesive  community that provides social interaction in a shared sense of  honership towards achieving collective surfaces , the primary outcome for this project is for students to develop networking skills and persuasion skills and leveraging   social media to offer African students an opportunity to  join EDOOFA education ecosystem . By reaching out to extended and personal  networks students will identify motivated youths who are looking to have great careers and direct them towards this opportunity .This projects encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunity and sharing them openly to create an impact in the life of others . TO complete this project students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools or are currently in their final year of senior secondary education . Students will be required to use their networking and persuasion skills to refer the students to the programme and help the organisation grow. This helps the students to earn scholarship credits for every student that enrolls and pays the first part of the enrollment fee
25/08/23, 2:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: That’s awesome- Tanaka, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

28/08/23, 2:58 pm - +91 78273 08969: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 654 9013: ok
28/08/23, 2:59 pm - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
28/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 654 9013: noted
28/08/23, 3:06 pm - +91 78273 08969: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

28/08/23, 3:13 pm - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.

28/08/23, 3:15 pm - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!

_Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._



Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

04/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Okay noted
04/09/23, 2:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.

04/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Ok
04/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 78273 08969: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Tenzin, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
04/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Noted
04/09/23, 2:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: Do let me know when you are done.
04/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Ok
04/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 350 6654: I have finished
04/09/23, 3:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

04/09/23, 3:11 pm - +91 78273 08969: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
05/09/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Good afternoon Ms Tenzin I am now going to school for my final term unfortunately I will not be available for the sessions until end of term
05/09/23, 12:14 pm - +91 78273 08969: Please write an email to deepali@edoofa.com and tenzin.edoofa@gmail.com stating you are keeping the EWYL program on hold and stating the reason and your resume date as well.
05/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Ok ma'am, I am noted.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
28/09/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 350 6654: Good morning, ma'am! At the moment, Tanaka is at school.  He started writing his final examinations on Monday. He will be done by 24 November. 
So, due to the preparations for the exam and poor network at his school, it will be best to resume on 25 November for anything that requires Tanaka's input.
If there is anything that we his parents can answer, we can do that at anytime.
28/09/23, 8:56 am - +91 78273 08969: Thank you so much for the information.
29/09/23, 12:49 pm - +91 78273 08969: Dear Tanaka,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Jasmine your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Jasmine's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.
29/09/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 350 6654: Hello ma'am!! Hopefully you are recovering well. 
As Tanaka's parents we are so grateful of your help to our son. It was a pleasure working with you.  We learnt to be patient, tolerant and to be able to encourage others. I personally have noted where I need to improve in communication. You did not only mentor Tanaka but the family at large. May the Almighty God restore your health so that you can procee with the good work he made for you. Joel 2:25-26.
Till we meet again God bless you and enlarge your territory

28/11/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.

28/11/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

28/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 350 6654: I really liked the section from the second newsletter where Mr Angah Singh says that not everything is simple ,the best things in life demand some work ,there are no shortcuts to success , but hard work combined with perseverance, aspiration and a constant drive  to pursue your objectives can increase your chances of success and nevertheless I really liked the words by Collin Powell "There are no secrets to success .It is the result of preparation ,hardwork and learning from failure"
28/11/23, 9:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, The entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?

Project 1 is whereby EDOOFIANS will represent EDOOFA to build a network of partner companies and potential employers . Under this project students will identify local organisations in their region  and find the decision makers of those institutions and reach out to them to share EDOOFA's vision and arrange a call between EDOOFA and the decision makers and facilitating the signing of the contracts.         3. Project 2  is about community building whereby EDOOFIANS  will reach out to their personal and extended networks and offer them an opportunity to be a part of the EDOOFA scholarship Program  , for this project I will have to reach out to African students who have graduated from senior secondary schools either recently or in the past six months and refer them to the EDOOFA scholarship Program.                 4. Project 3 , under this project, students will reach out to various schools in their region and help EDOOFA tie  up with them, and it will be a non-commercial tie-up where EDOOFA wants to help schools by the way of sharing world class technology and innovations happening in Indian schools so that African schools improve their education delivery and outcomes

My task is to identify companies which are technologically driven and digital in my region and I can start by reaching out to my Immediate network which include family members or friends and I can explain to them my objectives and how EDOOFA is helping me develop the necessary skills for future employment after graduation. To further expand my network and connect with professionals in the industry a LinkedIn account is required which helps me connect with multiple companies and connect with the employees,  after reaching out to the employees and managers I must share the call details with the EDOOFA administration board,  creating this LinkedIn account will enhance  my credibility and increase  my chances of securing internships and gaining industrial exposure

04/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 907 4224: The most effective way to execute the project . For this I must create a whatsapp group and the next step is to identify the right students who can be part of the group,  the goal is reach out to large number of students and provide them with the necessary information about EDOOFA before the counseling session,  to find the right students I can get in touch with my schoolmates who are currently in form 6 or who have already passed their form 6 , the main reason of creating this whatsapp group is to reach out to a larger audience using less energy, I will be sharing information about the exciting opportunity to pursue education in India , before I start interacting with the participants in the group I should add you as my mentor so that you will be tracking my progress

06/12/23, 8:47 am - +263 77 907 4224: I remember we talked about creating a whatsapp group where I will reach out to extended networks and reach out to students who have recently finished their senior year or have just graduated from senior secondary schools and enlighten them on the benefits of joining the EDOOFA scholarship Program
06/12/23, 8:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Tanaka, I am impressed with your understanding. <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 8:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -

06/12/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

08/12/23, 9:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 907 4224: Noted
08/12/23, 9:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
08/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 907 4224: Noted
08/12/23, 9:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
