Before we embark on this journey together,I would like to check in with you and your family. How are you all doing today?
04/09/23, 7:58 pm - +260 97 5963257: We are doing very well as a family and thank you so much for giving us an opportunity to be part of the Edoofa family.
04/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Natasha. First and foremost, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family for the wonderful choice of enrolling in the Edoofa program.

*Our goal here always remains the same*: to ensure that every Edoofian is treated with the same respect and care, and now that you've been accepted into the scholarship program, I'd like to walk you through the steps you'll be taking.
04/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: At the same time, please be informed of our operational hours, spanning from *12:00 pm to 04:00 pm CAT* and *07:30 pm to 10:30 pm CAT*. I kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots.

Can I safely assume that you've taken note of our designated discussion hours, dear?
04/09/23, 8:31 pm - +260 97 5963257: By the way, I am Natasha's Aunt.  Natasha has reported back to school today being her last term as she prepares to sit for her final Grade 12 examinations in November.  While at School no pupil is allowed to carry a cell phone with them.  This means that you will only engage with me for time being until when Natasha comes back from school.  This was mentioned to Mr Sagar and Mr Shubham.
04/09/23, 8:34 pm - +260 97 5963257: As regards timings, is this Indian time?  I need to know the timings properly because I am in full time employment and there are at times I am occupied with work.  So for me evenings like this will be appropriate.  Thank you.
04/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand now. Thank you for sharing the information with me in advance. I recognize that attending school might pose challenges for your participation. I would like both you and your parents to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and our sessions can also involve only your parents at times.
04/09/23, 9:05 pm - +260 97 5963257: Well noted thank you.
04/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Excellent! I'd like to bring an important aspect to your attention. This collective aim strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you as guardians or the student won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand.
04/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Over the next four days, our main focus will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey.

I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups?
04/09/23, 10:14 pm - +260 97 5963257: Very clear Sir and well explained.  The process sounds interesting.

05/09/23, 8:26 pm - +260 97 5963257: <Media omitted>

05/09/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please ask, I am more than happy to help you.
05/09/23, 8:44 pm - +260 97 5963257: 1.  The program has to commence almost immediate.  Now, what about us whose children have gone back to school?  The same concern was raised with the Counsellor.  2.  On the form there is a provision for Natasha to sign and yet she is not available to do that.  In this case she can only be available to commence the program once she is back in November/December 2023.  3.  Now how do I sign and commence the program without Natasha?
05/09/23, 8:44 pm - +260 97 5963257: Please guide me.
05/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the question 1 may I know if you are referring to the EWYL program?
05/09/23, 9:29 pm - +260 97 5963257: Very correct Sir
05/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the second concern. The parents can sign on her behalf as well.
05/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know in that case we can schedule the session according to her availability.
05/09/23, 9:31 pm - +260 97 5963257: This is better Sir.
05/09/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now how do I sign and commence the program without Natasha?

Regarding the above question you can mention the date where She would be available along with the reason in the form
05/09/23, 9:32 pm - +260 97 5963257: If I sign the form on EWYL it requires indicating date of commencement of the program, so which date should appear on the form?
05/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You would be required to enter the date when Natasha would be available.
05/09/23, 9:39 pm - +260 97 5963257: thank you very much for your guidance
05/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Regarding the three forms shared with you, they are ideally meant to be completed and submitted by tomorrow at 12:30 PM.

Hence, could you kindly let me know by when do you anticipate being able to fill out these forms?
05/09/23, 9:47 pm - +260 97 5963257: Sir is this Zambian time 12:30 PM or IST?

06/09/23, 2:15 pm - +260 97 5963257: I am online Sir waiting
06/09/23, 2:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, thank you for sharing the forms with us, I have taken a note of these and will update them in our records as well. 

Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
06/09/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 5963257: Thanks and well noted.
06/09/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 2:33 pm - +260 97 5963257: This well understood Sir.
06/09/23, 2:34 pm - +260 97 5963257: You may go ahead and explain in detail.
06/09/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
06/09/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
06/09/23, 2:42 pm - +260 97 5963257: Very clear indeed
06/09/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
06/09/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
06/09/23, 2:44 pm - +260 97 5963257: Following keenly
06/09/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
06/09/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/09/23, 2:50 pm - +260 97 5963257: I have a question on step 5.  How long does it take to receive Letter of Intent from the university?  Secondly, what determines registration fee?  Last one, How much time/period is given to pay the registration fees after receiving letter of intent?
06/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the concern with me. After you give us the official go-ahead for the scholarship application it will take a weeks time for the arrival of the offer letter.
06/09/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The deadline for the payment of the fees will be two weeks from the date of arrival of the offer letter. However, it is totally dependent on the university.
06/09/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $1000, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
06/09/23, 3:23 pm - +260 97 5963257: Well explained and we are on the same page, thank you.
06/09/23, 4:01 pm - +260 97 5963257: Are we done for the day?
06/09/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply our first slot of the day had just ended. Please let me know if you would like to continue further ?
06/09/23, 8:19 pm - +260 97 5963257: Ok noted.  We may continue but  not beyond 1 hour, pls guide
06/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Since it has almost passed 1 hour. May I know if you would like to further proceed tomorrow?
06/09/23, 9:16 pm - +260 97 5963257: Yes Sir tomorrow will be fine, let me know the time.  Thanks
06/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if the time 7:30 PM works for you?

06/09/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, it works. We shall connect at the said time frame.

08/09/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
08/09/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
08/09/23, 2:43 pm - +260 96 3395120: Yes pls you may proceed

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
08/09/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
08/09/23, 3:01 pm - +260 96 3395120: Received with thanks.  I will manage to finish by tomorrow afternoon, this is due to power supply challenges.  At the same time I need to go through slowly in order to grasp what is in each video.  Many thanks.
08/09/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. In that case, shall I schedule our session for Monday at 1:30 PM as tomorrow is a weekend?
08/09/23, 8:23 pm - +260 97 5963257: Sure not a problem, I will be available.  Thank you

08/09/23, 8:58 pm - +260 97 5963257: Thank you Sir and wish you a happy weekend
11/09/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Natasha .  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you on time.

Please let me know if you are available so we can proceed further with our session?
11/09/23, 8:18 pm - +260 97 5963257: Good evening Sir, it is well we can connect.
11/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
11/09/23, 9:14 pm - +260 96 3395120: Yes Sir I watched all the 4 videos, though alone without Natasha as you know.  My wish is for her to watch/listen to them.  Well explained.
11/09/23, 9:16 pm - +260 96 3395120: As for the last or 4th one last noticed that the video was suppose to have a form which I guess should be filled in by Natasha.  Otherwise the videos are insightful.
11/09/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
11/09/23, 9:44 pm - +260 96 3395120: Video 1 talked about important qualities of students who are enrolled and how happy  they are  for being Edoofans. Important things to do; follow instructions and create time
Video 2, talks about Edoofas vision and also important character traits that distinguishes a successful student from others.
Video 3, schools colleges and universities under Edoofa program...to help students choose the best university.  250 top universities are available to choose from.  It also helps student to choose from already accredited university and that it has conducive environment to match the required standards of international students etc 
Video 4, preparation for interactive sessions with schools. Edoofa will arrange interactive sessions with schools while the student credentials also have to be presented to the potential schools/universities to enable them make informed decisions.
In summary that's all I can share
11/09/23, 9:44 pm - +260 96 3395120: Thank you
11/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
11/09/23, 9:57 pm - +260 96 3395120: Yes we are.  Thank you.
11/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, . Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
11/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
11/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
11/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!

11/09/23, 10:30 pm - +260 96 3395120: Thanks for sharing.  As regards feedback I think 1.30pm tomorrow will be too early for me, I would suggest 19:30hrs or 7.30 pm.  I need abit of time.
11/09/23, 10:36 pm - +260 96 3395120: Another suggestion, since Natasha is not around can't it be possible to wait for her to give the answers to the questions bearing in mind that this is a very crucial stage which also involves choosing a university.  I feel certain steps/decisions have to be taken in her presence.  My submission sir.
12/09/23, 2:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Natasha. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Thank you for letting me know of the same. It is all alright, the above tasks are to be filled by Natasha, and since she is not available we can put a hold on the same. So, in the mean time. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
12/09/23, 2:42 pm - +260 97 5963257: Good afternoon Sir, thank you for understanding on that part.  I hope you understood my concern, as family we would like Natasha to take ownership of the whole process and seek clarity wherever possible so that at the end of it all she would know her expectations.  For now we can proceed and hoping the session will focus alot on the parents.

Then 3, she will be getting her national I.D and Passport when back from School.  In this case kindly advise how we can proceed i  the absence of 1 and 3.

12/09/23, 4:49 pm - +260 96 3395120: On this one kindly allow me to find out from the mother when the documents can be availed.
12/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended. Certainly I shall wait for the same.

18/09/23, 8:49 pm - +260 97 5963257: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 8:49 pm - +260 97 5963257: Good evening Sir, sorry for the silence.  Update on the documents:
1. We have only managed to collect the recommendation letter from School today.
3.  As regards National identity/ birth certificate,  we have a challenge the Department wants Natasha to be present before issuing her with I.D and birth certificate.  Meaning that these documents can only be issued once she is back in November.
Kindly bear with us.

Therefore, we can only avail to you the mother's I.D. or better still we wait for Natasha's national I.D and birth certificate.  I seek your further guidance.

03/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Natasha. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session?
03/10/23, 7:47 pm - +260 97 5963257: Good evening sir, sorry for late response.  I was knocking off at the time you sent message.  Now that I am back at work we can only chat during lunch 13.00hrs to 14hrs or evening.

I managed to get a detailed letter from the school.  What is remaining now is her  ID which she will get as soon as comes back next month.
03/10/23, 7:47 pm - +260 97 5963257: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA  and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
03/10/23, 8:44 pm - +260 97 5963257: Very accurate info for Natasha
03/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
03/10/23, 9:19 pm - +260 97 5963257: Yes Sir.
03/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
03/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
03/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
03/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
03/10/23, 10:10 pm - +260 97 5963257: Much appreciated 👏🏻👏🏻
04/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 5:45 pm - +260 97 5963257: Evening chats will be best Sir.  Leaving my work place now
04/10/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, please let me know when you are available so that we can proceed with the session.
04/10/23, 5:50 pm - +260 97 5963257: Sure l will do so.
04/10/23, 7:56 pm - +260 97 5963257: I am available for a chat now.
04/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process. <This message was edited>
04/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/10/23, 8:37 pm - +260 97 5963257: Yes the counsellor mentioned this.
04/10/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 - $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Unfortunately, I experienced a lack of response from your end during our recent attempts at communication. Nevertheless, I remain committed to our discussion and sincerely wish to proceed.

To accommodate our conversation, I propose we meet at 5:00 PM on Monday. I hope this timing works well for you.

Wishing you a wonderful week ahead, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family.
07/10/23, 3:14 pm - +260 97 5963257: noted with thanks.  l acknowledged the last message you sent and read through but had no comment to make as it was well understood.  thank you.
09/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?

I am doing great, thank you for asking.
09/10/23, 6:40 pm - +260 97 5963257: Good evening Sir, you may proceed.
09/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 6:48 pm - +260 97 5963257: Yes we are and am aware of the info shared.
09/10/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - +260 97 5963257: Yes well explained.  Noted the assumed 100% offer coming to K1350 per annum.
09/10/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
09/10/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350  - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $175 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
09/10/23, 8:10 pm - +260 97 5963257: Ok, my understanding on this one is that once Natasha receives her acceptance letter from the university of her choice then the K1000 registration has to be paid, is this right?
My hope and prayer is that she receives a 100% scholarship.
09/10/23, 8:12 pm - +260 97 5963257: The other thing I wanted to mention is that she has to participate in choosing her dream university which can only happen next month as she returns home.  Is this acceptable?
09/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, your understanding is correct. Once Natasha receives her acceptance letter from the university of her choice and hopes she secures a 100% scholarship, the registration fee of K1000 will need to be paid to reserve her scholarship seat.

Regarding her participation in choosing her dream university, it's absolutely acceptable. We want Natasha to be comfortable and confident in her choice of university. When she returns home next month and has the opportunity to thoroughly consider her options, we can proceed with finalizing the university selection and the subsequent steps in the admission process.
09/10/23, 8:58 pm - +260 97 5963257: This is very much appreciated Sir🙏🏼  and well understood.
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
09/10/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/10/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and let's connect tomorrow at 5:00 PM. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
09/10/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 10:18 pm - +260 97 5963257: Well said Sir and clear So far.
09/10/23, 10:18 pm - +260 97 5963257: Much appreciated and blessed night 🙏🏼
10/10/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 7:39 pm - +260 97 5963257: Apologies Sir unable to continue today I have a work commitment this evening.  Can we continue tomorrow around 7 PM
10/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Of course, I understand. We can definitely continue our discussion tomorrow around 7 PM.
12/10/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” – Nelson Mandela*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session. 

If you are available for the session shall we begin?
17/10/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Natasha!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for a quite sometime now. This has raised some concerns on my part, so I wanted to inquire about your well-being and if you might be encountering any challenges at the moment kindly let me know of the same. .
17/10/23, 6:43 pm - +260 97 5963257: Good evening Sir, yes l have had  challenges  work related and family issues.  In my previous msg I mentioned that being in full time employment poses a big challenge such that  most of the time knocking off late.  But as soon as Natasha comes back home in a few weeks' time at least our level of engagement will improve.  I can only request for your patience when you notice am inactive online due to above reasons.  Right now just knocked off and getting home now which is 26km from my work station.  I hope my explanation clears your concerns. Regards.
17/10/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the challenges you're facing. I completely understand, and your explanation is much appreciated. Family and work responsibilities are indeed important, and I value your dedication to ensuring Natasha's education is a priority.

Whenever you have the opportunity and availability, we can proceed with the session. So, may I know if you could please share with me a time that you might be comfortable to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 8:27 pm - +260 97 5963257: You may proceed Sir.
17/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
17/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
17/10/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 8:36 pm - +260 97 5963257: Very inspiring indeed👍🏼 I am sure Natasha will be very happy to read through this and admire the pic
17/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
17/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
17/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
17/10/23, 8:48 pm - +260 97 5963257: This is so much appreciated for extending the endowment.  We look forward to its benefits.  Thanks you
17/10/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

17/10/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
18/10/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.
18/10/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: @260963395120 @260962274763 @260975963257
18/10/23, 5:50 pm - +260 97 5963257: Evening Sir, l have read the msg and wish to respond as follows:
1.  last evening we had a chat where l explained certain challenges l am facing regarding our level of engagement in Natasha's admission process.  Your last msg asked me to review the benefits in detail to which l only finished very late in the night.  So my intention was to respond  today after knocking from work.  To my surprise again you send a msg during the day when l am engaged with National duties and we are not allowed to be online all the time.
2.  You may wish to know that Natasha's process is undertaken by Natasha (in school) and myself only.  Meaning currently it is only me involved not until she comes back next month.  Unfortunately you are relating other families to our situation, which should not be the case.
3.  There are certain decision especially those pertaining to choosing the universities etc which cannot be made on behalf of Natasha and  also obtaining the national ID or passport.  
4.  I have tried within my limited  time to participate and l did mention that once my niece comes back she will be online most of the time.
Lastly l hope you will understand our situation as it is  and looking forward to a more flexible engagement so as not to miss out on the opportunities  in the admission process.
18/10/23, 5:51 pm - +260 97 5963257: I have reviewed these benefits we can proceed.
18/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing your feedback, and I truly appreciate your understanding of the situation. I completely comprehend the challenges you're facing regarding engagement and availability, especially with Natasha being in school and your responsibilities with national duties.

Regarding your concerns about involving other family members, my intention was to ensure that if, at any point, another family member is available and can assist or engage in the process, they are welcome to do so. However, I fully understand that Natasha's admission process primarily involves you and her, and important decisions should be made by Natasha herself when possible.

I sincerely appreciate your efforts in finding time within your busy schedule to participate in the admission process, and I'm more than willing to be flexible and accommodate your availability. We can tailor our discussions and sessions to align with Natasha's availability once she is back. Let's proceed with discussing the benefits of the Endowment Program, focusing on the points you mentioned.
18/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 6:12 pm - +260 97 5963257: This is good news and benefits that come with it.  Well explained and very clear info relating to the endowment programme.
18/10/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 6:18 pm - +260 97 5963257: Yes it does, sounds exciting.
18/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 6:27 pm - +260 97 5963257: In case more than one university sends letters  of intent, does it mean on each letter there is need to pay USD150?
18/10/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The $150 will be granted by Edoofa and you have to pay once only for the registration fee. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 6:53 pm - +260 97 5963257: Oh ok thanks
18/10/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 8:57 pm - +260 97 5963257: Well followed Sir.  Sorry l had internet challenges
18/10/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, it is alriht.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 9:01 pm - +260 97 5963257: Not aware kindly provide more info on that
18/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/10/23, 9:05 pm - +260 97 5963257: Well noted and very exciting process
18/10/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 9:26 pm - +260 97 5963257: Yes at least they can be given a leverage
18/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - +260 97 5963257: Yes clear
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 9:36 pm - +260 97 5963257: Very  clear Sir
18/10/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 9:45 pm - +260 97 5963257: No questions for now l will  need to digest this.  Otherwise it is clear and thank you
18/10/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Natasha's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Natasha is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?

16/11/23, 2:23 pm - +260 97 5963257: I hope this answers your questions
16/11/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
16/11/23, 2:35 pm - +260 97 5963257: Absolutely Sir!! As a family we deeply indebted to the Edoofa management and the MVN university management for awarding Natasha a 100% scholarship.
16/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's fantastic news! A 100% scholarship for tuition and accommodation is a significant achievement and a huge relief financially. It's wonderful to hear how appreciative your family is for this opportunity. Natasha's academic journey will indeed be more accessible and smoother due to this generous scholarship. It's a testament to her hard work and potential.
16/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
16/11/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1000.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1000 + $250 (EDP & Book Bank Fee) = $1250.
16/11/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?

20/11/23, 2:17 pm - +260 96 2274763 joined using this group's invite link
20/11/23, 2:17 pm - +260 96 2274763: Afternoon sir!
20/11/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings dear. How was your exams?
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - +260 96 2274763: Tricky if you ask me, but fair enough.
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - +260 96 2274763: How are you doing?
20/11/23, 2:23 pm - +260 97 5963257: Good afternoon Team
20/11/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking, dear. So, if you are all ready shall we proceed with the session?
20/11/23, 2:29 pm - +260 96 2274763: Yes we can!
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
20/11/23, 2:32 pm - +260 96 2274763: Yes it's clear.
20/11/23, 2:32 pm - +260 96 2274763: I do have a question though.
20/11/23, 2:33 pm - +260 96 2274763: During my absence, my mom told me that I had received an acceptance letter from one of the universities, MVN university if I'm not mistaken.
20/11/23, 2:34 pm - +260 96 2274763: Could you please tell me more about this university?
20/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed, you did. I will be providing you with insights into the university as we proceed with the session. Could you confirm if you were able to go through the offer letter and our previous conversations that I had with your mother?
20/11/23, 2:40 pm - +260 96 2274763: No I did not.
20/11/23, 2:40 pm - +260 96 2274763: I just arrived.
20/11/23, 2:40 pm - +260 96 2274763: I have another question
20/11/23, 2:41 pm - +260 96 2274763: I'm i able to tell you about my dream university? And if I do will you help me receive an acceptance letter from it?
20/11/23, 2:45 pm - +260 96 2274763: And also before I left, you had indicated that you would help me receive more than just one university acceptance letter. When we likely to receive the rest?

It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?

20/11/23, 4:13 pm - +260 96 2274763: Yes it is.

3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)

[5:53 pm, 16/11/2023] +260 97 5963257: I hope this answers your questions
[5:59 pm, 16/11/2023] Shivjeet - Admission Officer: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
[6:05 pm, 16/11/2023] +260 97 5963257: Absolutely Sir!! As a family we deeply indebted to the Edoofa management and the MVN university management for awarding Natasha a 100% scholarship.
[6:22 pm, 16/11/2023] Shivjeet - Admission Officer: That's fantastic news! A 100% scholarship for tuition and accommodation is a significant achievement and a huge relief financially. It's wonderful to hear how appreciative your family is for this opportunity. Natasha's academic journey will indeed be more accessible and smoother due to this generous scholarship. It's a testament to her hard work and potential.
[6:22 pm, 16/11/2023] Shivjeet - Admission Officer: As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
[6:23 pm, 16/11/2023] Shivjeet - Admission Officer: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1000.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1000 + $250 (EDP & Book Bank Fee) = $1250.
[6:23 pm, 16/11/2023] Shivjeet - Admission Officer: It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
[6:36 pm, 16/11/2023] +260 97 5963257: Not clear on the last part where you have said This cost  ($1250) is applicable for the first year only an again you have mentioned hat second year onwards, annual cost of education will be $1250?  pls clarify
[6:39 pm, 16/11/2023] Shivjeet - Admission Officer: Please excuse me for the error I am sharing you with a corrected version of the message. 

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1000. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
[6:42 pm, 16/11/2023] +260 97 5963257: Oh ok well noted.  
Now l was requesting for flexible payment terms on the registration fee.
[6:46 pm, 16/11/2023] Shivjeet - Admission Officer: I will come to that very soon. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of Natasha's per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank

I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
[6:52 pm, 16/11/2023] +260 97 5963257: Great news and much appreciated.  On no. 5 What does EDB and Book bank stand for?

[7:05 pm, 16/11/2023] +260 97 5963257: Otherwise I have gone through the message and it is clear Sir. Thank you

The Book Bank provides free textbook access to economically disadvantaged students, aiding education without financial strain. Please do not worry about that for now. Also kindly let me know if you are clear here?

https://chat.whatsapp.com/GEcy4mtJi9h3BUmNWog7MG
[5:47 pm, 20/11/2023] +260 96 2274763: Afternoon sir!
[5:48 pm, 20/11/2023] Shivjeet - Admission Officer: Greetings dear. How was your exams?
20/11/23, 5:37 pm - +260 96 2274763: I'll need some time to read this
20/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, may I know when you might be able to completely go through them?
20/11/23, 5:39 pm - +260 96 2274763: Okay
20/11/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know by when you might be able to complete it?
20/11/23, 6:04 pm - +260 96 2274763: I am done.
20/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Excuse me for the late reply. I am happy to hear that. In that case, shall we proceed with the session?
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, as much as I would like to continue with the session, my available hours are ending soon. Let's connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - +260 96 2274763: Okayy
20/11/23, 9:05 pm - +260 97 5963257: Yes thank you.  I guess Natasha needs to catch up with alot.  Tomorrow 12:30hrs can be fine
21/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied with a meeting with the team. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time to avoid any delay in your session so that you have free time to yourself. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
21/11/23, 1:49 pm - +260 96 2274763: We can proceed
21/11/23, 1:49 pm - +260 96 2274763: Good afternoon
21/11/23, 1:50 pm - +260 97 5963257: Good afternoon thank you
21/11/23, 2:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
21/11/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
21/11/23, 2:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/11/23, 2:05 pm - +260 96 2274763: Yes it does
21/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
21/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
21/11/23, 2:27 pm - +260 96 2274763: Yes you are
21/11/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 5963257: Yes you are clear
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
21/11/23, 2:34 pm - +260 97 5963257: So far clear on this one.
21/11/23, 2:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023*.
21/11/23, 2:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/11/23, 2:38 pm - +260 96 2274763: Yes please
21/11/23, 2:40 pm - +260 97 5963257: Please do
21/11/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/11/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/11/23, 2:53 pm - +260 97 5963257: Sir can't it be possible to give 3 instalments instead of 2 instalments?  we have said so as parents because of financial constraints.  Raising close to K10,000 (zambian currency) in weeks' time will not be possible on our side.  Please consider our plea.
21/11/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. I'd like to inform you that I've taken serious note of this and will discuss it further after our conversation regarding the letter. Shall we proceed with the session now?
21/11/23, 5:16 pm - +260 96 2274763: Sure
21/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 6:19 pm - +260 96 2274763: I am not fr Zimbabwe sir.
21/11/23, 6:19 pm - +260 96 2274763: I'm from Zambia
21/11/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
22/11/23, 11:02 am - +260 96 7857127 joined using this group's invite link
22/11/23, 6:01 pm - +260 96 2274763: Done.
22/11/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
22/11/23, 6:02 pm - +260 96 2274763: This isn’t for me to answer right?
22/11/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You can also answer this if you could please ask your parentsfor the same, dear."
22/11/23, 6:10 pm - +260 96 2274763: Okay, current they are both occupied with work.
22/11/23, 6:15 pm - +260 97 5963257: Sir can't it be possible to give 3 instalments instead of 2 instalments?  we have said so as parents because of financial constraints.  Raising close to K10,000 (zambian currency) in weeks' time will not be possible on our side.  Please consider our plea.
22/11/23, 6:15 pm - +260 97 5963257: This request has not been attended to👆🏻 the 2 instalments is too much from our end.  Pls respond so that we make an informed decision.
22/11/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. I'd like to inform you that I've taken serious note of this and will discuss it further after our conversation regarding the letter. Shall we proceed with the session now?
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Natasha. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

 I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - +260 96 2274763: Good afternoon
23/11/23, 1:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are ready to begin the session, please let me know, starting with the concerns that your mother has shared with us, dear. So, shall we?

23/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. Regarding your mother's concerns about the three installments, do you have any information about the deadlines she's considering for these payments?
23/11/23, 1:59 pm - +260 96 2274763: I do not.
23/11/23, 2:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's alright, dear. At any moment of the session, she can share the same. So, in the meantime, shall we proceed with the session?
23/11/23, 2:03 pm - +260 96 2274763: Yes
23/11/23, 2:07 pm - +260 97 5963257: Good afternoon Sir, our proposal is that 3 installments allowed we can pay for 1st one by 28th Nov. 2nd 28 Dec. And final 28th Jan.  Thank you in advance.
23/11/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Ideally, a student needs to make the payment of the university registration fee by the mentioned deadline as the seats are reserved for you and there are limited seats for this scholarship opportunity. I understand that you are facing financial challenges at the moment, and as your admission officer, I'll do my best to assist you with this.

Therefore, please allow until tomorrow to provide you with an update on your request. I'll have a detailed discussion with the academic board and get back to you with an answer. Please let me know if you agree to this?

24/11/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a reply from you and wanted to let you know that your request for installments on the payment has been approved by the university and the academic board under thorough consideration. Now, if you are available, could you please let me know so that we can proceed with the discussion of the remaining offer letter? Additionally, I have some beautiful insights about the university to share with you as well.
25/11/23, 7:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning parents and Natasha!

I hope you are having a fine morning today as it is the weekend. I was hoping for a response from your side the previous day so that we can complete our discussion for the offer letter details. You might have noticed that I have provided you with the approval of the installment plan you were seeking. I have also noticed that you were able to go through my message as well. So, if you are online, please do let me know so that we can complete this letter discussion on time.
25/11/23, 8:32 am - +260 97 5963257: Good morning thank you.  We appreciate the offer and accepting our payment plan.  However, we seem to be uncomfortable with the current university rankings in india.  If l recall very well during our chats you guided so well that you will able to provide choices about the universities and that we have to choose from those.  With that being said, we have decided to wait for other offers before we commit ourselves or to reserve a place.  @260962274763 can also comment on this.
25/11/23, 8:34 am - +260 96 2274763: Indeed. I previously asked for some insights on the university itself but I received no response. What I mean by insights is more information about the university.
25/11/23, 8:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am really happy that you were able to bring that up to me. I completely understand your concerns regarding the current university rankings in India and your decision to wait for other offers before making a commitment. Your comfort and confidence in the university you choose are crucial, and I'm here to assist you further in exploring other options that align better with your preferences.
25/11/23, 8:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your university scholarship application is based on merit systems. As of now, your application has been accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others.
25/11/23, 8:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter or the offer letter may come unsuccessful.

Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
25/11/23, 8:38 am - +260 96 2274763: Is it a problem if we do not pay for the current university?
25/11/23, 8:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, Natasha, this will be shared with you, I promise, as this is a major part of our discussion. sSaring this with you first will disrupt or flow of conversation with the letter. May I know if you are clear on this?
25/11/23, 8:39 am - +260 96 2274763: Yes I am.
25/11/23, 8:40 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges?
25/11/23, 8:40 am - +260 96 2274763: We aren’t just quite convinced about the university.
25/11/23, 8:45 am - +260 97 5963257: If you recall in our previous conversations l was very reluctant to make decision on behalf of our daughter because ultimately she is the who will take up this journey.  As such we have to be convinced that our daughter has made the right choice.  We understand that the payment has to be made accordingly.
25/11/23, 8:48 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and concerns regarding your daughter's choice and the university selection process. Your daughter's comfort and confidence in her chosen university are pivotal in making this important decision, and we completely understand and respect your stance.

It's commendable that you're ensuring your daughter feels confident about the university she selects for her academic journey. I want to assure you that we fully support her in making the right choice. To aid in your better understanding, would you like to proceed with the session? This way, I can share insights about university rankings and provide visual aids for your comprehension. Shall we proceed with the session for this purpose?
25/11/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 5963257: Yes pls
25/11/23, 8:49 am - +260 96 2274763: Yes we shall
25/11/23, 8:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask about the offer letter before I share the university insights with you ? <This message was edited>

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I would like to give you a gentle reminder that tomorrow marks the deadline for the first part of your university registration fees. The payment for this registration is crucial for you to secure your seat at this university with a 100% Scholarship on tuition fees and Accommodation fees. and the others to come are also secured by this payment. As your admission officer, I do not want you to lose out on this opportunity.  With that in mind, could you please update me on your current preparations regarding the payment for the first part of the registration fees?

This information will be helpful for me to update the university officials. Once provided, they'll anticipate the arrival of your next payment accordingly.
27/11/23, 5:19 pm - +260 96 2274763: Good evening sir.
27/11/23, 5:20 pm - +260 96 2274763: I hope you’re doing just fine and that you had a lovely weekend.
27/11/23, 5:22 pm - +260 96 2274763: I would like to share some sad news with you as well as the crew. Upon great consideration I have come to a decision that I would like to withdraw from the program. The mvn university seems like a nice university but I don’t visualize myself studying there.
27/11/23, 5:23 pm - +260 96 2274763: I am although grateful for the opportunity granted to me. Thank you very much.
27/11/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am having trouble to understand your decision to withdraw from the program at MVN University. Your comfort and satisfaction with your choice of university are crucial. May I ask what specifically led to this decision?
27/11/23, 5:26 pm - +260 96 2274763: I didn’t like the university.
27/11/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know what particular field that you were not interested in as the university has provided with 100% waiver on tuition fees and the accomodation fees.
27/11/23, 5:29 pm - +260 96 2274763: It was one of the least in terms of ranking when I searched for it.
27/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy that you were able to do research on the University. However, MVN University is recognized for providing quality education and is without any doubt better than the education standard of the University of Zambia. While perceptions can vary, I am certain that the facts are something we both can rely on. Hence, I want to ensure that you have accurate and detailed information.

Could you please share where it is mentioned that the quality of education at MVN University is not good? Additionally, if there are specific concerns or factors influencing this perception, it would be helpful to know. This information will enable me to address your concerns more effectively and provide you with the necessary details to make an informed decision. <This message was edited>

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reaching out to you to get an update on the admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you are supposed to make a payment of your registration fee by today, 28th November 2023. However, it has been a few days since we received any updates on your remaining registration formalities. This delay has hindered our ability to update the university on your scholarship status.
28/11/23, 3:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now?
