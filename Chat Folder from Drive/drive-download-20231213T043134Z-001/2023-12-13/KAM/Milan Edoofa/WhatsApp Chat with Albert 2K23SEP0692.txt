I hope this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, Admission Officer* at Edoofa. Along with Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admission), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction so that you can reap the most benefits from the Edoofa scholarship program.

This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
11/09/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Albert EWYL23E0665)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. However, you will be provided with a dedicated EWYL line as well, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups?
11/09/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes l  understand
11/09/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups. Moving forward, It's reassuring to hear that. I had a recent conversation with your counselor, Ms. Arshita during which she provided me with some insights into Albert's academic background and his career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in his achievements and be dedicated to ensuring he has access to the finest opportunities to launch his career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
11/09/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay thanks you ma’m

 So the whole process in itself it is an opportunity of a life time to be able to with  a scholarship overseas in country like India  which is highy recognized worldwide  on tertiary education and be able to attain the knowledge it is an honour to me and my family.  Mostly importantly in the fees  to be cut to $2000-$3000 from an average of $6000-$8000 that is truly breath taking and also the level of understanding that us as African people and our economic struggles to be able to  try and work to come out with a best possible solution.  So my favorite part is to be able to work so as to fund for my fees thereby cutting costs to my family through the use of EWYL program it is the best

12/09/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Very fine thank you
12/09/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know hear that.
12/09/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
12/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes we can
12/09/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
12/09/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
12/09/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
12/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay you can share
12/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
12/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
12/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
12/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
12/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
12/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
12/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 581 9582: I have watched the videos ma’m
12/09/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
12/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay . So the first video it is about who well other EDOOFIANS are doing and having joy to be part of journey and having the scholarship opportunity to study in India.  Also  it doesn’t always focus on excellent results but students who are willing to work ,to put more effort inorder to succed.  The second video  mainly emphasizes on following the instructions from our counsellor to avoid the situation of being scammed and giving the example of a student from Ghana who had paid $1000 but as for Edoofa it doesn’t encourage people to pay to someone else without their consent.  Third video emphasizes on the importance of institution that Edoofa tries to get for a student as there maybe so agents who mainly focuses on bring people to india and learning to institutions where there is low to no quality of education whereas Edoofa has a wide range  and connections to some of big institutions in India that will make sure a student gets quality education and also encourage hardwork and dedication as it is not by right to have this scholarship but has to be earned . 4th is guiding on the final process in attaining a position and document to  convince the institution to be enrolled . So basically a student has to lay out why they have to study program
12/09/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
12/09/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/09/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
12/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes thank you in helping to fully explain that
12/09/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
12/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay we can proceed .
12/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
12/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
12/09/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

12/09/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 581 9582: <Media omitted>

12/09/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Yes, please we can continue with our discussion now. Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
12/09/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
12/09/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a degree in the course Masters in Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the October 2023 intake?
12/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes that’s correct ma’m
12/09/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, however, let me inform you that the entire admission process will take 10 days if you are financially prepared. 

So I would like to have a confirmation from your side, that you are mentally and financially prepared for your admission fee and travel expenses from Zimbabwe to India, if you want an October 2023 intake?
12/09/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes  i am
12/09/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
12/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yeah we can start
12/09/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/09/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/09/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/09/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/09/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes it is practically impossible to study at multiple universities
12/09/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/09/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/09/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/09/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes ma’m Arshita had already informed me during our counseling sessions
12/09/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 581 9582: So the $2000- $3000 it includes the fee of $500-$750 of the registration is it . If so we can continue
12/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed you are absolutely correct. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
12/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay . If l may ask. 

 On food and accommodation can l be able to pay on semester basis not per anum and on tuition fee that can be pain whilst am in India is it correct
12/09/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263785819582, I would please like you to be patient here, as we move forward each and every detail will be covered in detail ahead, please.
12/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay ma’m. 

Am sorry for that .
12/09/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, so may I know if you have taken note of the above example of the fee breakup?
12/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes i did
12/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
12/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
12/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay l understand
12/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 581 9582: No l have no queries
12/09/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the process Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction we shall reconnect tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
12/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay thank you ma’m 

 Have a good night
12/09/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night.
13/09/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Afternoon ma’m Kirti .


  Its 13:00 our session has started
13/09/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Albert.

I hope you are doing well, Yes, please kindly excuse me for the delay, as it was our lunchtime, however, we can proceed now, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
13/09/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Its alright ma’m 

 Yes we can
13/09/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, before we move forward with our discussion regarding your admission process, may I know if you have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns you wish to share so far?
13/09/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Afternoon all
13/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, @263773880728 I hope you are doing well.
13/09/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Very
13/09/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 581 9582: No l dont
13/09/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is good to know all of us are on the same page. Now before moving on to the next step, I would want your parent to be actively present, so make sure @263773880728 is connected with us.
13/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay sure
13/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Yes I am connected
13/09/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process (enroll yourself at the university) and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.
13/09/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship.

The universities usually take a few days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due will be mentioned.
13/09/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is actually a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?
13/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes we are
13/09/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
13/09/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university.
13/09/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they cannot take admission into that particular university for the current academic year, the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
13/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yaah l understand
13/09/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
13/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 581 9582: We are clear
13/09/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, as you are aware your registration fee will be between $500 to $750, to be on the safer side, let us assume your registration fee is $750. Once you get your offer letter, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your registration fee of $750 to reserve/lock your scholarship seat.
13/09/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For example, if you get your offer letter on 01st March 2023 and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, which makes the deadline for your fee of $750 15th March 2023 and hence you would have to make the payment of your fee before then. Are you clear on this?

Please Note: *The above-mentioned dates are an example and we will discuss the actual dates further.*
13/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes I understand
13/09/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear here. Now, as per our conversation with the students and the parents who completed their admission process early, they shared that with the current economic situation in African countries, it gets a little tough for the parents to make the payment of the complete fee of $750 in one part and hence considering the same, we had a conversation with the academic board and the university officials and came up with a solution to help reduce the financial pressure on the registration fee. 

I hope you are excited to know about the solution we came up with?
13/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes l am
13/09/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, with respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee of $750 in two parts of $375 within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

However, Considering the urgency, you stated that you want to start with your university admission in October. In that case, we would have to fasten the process as a 45-day time span is a long time and after October we do not have any intakes for 2023. So I highly recommend having a thorough discussion with your family regarding the university registration process and the proposed due date of 25th September 2023. It is essential to ensure that everyone is aware of the time-sensitive nature of the situation. <This message was edited>
13/09/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, if you need more time to review your financial plans and determine when you'll be able to cover the registration fee, we’ll discuss that as well and we'll be happy to work with you to plan for your university admission accordingly.
13/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay it is clear
13/09/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. I believe you are satisfied with the discussion and are confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee due as per the tentative date shared which is *September 25th, 2023,*, so you can give us the (green light/go-ahead) to prepare Albert's scholarship application and send it to the universities recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
13/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes you can share
13/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263785819582 please, here we would need a go-ahead from your parents. So may I know if they are connected with us?

22/09/23, 10:30 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning *Parents and Albert*,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am *Ms. Vilsha, the Head of Admissions* at Edoofa.
22/09/23, 10:31 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I've been reviewing the recent conversation you had with Ms. Kirt over the past couple of days and couldn't help but notice a decrease in your activity within the admission group. It appears that something might be causing concern or hindrance for you and your family, which has led to this reduced engagement. <This message was edited>
22/09/23, 10:32 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to take a moment to reach out to you personally and inquire if there are any specific challenges or issues that may be restricting your ability to connect with our team effectively?
22/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Afternoon ma’m ma’m Vilsha 

 The main hindrance as of now is the the fees structure as my mother can not afford lets say the first $750 and then the $1000 that has to be paid within a week arriving  in India . Am sure if the amount has been a little lower am sure we would have made a significant progress. I have three other siblings that my mother has to cater for.
22/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Thank you so much Ms Vilsha how are you
22/09/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 388 0728: The major hinderance is money to pay for the 1015 needed  when he arrived in India
27/09/23, 4:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Albert

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. I have carefully reviewed the messages you shared and I completely understand the financial challenges you're facing. It's commendable that you're seeking a solution to make your academic journey possible.

I can imagine that the fees structure can be a significant burden, especially with three siblings to care for. Your concern about the costs is entirely valid, and I want to assure you that I am personally committed to assisting you in the coming days to address this challenge and work together toward a solution.
27/09/23, 4:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: At the same time, I would also like to extend my apologies. The past few days, I was unexpectedly tied up in meetings related to the arrival of students, which prevented me from checking your message and connecting with you. To provide some insight into what occupied my time yesterday, I'd like to share an overview of the same and help you with the arrival picture from the airport.

With that being said, could you kindly let me know at what time you would like to reconnect with us today? This information will allow me to ensure that we can reconnect at the agreed-upon time.
27/09/23, 4:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Afternoon Vilsha.
27/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 581 9582: This is great news  a win for  all of us  as we try to change the lives of the next generation through your hardwork .  Congratulations keep up with the good work .
27/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Its okay.  Am available  if possible now we can start our session .
27/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Thank you so much for the concern iam humbled by the continuous checking on the way forward keep the caring spirit
27/09/23, 4:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, thank you for providing your availability, and I am pleased that you're ready to begin our discussion. Before we delve into addressing your specific questions, I would like to gain a clear understanding of your educational plans in light of the financial challenges.

As parents and a family, do you intend to pursue academic studies in India for the August 2023 intake, with the aim of arriving no later than October of this year? Alternatively, are you considering joining the next academic intake in August 2024, intending to commence your education at that time?

Once we've established your preferred timeline, we can work together to find suitable solutions to address the challenges you are currently facing. Your decision regarding the intake will guide us in developing a tailored plan moving forward.
27/09/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 581 9582: August 2023   Will be best .
27/09/23, 5:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I see, @263785819582. In that case, if I understand correctly, you are planning to proceed with your university admission for the August 2023 intake and intend to arrange for your arrival next month, which is October 2023, correct?
27/09/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes thats correct .
27/09/23, 6:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for confirming your understanding, @263785819582. Now, to assist you in addressing the financial challenges associated with the upcoming expenses, I would like to gain a better understanding of the financial planning you have put in place for your higher education and your arrival in India in October 2023. Could you please provide details on your plans and budget for the following anticipated expenses?

1. **University Registration Fee ($750)**
   
2. **First Semester Tuition and Accommodation Fee**

3. **Visa and Flight Expenses**
27/09/23, 6:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Having a clear picture of your financial plans for these specific costs will enable us to explore potential strategies to ensure a smooth transition for your education and travel arrangements. Your transparency in this matter is greatly appreciated, and it will allow us to work together effectively to address any financial challenges that may arise.
27/09/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Currently we have $500 in hand as the rest was spread out  to my siblings. But l am willing to do anything so as to pursue  my studies. I even went to Midlands State University so as to gather more information about the MBA and its modules .
28/09/23, 8:03 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I completely understand your situation, @263785819582. Your determination to pursue a Master's degree is admirable, and it's clear that you're committed to achieving your educational goals.
28/09/23, 8:03 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Considering that you currently have $500 for your education expenses, I'm curious to learn more about your plans for covering the remaining costs required for your admission and higher education. Could you share your strategies or potential sources for reaching your desired budget?
28/09/23, 8:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: At the same time, while I admire your intent to explore alternate options for your education in Zimbabwe, I hope you are well aware of the importance of choosing the right school for your MBA. It's a highly demanded course, and the choice of institution can significantly impact your career prospects. 

While Zimbabwean universities may offer cost-effective admission options, it's crucial to consider whether they provide the ideal environment for you to excel in your studies and future career. The investment you make in your education should align with your long-term goals and aspirations.

Ultimately, selecting the right school can define how your career unfolds, making it essential to thoroughly research and choose wisely.
28/09/23, 6:27 pm - +263 77 388 0728: Afternoon Vilsha . 


 I don't intend to pursue my education here in Zimbabwe as l have committed myself to learn in India as it is the best step to continue my education in India . That is the only option l have . Am sure the required amount for registration l will have to ask my relatives if they can chip in . Edoofa is the right platform for me  to continue with my education. Thank you for your continued support ,effort and  time  that you are putting in for us to find the solution. If l arrive in India l will try to find part time jobs as a care assistant since l have acquired the  the certificates to try to raise money for my tution ..

 Thank you
29/09/23, 5:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to you as well Albert, and I appreciate you for sharing your determined commitment to pursuing your education in India. I can see that you believe that this decision is the best path for your academic journey, and I appreciate your confidence in Edoofa as the right platform for your education.
29/09/23, 5:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I completely understand that seeking assistance from your relatives for the registration fee and other educational costs may be necessary and that is perfectly fine. 

Your dedication and resourcefulness, such as considering part-time work as a care assistant upon arriving in India, serve as a great source of motivation for us and that is the reason, we are committed to working closely with you to navigate the challenges you face and provide effective solutions.
29/09/23, 5:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: On that note, I would like to inquire if you and your family have established a budget for the expenses you are prepared to contribute towards your annual tuition fee, accommodation, food, and other basic necessities. Could you please share the budget you have in place for these expenses? 

This information will be valuable in ensuring we align your educational plans with your financial resources effectively.
29/09/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Good day  

 Upon my arrival i can try to work  to fund for my  basic necessities whilist my mother tries to raise the remaining tution fee in which in 3 months time she assured me that she will be able to raise the money  as for now she is a bit off . This is due to my other siblings as they are also going to boarding school so after 3 months she will be settled and be able to pay  the remaining amount
30/09/23, 3:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, and I appreciate you sharing this insight with me, Albert. Based on what you mentioned, it seems like you and your family would require a minimum of three months to adequately prepare for your educational expenses, considering the current timeline.

Given this situation and the fact that you are already lagging behind the academic intake while also facing unexpected financial expenses, have you considered the option of planning for the 2024 intake? This would allow you to complete your admission journey and secure your scholarship this year, giving you more time to prepare for your arrival next year.
30/09/23, 3:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Choosing the 2024 intake might align better with your financial and academic goals, ensuring that you are well-prepared and can make the most of your educational opportunity without rushing the process. What are your thoughts on this alternative timeline?
30/09/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Honestly to be waiting for another year  l will be on the same position as 2024 will only but make it worse on my financial situation.Is there a way possible  that we can work this through or a timeline that l am expected to raise that tution fee that is not in the firs week of my arrival in India .
11/10/23, 6:41 am - +263 78 581 9582: Morning team . 

 I totally understand 

 Am available today at 2 pm
11/10/23, 7:46 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation, Albert, 2:00 PM in the afternoon works perfectly for our discussion. I will mark that down, and we will connect at that time. Please feel free to prepare any questions you would like to discuss regarding your university admission letter or any other aspects of your higher education. 

Looking forward to our conversation at 02:00 in the afternoon!
11/10/23, 7:51 am - +263 78 581 9582: Okay   Thank you . 

Looking forward to our discussion .
11/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Afternoon team . Its 2:00 l think our session has started
11/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Thank you so much for the effort in making sure that l can pursue my education and you are trying in all possible way to make sure l arrive there in India .  As for now  we can afford the registration fee and the flight tickets then the rest will be spread up until the end of year everything will be paid in full.
11/10/23, 10:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, Albert, and to continue the same thought, it is evident that you are well-prepared to cover the immediate expenses required for your university admission, which encompass the registration fee typically ranging from $500 to $750, as well as the expenses associated with your visa and flight.
11/10/23, 10:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given your readiness, I wanted to reiterate and confirm your family's plan for your arrival in India within this month. Are you in a position to complete the necessary formalities within this stipulated timeframe?
11/10/23, 10:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: If your answer is affirmative, we can proceed with securing your spot for the 2023 academic intake. However, if the timeline is a concern, since we are already three months behind the admission schedule, it may not be feasible to join the August 2023 intake. I am now interested in hearing your thoughts, and finalizing the way forward.
12/10/23, 7:00 am - +263 78 581 9582: Morning Vilsha and team 
Yes  l am willing to start this semester . Since right now we are at the middle of the month  end of November  we will be able to  settle the remaining .
12/10/23, 7:52 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I did not quite understand your message well. Could you please elaborate on the timelines you have in mind? Are you planning to complete your admission formalities and arrange your arrival in India this month? With this, I believe what you are saying is that you will be able to clear your fees by the end of next month?

Also, good morning to you and your family Albert, thank you for your greetings.
12/10/23, 7:56 am - +263 78 581 9582: Yes  l am . l will be able to clear my fees end of next month  thats correct
12/10/23, 8:18 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this plan with me. Rest assured, we are here to help you with this plan and provide assistance as needed for your higher education goals. However, there is a specific concern to consider. According to the university's policies, students are required to settle their first-semester fees within three days of their arrival in order to facilitate the FRRO process. Are you familiar with what the FRRO process entails?
12/10/23, 8:24 am - +263 78 581 9582: Yes l am .
12/10/23, 8:36 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad you're aware of the importance of the FRRO process, Albert. Meeting the fee payment requirement within the first three days of arrival is crucial for a smooth FRRO process. Any delay beyond 14 days may result in fines for students. Since you've been forthcoming about your situation, our aim is to ensure you are well-prepared and avoid any such complications.
12/10/23, 8:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: To assist you, we can arrange for a partial payment of your first-semester fee, which would be approximately $100 to $150, upon your arrival in India. This can cover your FRRO process, and the remaining fee can be paid by the end of November. How does this solution align with your family's plans for your admission to the 2023 batch?
12/10/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 581 9582: Am sure we can be able to work with that. And be able to achieve my life long dream. Cant wait to get started .
12/10/23, 8:55 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Absolutely, Albert. Now that we are aligned on the steps you need to take, we will move forward to help you obtain an offer letter for your higher education as quickly as possible. Once we secure it, we will inform you and reconnect with you within your admission group.

In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to bring them up and share them with us here. Rest assured, we are here to assist you every step of the way.
17/10/23, 9:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Albert,

I hope you all are doing well, and I find you in the best of spirits. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application at the universities in India.
17/10/23, 9:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With all the efforts we have invested, I am thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
17/10/23, 9:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, as we received it early, we wanted to share it with you early and get a head start on our discussions. Please take your time to thoroughly review the letter, and then we will discuss its contents in detail.
17/10/23, 9:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the meantime, I would encourage you to note down any queries or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. When we reconnect to discuss this letter, having your questions prepared will help ensure a productive discussion. Once you have taken note of this letter, please let me know so that we can schedule our next discussion accordingly. Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
17/10/23, 9:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Evening Vilsha  we are doing great  and yourself and the rest of the team. 

 Thank you for making this happen . Isnt it possible for me to start this year if so we can be able to  pay for the registration fee . As l want to start my education this year .
17/10/23, 9:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you for asking, Albert. I want to reassure you that the offer letter that has been issued will indeed allow you to join the academic intake of August 2023, and we will proceed with your application as per our previous discussion.

However, as discussed early on in our discussions, it's also important to note that the universities have already closed the 2023 admissions, and the offer letters are generated by a system. Therefore, the offer letter reflects the format of 2024 students, as it is not feasible to make specific changes in the system that generates these letters. As a result, the date of commencement mentioned in the letter is September 2024.

I hope this clarifies the concern you had?
17/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 581 9582: For clarification if we continue with the payment then I will be able to start my education in 2023 is that right
17/10/23, 9:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, that is correct Albert.
17/10/23, 9:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To ensure we can discuss the offer letter and address any questions or concerns you may have, could you kindly let me know if you'll be available to connect tomorrow evening at 07:30 PM? This would provide us with ample time to have a detailed conversation and guide you on the next steps you are to undertake to complete your admission formalities.
17/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes that will do  . I will be there .
17/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Thank you .
17/10/23, 9:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That sounds great, Albert. Let us plan to reconnect tomorrow at 7:30 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion and will be fully prepared to assist you. During our tomorrow's meeting, we will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete your university admission formalities.

For now, let's bring our conversation to a close for today. I wish you a blessed evening ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
17/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Same to you ,Thank you  so much for making this happen . Cant wait for tomorrow   . Will definitely do that .
18/10/23, 7:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Albert,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 7:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Evening Vilsha .  Thanks again . Yes l had the opportunity to go through the  offer letter .
18/10/23, 7:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Albert. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 7:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay  we can continue with our discussion
18/10/23, 7:52 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 7:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 581 9582: 1)  $1000

2) 2 years . With 4 semesters 

3) $300

4) $1000
18/10/23, 8:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a two-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling four semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, his tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means his annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000 * 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes
18/10/23, 8:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased that we have been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/10/23, 8:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/10/23, 8:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes l understand
18/10/23, 8:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. 

Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
18/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes it does
18/10/23, 8:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes we can
18/10/23, 8:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and as a special benefit for the Edoofians. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/10/23, 8:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes we are together
18/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay l understand
18/10/23, 8:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Albert. Now that we are clear with the payment due date, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 8:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 581 9582: No in Gweru
18/10/23, 9:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 9:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 9:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay. Will make a plan so as to give him
18/10/23, 9:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely Albert. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/10/23, 9:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 581 9582: I think Mr Charles will be more feasible as it narrows down the expense if traveling to harare .
18/10/23, 9:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely, Albert, that would be fine as well. If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay. Noted .
18/10/23, 10:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Albert, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2,000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2,000 + $200 + $800 = $3,000
20/10/23, 10:21 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Albert,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. In our conversation on Wednesday, we were in the midst of addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission and the scholarship offer letter from Galgotias University.

However, halfway through our discussion, we did not receive a response from your end, and consequently, I have been expecting a reply from you. Could you please confirm if you had the opportunity to go through my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
20/10/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 581 9582: Morning  Vilsha  yes we went through the last message  and after  discussion my family cannot raise 3000 all at once had it been a payment method am sure we can work on that .
20/10/23, 11:30 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are connected and to hear that you went through the last message and discussed it with your family. I understand that raising $3000 all at once can be challenging. However, I would like to clarify that you don't have to pay the entire fee at once. The fee can be paid in parts as well. 

I can see the concerns you have, and they are natural. But keep in mind that we were in the midst of our conversation the other day. Until we cover all the details, such assumptions are only natural for you. However, if you don't share your concerns and instead take some time off, you may not get the clarity you need in a timely manner. It's essential to have a clear understanding of the entire process before making decisions. I hope you are able share my sentiments?
20/10/23, 11:44 am - +263 78 581 9582: I apologize for that  . I hope to rectify this and be able to share my sentiments
20/10/23, 8:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same sentiments @263785819582. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $3000, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
20/10/23, 8:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/10/23, 8:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
20/10/23, 8:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
21/10/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 581 9582: Morning Vilsha 

This is clear  the EWYL program .
26/10/23, 8:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Albert,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the message you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications.

However, it is good to reconnect with you today and have the opportunity to continue with our discussion regarding your university admission and arrival plans.

Hence, I would like to enquire if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before we proceed?

If not, I would like to know your plans for making the payment of your university registration fee, especially since the university has set a deadline for tomorrow, October 31, 2023. Have you decided on the payment method and date so that we can update the university officials and provide confirmation?

30/10/23, 6:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That sounds good, Albert. Keeping your mother informed and reminding her about the deadline is a responsible step.

 It is with my deepest regret that the payment was made l tried to get in touch with my mother n family members that said they were going to help me pay my fees  but its to no avail . Noone is responding to my text .  As of now l dont know what to do .
03/11/23, 12:59 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Albert,

I would like to extend my appreciation for your patience. I was occupied in a series of meetings with the university officials as we were concluding the admissions for the month of October. Unfortunately, this kept me from being available to connect with you.
03/11/23, 1:00 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that you and your family are in good health. I have reviewed your previous message concerning your registration fee, and I want to assure you that we are here to assist you. I am truly sorry to hear about the challenges you are facing, and I understand your frustration. It can be difficult when you're in a situation where you're depending on others for financial support, and they are not responding.
03/11/23, 1:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Given that it has been two days and we've missed the due date set by the university, I would like to check if you've been able to successfully connect with your family members to gain insights into their perspective on the situation. Were there any particular challenges they were facing that hindered communication, and what did they suggest as a way forward for your higher education?
03/11/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 581 9582: Morning Vilsha 

Thank you for  getting in toita and still having the patience to continue to help me achieve my dream

So l am hoping that he will accept my offer and be able to assist me for my education as l see it as opportunity to start my life in a right direction .

I trust you're all doing well.

I'm Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. Now, I was going through your application file and I saw that it's been some time since our last communication.

17/11/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, I was going through your discussion with Ms. Vilsha and I noticed that you were not able to complete your admission process due to the reason that you were not able to get timely response from your mother as well as your uncle, right?
18/11/23, 7:43 am - +263 78 581 9582: Morning Milan

23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Albbert!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes we are ready for that .
23/11/23, 7:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. How have you been doing?
23/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Am doing well and yourself
23/11/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am doing fine too, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, earlier when we had a discussion, your parents had mentioned that they are planning to pay the first part of your registration fee by 24th November, i.e. Tomorrow, hence, if I may ask, how are your preaparations for the same?
23/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Am sure she will be able to do it if everything goes well
23/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Can l ask if she is able to finish  the  the registration fee  will l be  to start my education this current year
23/11/23, 8:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask, are you willing to start with your university education now? <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes if possible the first of December  if eve goes well
23/11/23, 8:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that since the universities have closed this year's intake already, I believe it won't be possible for you to do that. However, I will check with the university officials once and then I will let you know of that please. 

But before that, since it is important for you to complete the admission process first to be able to come to India, in that case are you certain that you would be able to pay the full fee in this month itself?
23/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes am sure on the 30th of this month we would have completed the total registration fee
23/11/23, 8:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Thank you for letting me know of that please. Moving ahead, in order for us to work with this payment, you would have to write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you are planning to make the payment of $600 by 30th November and clear the whole fee and asking that if you plan to do that, would you still be able to secure the scholarship seat along with the Endowment Plan Benefits. I hope this is understood?
23/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay let me send the email .
23/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 78 581 9582: I have sent the email
23/11/23, 9:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Let me inform the academic board officials and ask them to check the same. And once you will receive a revert from them, we will then proceed with the next steps please.
23/11/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Okay  thank you
27/11/23, 6:39 am - +263 78 581 9582: Morning Mr Milan  l hope you had a great weekend . 

 I wanted to know if  my my email was approved and if l may proceed with the payment until 30 November .
28/11/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Albert!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 10:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for connecting with me here dear. On that note, I would like to mention the request that you had shared with the academic board to extend your deadline was approved. However, I would like to add another thing to this that, here I have mentioned the fee as $600 please, and that was due to a clerical error. Now, you would have to pay the complete $750 registration fee by 30th November in order to complete your admission. I hope this is understood?
28/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 581 9582: Yes it is understood
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, now since you have cleared the confusion that you had, may I know how is it that you wish to proceed with Albert's admission process?
29/11/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Albert!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Following our last conversation, I had informed the academic board that you would be sharing the mail with them shortly, and they were waiting for your email regarding the confirmation of the payment plan as well as the date of making the payment. However, as it wasn't sent in a timely manner and considering the imminent closure for the current round of applications that will be taking place by tomorrow, I personally took the initiative to have a conversation with the team and university officials on your behalf.

After presenting strong cases and emphasizing the challenges you've encountered, they empathized with your situation. Understanding the circumstances, they have kindly granted an extension for the payment deadline up till 30th November. Hence, it's imperative to proceed with making the payment before the stipulated date.
29/11/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: This extension was secured by showcasing our dedication and efforts on your behalf. It's essential to exhibit our goodwill and ensure that the commitment made on your behalf is upheld.

Please proceed with the payment as agreed upon before the extended deadline. Should you encounter any difficulties or need further assistance, feel free to connect with me at your earliest convenience.
