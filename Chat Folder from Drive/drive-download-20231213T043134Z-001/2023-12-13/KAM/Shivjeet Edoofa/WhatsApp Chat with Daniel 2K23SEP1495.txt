For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/09/23, 9:37 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Thank you
27/09/23, 9:37 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yes we can start
27/09/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 9:39 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: I am done
27/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
27/09/23, 9:48 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah they are
27/09/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/09/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/09/23, 9:49 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yes I am following
27/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/09/23, 9:54 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah I get them clearly
27/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/09/23, 9:57 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah that would be good
27/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/09/23, 10:02 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah
Share the videos please
27/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

27/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

27/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
27/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to schedule our session for Friday at 8:30 PM. I hope by that time you might be able to watch the videos. Have a great night.
27/09/23, 10:10 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Good night to you too
29/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Daniel

29/09/23, 8:28 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to see that. So may I know if you might be able to give me a brief understanding about the four videos with me?
29/09/23, 9:19 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: The first videos is like an introduction of edoofa and why they came about with the idea of edoofa where they are also talking more about the qualities of a student where they are saying us(students) must be open minded and we must follow instructions in order to be succesfull with the program..

In the second video,they are high lighting more on a succesfull student,and they are saying that edoofa will help us to increase our capacity o f success thus helping us being independent in our daily lives.

In the  third video they are telling us how much effort they gave to identify universities that will help  edoofians to fulfill they dreams by being succesfull and for edoofians to make it to these institutions they have to apply more effort and understanding the instructions and following them in order to make it or being qualified to the institutions..

In the last video they are talking more about the essentials of the statement of purpose (SOP) and how this part is serious that it help secure ones scholarship and we have to take extra care when filling out the form..

Thats the information I have gathered from the videos
29/09/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
29/09/23, 9:58 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah we are
29/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
29/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tuesday 5:00 PM.
29/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

03/10/23, 5:15 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: 2.THE MERCHANIZM OF CAVITATION IN PIPES AND DRAINS 

To begin with,cavitavtion refers to the accumulation or formation of air bubbles in a fluid where there is low pressure condition which is lower than the pressure of vapor which is in equilibrium with its liquid e.g as steam with water,and this is known as *Saturation pressure*.

In additionto that,dissolved gases are released from the fluid as the fluid pressure is less than saturation pressure,as time goes these air bubbles will suddenly collapse once the flow enters into a  region of higher pressure.As a result,high dynamic pressure is produced and this causes damage to the pipelines due to its high frequency.

*Cavitation* in pipes is avoided in many ways and some of them are as follows:
-One must find a way to reduce   the length of piping sections where possible
-If one is welding sections of pipes together,he or she must ensure that the weld surface inside the pipe is not too thick.
•Other ways include,adding an inducer to the pump inlet,minimizing upstream flow losses and many more
03/10/23, 5:15 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: 3. SOIL REINFORCEMENT AND ITS IMPORTANCE

Firstly,when engineers want to build on a land consisting weak soil they use mechanical ways to stabilize the weak soils and it mostly involve the fibrous materials.For example,*Geocomposite* is used,this material is a combination of a drainage or barrier material with a filter called *Geotextile* which prevents soil to move into the drainage system.

If a building collapses there are many causes that led to that disaster.Foundation failure is one of the cause of building collapse,evaporation and transpiration are some causing agents of foundation failure,this cause affected the construction of the *Tower of pisa*.Other causes include,Bad design,differential settlement etc and some of these causes can be avoided by soil reinforcement and that is why soil reinforcement is important when building on weak soils to avoid some disasters.

There are several advantages of Soil reinforcement,these include:
-Reduces soil erosion in marshy lands and river boundary sand,this was one well known advantage why people used soil  reinforcement in the past.
-Nowadays,it is mostly applied in construction sites where there is weak soils.
03/10/23, 5:16 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: 4.MIVAN CONSTRUCTION METHOD AND ITS USAGE IN BUILDING PROJECTS TODAY

To begin with,Mivan is a quality aluminium structure and it was developed by a construction company based in europe which is well known as *Mivan company ltd*.In the 1990's the company started manufacturing these formwork systems and they were used for constructing houses in large quantities at a faster speed thus more buildings were being built in a short period of time.Mivan construction technology is also known as *Mivan shuttering*

Mivan construction has been actively replacing traditional formwork systems which mostly use timber plywood e.t.c.Nowadays,in most countries or states they are now using Mivan technology as it is more advanced.For instance,in India the most popular example of its use was in Government Housing for all by 2022 scheme,where they used mivan technology to build structures.

There are many ways in which Mivan Shuttering is used when building projects today.For example,slabs and walls are easily formed in one consistent development,they are also used in assembling and fitting the part of shuttering and they are easy to operate.

This technology is beneficial in many ways as it requires less labour,reduces time and cost,good quality construction work e.t.c
03/10/23, 5:16 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: 5.PREFABRICATED STRUCTURES AND ITS USAGE IN LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS 

*Prefabricated structures* or building are buildings with components (roof,wall and floor( that are manufactured in a factory or manufacturing plant.Components manufactured in the factories can be fully or partially assembled in a factory,then transfered to the construction site.It is at the site where the main building is completed and buildings built in this way are called *Prefabs* 

These structures  are also used in large  infrastructures.For example,steel and glass sections are widely used for the exterior of large buildings.They are also used in foundations of large infrastructures since they are strong and reliable.

They are very beneficial because they are reusable.This simply means the same component can be used at a certain building and can be removed to build another structure in the future.This also helps in protecting the enviroment.It also reduces the money   spent when building another building because the same items from the previous building can be used again.

25/10/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As there has been a delay regarding our session for your admission process due to the recent inactivity, and it's alright. Due to this reason, we would be moving a little backward a few days for your EWYL session with your mentor, which is on the 31st  of October. So, I would like you to kindly correct the form in your orientation session availability date as the 31st of October so that we will be able to schedule a session for your mentor and share the same with them. May I know by when you might be available for that?
25/10/23, 6:43 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Okay I will correct the date.we can start tommorow
25/10/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know if you still wanted to proceed with the session or wanted to schedule tomorrow?
25/10/23, 7:00 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: We can continue today.As we have lost a lot of time
25/10/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/10/23, 7:02 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yes it is correct
25/10/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
25/10/23, 7:09 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah I an ready
25/10/23, 7:39 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: am*
25/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
'
25/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/10/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/10/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/10/23, 8:02 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah that's true
25/10/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/10/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/10/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/10/23, 8:44 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah he explained this very well
25/10/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/10/23, 8:46 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah I understand
25/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
25/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum
25/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/10/23, 9:00 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah I get the point
25/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Sure, here's an easy explanation:

You have to pay for your education and other costs at a school. Here's what you need to pay:

Tuition Fee: This is the cost for your classes, and it's $350 for a whole year.
Accommodation Fee: You don't have to pay for this because someone else is covering it completely. So, it's $0 for the year.
Miscellaneous Fee: This is for other things you'll need during the year, and it's $1000.
Registration Fee: You have to pay this within two weeks, and it's $1000.
To find the total cost for the year, you add up all these fees:

Tuition Fee ($350) + Accommodation Fee ($0) + Miscellaneous Fee ($1000) = Total Fee ($1350) for the year.
26/10/23, 5:35 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: I understand
26/10/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope your day is off to a great start. I am fully prepared to embark on your session, and I'd like to emphasize that I'll also be at your service in the evening at 7:30 PM. If you're ready to begin now, let's dive into the session and make the most of it.
26/10/23, 6:03 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Good evening
26/10/23, 6:04 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah we can begin
26/10/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
26/10/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000 = $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
26/10/23, 6:14 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Okay that's good
But I have a question.What is the rate  of being selected by a university?
26/10/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The rate of being accepted by a university is 100% as you are an Edoofian, and you are guaranteed offer letters with scholarships from the universities. May I know if you are clear here?"
26/10/23, 6:17 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah I was wondering.
26/10/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are clear so that we can move ahead with the session?
26/10/23, 6:19 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: But now I understand
26/10/23, 6:20 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah I get it
26/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
26/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
26/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 6:24 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: How much is the visa as of now?
26/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The VISA fee amounts to $83 and must be submitted directly to the embassy by either the student, parent, or guardian. It's worth noting that this visa fee is a one-time payment and remains valid throughout your entire higher education journey in India. This falls within the scope of additional expenses that you'll be responsible for. I hope we are on the same page here?
26/10/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected? @265999198191
26/10/23, 7:54 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah we are
26/10/23, 7:54 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: My bundle was done so I had to go and buy credit form the nearest shop.I just arrived home now.
26/10/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know if you are comfortable to proceed with the session now?
26/10/23, 8:02 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: This message was deleted
26/10/23, 8:02 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah let's proceed**
26/10/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/10/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
26/10/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
26/10/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 8:15 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Thank you
26/10/23, 8:17 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Awesome
26/10/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/10/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/10/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
26/10/23, 8:33 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: I am ready
26/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
26/10/23, 8:42 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah I have noted.It would be good to discuss them
26/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/10/23, 8:43 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: That's good
26/10/23, 8:43 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Can you explain thus referred to MSCE please
26/10/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed, it is related to MSCE. Let me help you get this clear: A level mentioned here is the same as MSCE, and the O level here is the same as JCE. May I know if you are clear here?
26/10/23, 8:46 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Okay okay
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 9:16 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah I understand it
26/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 9:17 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: I also get this one as well
26/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/10/23, 9:21 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: It is well explained 
I understand
26/10/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/10/23, 6:03 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Okay looking forward to do as told
27/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I will not be able to continue our conversation when you were online, as we are approaching the weekend, we are limited by our time.

For further continuation with sufficient time and productivity, I will be available from 3:00 PM on the coming Monday, which is the 30th of October, to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, as we can do that too. Thank you for your understanding, and please do enjoy your weekend.
30/10/23, 7:02 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Good evening
30/10/23, 7:03 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms.Saloni and she hasn't scheduled my session yet.
30/10/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know the name of your mentor. If you are ready now shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
30/10/23, 7:09 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah we can proceed
30/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/10/23, 7:32 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Can you explain it just in summary?
30/10/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
30/10/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
30/10/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
30/10/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
30/10/23, 7:42 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah I can spot the difference.Thank you
30/10/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
30/10/23, 7:58 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah I agree
30/10/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/10/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/11/23, 6:32 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Good evening
02/11/23, 12:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear Parents and Daniel.

I hope that you are doing well and blessed. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as I was on a leave on account of my birthday.

That said, I'm now active and ready to take on your session. I would also like to inform you that I will be available in the evening as well, from 5:00 PM, in case you are currently occupied. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.
02/11/23, 8:09 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Good evening
02/11/23, 8:09 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: A late happy birthday to you I guess.Hope you enjoyed your birthday
02/11/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, I did enjoyed it. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
02/11/23, 8:55 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah we can proceed
02/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
02/11/23, 8:57 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah I can recall 
We can proceed
02/11/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
02/11/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
02/11/23, 9:19 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Yeah I understand
02/11/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
02/11/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
02/11/23, 9:26 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Let's proceed
02/11/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month.

14/11/23, 2:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Dear parents and Daniel !

I hope you are well and blessed. I was not able to respond to your message when you were online, as it was a long weekend here in India, followed by a national holiday—Diwali, also known as the festival of lights. With that said, I was going through the documents noticed that you have not yet shared me with the JCE document and the ID of the student.
14/11/23, 6:13 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Good evening
14/11/23, 6:13 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: What ID?
14/11/23, 6:14 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: I went to collect my JCE  certificate today but they are not available yet.They said maybe I should go another day just to check the grade list
14/11/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was referring to the *Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
14/11/23, 6:40 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: I thought I already shared it??
14/11/23, 6:40 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to recieve it on my end, could you please share it with me again?
14/11/23, 6:42 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 6:42 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: That's it
14/11/23, 6:45 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: So can the letter be sent to universities without the jce documents?
Because I doubt if I will get the certificate because here in Malawi they don't consider JCE useful.It will be hard and will take long to get the JCE documents
14/11/23, 6:46 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: I hope you get what I'm trying to say
14/11/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, I can understand you. It will be an essential document for us to proceed with the application for your scholarship program.
14/11/23, 6:55 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: I understand 
But as I said they don't consider it usefull and that's why the JCE documents are rarely distributed in schools by the government
14/11/23, 6:55 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: I will try my best to get the grades but it is nearly impossible to get the certificate
14/11/23, 6:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: hank you for sharing that information. I understand that obtaining the JCE documents might be challenging. In such cases, it's crucial to do your best to retrieve the documents.
14/11/23, 6:57 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: I will try my best to get them
14/11/23, 6:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I shall wait for the same.
14/11/23, 7:00 pm - +265 999 19 81 91: Thank you
27/11/23, 4:31 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Hello
27/11/23, 4:46 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Can you send your email please  so that you should get the JCE document through your email .
27/11/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Daniel
27/11/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Quest Group of Institutions* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
27/11/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
27/11/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
27/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 9:33 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Thanks
It is good to hear from you 
The time is good we can communicate at that time no any problems.
28/11/23, 12:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Daniel,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 12:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1200.
28/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, there is a $100 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your uniform fee, library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $100 to the per annum tuition fee of $1200, the total comes out to be $1300.
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Oh Oky
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $500 per anum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1200  + $500 = $1700. I hope you are clear about this?
28/11/23, 2:20 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah I am
28/11/23, 2:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/11/23, 2:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/11/23, 2:27 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah I am clear
28/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1700 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1700 - $1000 = $700 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/11/23, 2:44 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah I see
28/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the registration fee of $750 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year's tuition fee, therefore the amount of tuition fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1200 - $750 = $450. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
28/11/23, 2:51 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah I understand
28/11/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 12, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
28/11/23, 2:58 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: But I thought you said it was 30 days👀
28/11/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy that you remembered. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah
28/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 12, 2023,* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 12, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
28/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 12th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
28/11/23, 4:32 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah we are
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

May I know in which country are you residing?
28/11/23, 4:37 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Malawi
28/11/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update with me. Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
30/11/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Daniel!

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping for a response from your side the previous day so that we can complete our discussion for the offer letter details. My sole aim in this quest is not just to secure the offer letter but to ensure a sturdy foundation for your aspirations, carving a path for a brighter future abroad. Your dreams are the compass; let's steer them toward reality together. So if you are ready shall we proceed?
30/11/23, 3:53 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah
30/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you might be able to give me a reply on my above message?
30/11/23, 3:58 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: I haven’t asked my parents yet 
But they will answer once they read it
30/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly Daniel, May I know by when they might be able to give you a reply regarding this?
30/11/23, 4:09 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Today
30/11/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I shall wait for the same.
30/11/23, 4:11 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Oky thank you
30/11/23, 6:03 pm - +265 999 65 33 43: Sorry, for not responding quickly. Payment will be done in 2 installments. First payment any day before 12 Dec 23 and last payment before 12 Jan 24 as you clearly stated in yr discussion. Thanks
30/11/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I was requesting on the mode of payment that you wish to pay. <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Daniel. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was hoping we could proceed with our letter discussion in due time as planned previously. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
01/12/23, 2:43 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Noh
01/12/23, 2:43 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: I am around
01/12/23, 2:44 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Only that the network connection is very slow
01/12/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, I understand that network can be challenging some times. So may I know if we are ready to proceed with the session?
01/12/23, 2:55 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Yeah we can proceed
01/12/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
01/12/23, 2:58 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Oky
01/12/23, 2:59 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: I thought u said there will be a number of universities and I will have to choose one??
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct. Your university scholarship application is based on merit systems. As of now, your application has been accepted by the Quest Group of Institutions and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others.
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter or the offer letter may come unsuccessful.
01/12/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
01/12/23, 3:02 pm - +265 997 14 22 75: Oky 
Thanks for the information
01/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In that case, let me also tell you a bit about the Quest Group of institutions.

They have more than 200 International students from more than 15 different countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
