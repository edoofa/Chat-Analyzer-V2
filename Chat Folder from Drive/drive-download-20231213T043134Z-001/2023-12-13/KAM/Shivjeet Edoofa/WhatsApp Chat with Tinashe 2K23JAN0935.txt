Students learn about counseling theories, techniques, and ethical considerations. Understanding the dynamics of counseling relationships, therapeutic communication, and empathy is emphasized. The course may delve into various approaches, such as person-centered, cognitive-behavioral, and psychodynamic counseling. Students also explore the importance of creating a safe and non-judgmental space for clients, active listening, and rapport building. Overall, the course lays the foundation for those interested in pursuing a career in counseling, providing insights into the dynamics of therapeutic interactions and the potential impact on individuals seeking help.
