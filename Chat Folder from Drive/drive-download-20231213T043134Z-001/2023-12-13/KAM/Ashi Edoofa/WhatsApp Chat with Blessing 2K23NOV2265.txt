07/12/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I believe Ms. Vilsha must have asked you to share your academic documents with us, and I wanted to acknowledge that you need to share them as well. 

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
07/12/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. Visit Your School: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. Provide Necessary Information: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. Printing and Signing: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. Include Authority Details: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
07/12/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
07/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 087 8756: as for now am not yet sure whether my school administrators are there since schools closed last week,so I will have to check with them first
07/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 087 8756: so ma'am does it mean that the statement of entry (A level) will no longer be required?
07/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 087 8756: which was said to be an alternative for the recommendation letter
07/12/23, 3:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the above information with us Blessing, I can understand the situation however I would like to encourage you to contact with your school authorities regarding the letter of recommendation.

07/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am
07/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 087 8756: okay ma'am

Hence, can you let me know at what time will you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
09/12/23, 6:02 pm - +263 78 087 8756: I am ready ma'am, let's start
09/12/23, 6:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 087 8756: I am done ma'am
09/12/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
09/12/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
09/12/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
09/12/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
09/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 087 8756: they are clear ma'am
09/12/23, 6:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
09/12/23, 6:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
09/12/23, 6:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
09/12/23, 6:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
09/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 087 8756: am following ma'am
09/12/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
09/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
09/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
09/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
09/12/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am
09/12/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
09/12/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 087 8756: let's start ma'am
09/12/23, 6:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
09/12/23, 6:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
11/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am
My first learning that l understood is that a student should be teachable and open minded.Secondly, a student should follow Edoofa 's instructions.
Moreover, Edoofa is also focused on increasing a student 's capacity for success, which means making us as students more responsible and independent and not only to us"students" affordable quality education
Furthermore, statement of Purpose is an important document,and students should be very careful in taking action and diligent in filling it out
11/12/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Blessing, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 087 8756: l totally agree ma'am and also understand them thanks
11/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome Blessing, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
11/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 087 8756: Indeed we are
11/12/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263780878756, Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:00 PM.
11/12/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

11/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 087 8756: *3. Please share your understanding about GAAP and it's importance.
*
GAAP is a set of guidelines that govern the preparation of financial statements.It is important for businesses to adhere to GAAP because it ensures that their financial statements are accurate and transparent.This allows investors, creditors and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about a company 's financial health.Stakeholders are individuals or companies that have an interest and are affected by a business ' actions.Furthermore, GAAP ensures that companies are operating ethically and in compliance with the law.Without GAAP,it would be difficult to compare the financial statements of different companies, making it difficult to assess their performance.
Beyond transparency and ethical behavior,GAAP also has a number of benefits or importances.It helps to promote consistency and comparability in financial reporting.GAAP promotes efficiency by allowing companies to use standardized financial statements, making it easier to share information with others.GAAP helps to protect the public by ensuring that companies are held accountable for their financial statements.GAAP plays a role in the tax code ,as some provisions of tax code are based on GAAP.Finally , GAAP is used in a variety of other settings such as when negotiating contracts
11/12/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 087 8756: *2 What is the relationship between entraprenuership and economic development?
*
Entrepreneurship is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a viable business.Risk taking, resourcefulness, creativity and willingness are required to put in hard work.Whereas economic development is the process of improving the quality of life for the community members by creating more jobs , increasing incomes and expanding the range of opportunities available to it's residents.It also focus on creating a more equitable and sustainable society.
There is a strong correlation between the two with entrepreneurship often viewed as a key driver of economic development.Entrepreneurship creates jobs,drives innovation,and generates income, all of which contribute to a country's economic growth.In turn, economic development creates an environment that is conducive to entrepreneurship, providing the necessary resources and infrastructure for business to thrive.
Another important factor is the role of government policy.Governments can create policies that support or hinder entrepreneurship and in turn , impact economic development.Policies that support entrepreneurs ,such as tax incentives or access to capital,can help to spur innovation and growth.
Therefore,l can say that entrepreneurship and economic development have a symbiotic relationship,they need each other to be successful

11/12/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 087 8756: *4.What are accounting standards and why are they mandatory?* 
 
 Accounting standards are the rules and regulations that govern the preparation of financial statements. These standards are developed by various standard-setting bodies, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States.Accounting standards are mandatory is because they help to protect the public interest. Without standards, companies could potentially manipulate their financial information to make their performance look better than it really is. This could lead to investors and creditors making decisions based on false or misleading information. Additionally, if a company's financial statements are not prepared in accordance with standards, it could lead to unfair practices such as tax evasion. So, in a way, standards help to protect the public by ensuring that companies are following the rules and disclosing accurate information.  They ensure consistency and comparability in financial reporting. Without these standards, businesses could use different methods of reporting their financial information, making it difficult to compare and analyze the financial health of different companies. By requiring businesses to follow the same standards, accounting standards help to create a level playing field and promote transparency in the market.
11/12/23, 10:12 pm - +263 78 087 8756: *5.Differentiate between Accounting and Auditing* 
 Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, they actually have distinct meanings. Accounting refers to the process of recording and reporting financial transactions, whereas auditing is the independent examination of those transactions and reports. In other words, accountants are responsible for preparing financial statements, while auditors are responsible for reviewing those statements and ensuring that they are accurate and in compliance with relevant standards. So, accounting is more of a bookkeeping function, while auditing is more of a quality control function.  So, the main purpose of accounting is to provide information that is useful in making economic decisions, while the main purpose of auditing is to provide assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatements. Accounting is also more forward-looking, as it focuses on future transactions and events, while auditing is more backward-looking, as it focuses on past transactions and events.Auditing uses a reasonable assurance standard, meaning that there is a high degree of confidence that the financial statements are accurate and complete. Auditing also goes a step further by looking for fraud and irregularities in the financial statements. <This message was edited>

12/12/23, 11:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Blessing, Wishing you a wonderful day!

Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. Hence, I would like to know if you are ready for today's session?
12/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 087 8756: morning ma'am,l am ready
12/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 489 7686: Morning Ashi. Thanks for sharing and your entire effort. We, parents, are watching the progress from this end
12/12/23, 11:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263784897686, You are truly welcome, I am happy to know that you are following the journey with Blessing.
12/12/23, 11:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation dear, Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (15-Dec-2023).
12/12/23, 11:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/IuhmnORIlZy8RU7Q1Cmh8R
12/12/23, 11:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Blessing Panashe Chavirima, and my EWYL group name is Blessing EWYL23E1005. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (15-Dec-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
12/12/23, 11:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
12/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am, let me do it now
12/12/23, 12:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263780878756, Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BCom* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
12/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 087 8756: Yes ma'am it is
12/12/23, 12:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/12/23, 12:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/12/23, 12:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/12/23, 12:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am
12/12/23, 12:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263780878756 . Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/12/23, 12:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/12/23, 12:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 087 8756: correct, my counselor discussed about it
12/12/23, 12:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 087 8756: we are, ma'am
12/12/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
12/12/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
12/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes l have
12/12/23, 12:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
12/12/23, 12:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 087 8756: l understand
12/12/23, 12:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/12/23, 12:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/12/23, 12:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 087 8756: l have question ma'am
12/12/23, 12:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please go ahead with your question, Blessing. I'll be more than happy to assist you.
12/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 087 8756: ma'am,is the registration fee due (1000) different from the registration fee that will be   adjusted within my first year fee? <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me inform you dear that the registration fees of $1000 which will be needed to reserve the scholarship seat at the university, is not an additional cost as it will be adjusted towards your first-year tuition fee.
12/12/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you understand?
12/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 087 8756: l understand now
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to know that @263780878756
12/12/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 087 8756: for now I do not have any , ma'am
12/12/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
12/12/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
12/12/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
12/12/23, 12:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
12/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes , l am proud to be an Edoofian
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am it does
12/12/23, 1:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
12/12/23, 1:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am it does
12/12/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/12/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/12/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 087 8756: I am following, and as for now there is nothing that I would like to inquire about
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263780878756, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 087 8756: may you provide me with more information please
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
12/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 087 8756: it's now clearer ma'am
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
12/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 087 8756: l get your point ma'am <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263780878756. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 087 8756: I definitely agree with you
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am,l am
12/12/23, 1:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
12/12/23, 1:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 087 8756: clear, ma'am
12/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
12/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 087 8756: l understand this as well,but l would urge someone to go for either of the first two options other than this
12/12/23, 2:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I resonate with your thoughts dear, Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 087 8756: What the costs will be for my admission process and my higher education?
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Let me assist you here please that at the moment we will not be able to share your exact cost of education as this will be decided once you will receive your offer letter from the university. However, we have shared the estimate cost of education with you during our sessions, I hope you understand?
12/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 087 8756: ooh,l understand ma'am
12/12/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that @263780878756, So are you excited to initiate the process?

12/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
