07/12/23, 12:37 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: We are fine thank you.
How are you?
07/12/23, 12:38 pm - +265 999 95 13 02: We're okay, that side?
07/12/23, 12:41 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: Pretty good
07/12/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Noted Freda, Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other, I'm eager to learn more about you. Could you kindly provide an introduction of yourself and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping your educational plans?
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Well. My name is Freda Mbozi. I was born on the third of April 2002. I am 21 years of age. I was born in a family of 3. However we have lived as an extended family of 8 for almost all my life. My father being the first born of his family, he is also is responsible for looking after his other 3 brothers hence totaling to 8 when I include my mother, older brother and little sister. As I was clocking towards 2014. I was lucky enough to be selected to a government school known as Chichiri Secondary School where I did my secondary school (high school) education and was able to complete in 2018. 2019 through the help of my family and other well wishers I started my Bachelor’s Degree program in Business Administration- Management at Malawi Adventist University though the fees gathered was only able to carter for two years. In my Second year I was able to find a part time job where I worked at Lagra Centre Branch as an Administrative assistant from Fridays to Sundays giving me a chance to attend classes during weekdays. Knowing the financial situation we had I would exceed the normal credit hours or courses I was required to take with three 4 extra courses of the upcoming semester on conditions that I do not fail even one course by our academic advisor and head of department which I fulfilled finishing in my 7th semester and not my 8th. I finished in august 2022 but my graduation occurred in July 2023.

The sponsor or rather guardians has been my father but my brother comes in here and there.
07/12/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your inspiring journey with me. It's evident that you've faced various challenges throughout your academic path, yet your determination and hard work shine through. Congratulations on completing your Bachelor's Degree program in Business Administration-Management at Malawi Adventist University. 

It's heartening to hear about the support from your family, especially your father and brother, as well as other well-wishers. Extended families often provide a strong foundation, and your story reflects the strength that comes from such bonds.

I can imagine the pride your family must feel, and you should be proud of yourself as well. Graduating in July 2023 is a significant accomplishment, and I'm sure it marks the beginning of a new chapter for you. As you move forward, may your education and experiences continue to shape a bright and fulfilling future.
07/12/23, 2:31 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much we really do truly appreciate it.
It’s really been nothing but testimonies
07/12/23, 2:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @265996406762, Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention.

Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand.

07/12/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
07/12/23, 3:24 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok.
07/12/23, 3:25 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: The messages are loud and clear
07/12/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
07/12/23, 3:53 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright
With my counselor we managed to cover four stages. 
Where the first stage look at a brief detail on both ends. Which was mine and Edoofa’s as well. It gave an insight and deep understanding on its goals and what it’s all about. 

Secondly, we have an eligible check where they’re were interviews and other necessary documents and questions 

After Edoofa’s serious consideration, I was luckily enough to be accepted into Edoofa’s scholarship program. Which is the third step.

Lastly, we we’re guided to the right enrollment processes. Which have been fulfilled.

Then the counselor said we leave the rest to here so believe  that’s why this group was made
07/12/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words and feedback about your counseling session. We're thrilled to see that you have shared such amazing insights with us. The guidance provided by your counselor is absolutely right, from now on we will be here for you to guide you further for your journey.

09/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
09/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
09/12/23, 3:51 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Very clear. Very interesting
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
09/12/23, 3:58 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I’m on track
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
09/12/23, 4:04 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: If possible can you expand more on this
09/12/23, 4:04 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: If possible
09/12/23, 4:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, we will have a detail discussion about this soon in our upcoming session.
09/12/23, 4:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
09/12/23, 4:06 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright great
09/12/23, 4:06 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: You can proceed
09/12/23, 4:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
09/12/23, 4:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
09/12/23, 4:15 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Lovely. Please do
09/12/23, 4:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, let me share all the videos with you and I am sure you must be excited for the videos.
09/12/23, 4:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265996406762 , I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
09/12/23, 4:27 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright
09/12/23, 4:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know by when you will be able to go through the videos?
09/12/23, 4:28 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I am about to start
09/12/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, please let me know once you are done with the videos.
09/12/23, 5:02 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I’m done watching
09/12/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
09/12/23, 5:17 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Okay.
The videos in summary are explaining about the enrollment process and Edoofa’s vision for us scholars. It’s really comforting to know that Edoofa  has 20 years experience and takes its time to ensure and guide student towards their paths and education rather the right university selection. To top that off it’s other focus is on providing employable education which is very helpful.
The systematicness of the Edoofa’s process is very nice putting into consideration the example of the student from Ghana who tried to get their higher education in China.

However the statement of purpose is the most touching of them all because not only is giving a reflection to as why the student is the right fit but also giving a sense of self awareness
09/12/23, 5:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @265996406762 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
09/12/23, 5:26 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes i am able to understand. Thank you for enlightening us
09/12/23, 5:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
09/12/23, 5:29 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes we are moving together
09/12/23, 5:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday at 2:00 PM.
09/12/23, 5:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

09/12/23, 5:37 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright trying my best from this end.

11/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Freda, I hope you had an amazing weekend. 

Thank you for sharing the confirmation regarding SOP form. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. May I know if you are ready for today's session? <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 2:23 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes. Scheduled for 4pm right?
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, Our session is scheduled for 2:00pm as we discussed on Saturday please. However, If you want to reschedule our session, we can definitely do that dear
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: No we can proceed
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (15-Dec-2023).
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/ChhIgNyB5c73ASpMSd1Zbk
11/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Freda Mbozi, and my EWYL group name is Freda EWYL23E0996. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (15-Dec-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
11/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
11/12/23, 2:41 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok. That will done shortly
11/12/23, 2:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @265996406762. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Masters in Business Administration* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Very accurate
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/12/23, 2:48 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes that much is true
11/12/23, 2:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @265996406762 . Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/12/23, 2:48 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Great
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/12/23, 2:52 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Well noted
11/12/23, 3:08 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:08 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: My JCE results have finally been sorted
11/12/23, 3:09 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Could please expand more on this
11/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your JCE document with us @265996406762, I'll update the same in our records. Let's move ahead with the session -
11/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/12/23, 3:17 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes we’re on the same page
11/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
11/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/12/23, 3:22 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I’m following
11/12/23, 3:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
11/12/23, 3:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
11/12/23, 3:33 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: If I may ask wasn’t it $2000-3000 per annum?
11/12/23, 3:33 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, You are absolutely right dear that your cost of education range is between $2000 - $3000 and with the example shared above we have shared the cost of education is $2800 which falls under the same range. However, I would like to highlight that this is the example not your actual cost of education, I hope you understand?
11/12/23, 3:41 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok i understand. Very clear
11/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/12/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/12/23, 3:49 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I’m on track
11/12/23, 3:50 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes this we are aware
11/12/23, 3:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/12/23, 4:27 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: No queries at all
11/12/23, 4:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

11/12/23, 4:35 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Lovely
11/12/23, 4:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Freda. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
11/12/23, 4:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/12/23, 4:43 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Amazing
11/12/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/12/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/12/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
11/12/23, 4:57 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I have read them all
11/12/23, 4:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/12/23, 4:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/12/23, 4:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/12/23, 5:02 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright great
11/12/23, 5:02 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Wow. This is nice
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/12/23, 5:22 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes this is quite considerate
11/12/23, 5:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/12/23, 5:30 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Understood
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/12/23, 5:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/12/23, 5:35 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I’m following
11/12/23, 5:36 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: If any question arises I will not hesitate to ask
11/12/23, 5:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that @265996406762, So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
11/12/23, 5:38 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Very excited
11/12/23, 5:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
