06/09/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 459 2418: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms it is duly noted with us and we will update them in our records.

06/09/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
06/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes
06/09/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 459 2418: I have gone through the image
06/09/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
06/09/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
06/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes very clear maam
06/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
06/09/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
06/09/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected?
06/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes
06/09/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
06/09/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/09/23, 8:40 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes that's clear
06/09/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
06/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes
06/09/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
06/09/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
06/09/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
06/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Yes please
06/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
06/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
06/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
06/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
06/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Ok will do so
06/09/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us reconnect tomorrow at 09.00 pm. I hope you will be able to go through the videos by that time.

08/09/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Zibusiso.

I hope you are doing well, With regard to our conversation, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
08/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes
08/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Good evening
08/09/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
10/09/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 459 2418: Sorry for the late response had no data.....the videos tell me about the qualities needed to be a successful edoofian. The founders also share the character and attributes that a successful edoofian needs to have so as to stand out from the rest. The other videos tell us about how Edoofa finds the best schools, colleges and universities for their applicants. Unfortunately i could not download the fourth video , the link was said to have expired
11/09/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/09/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/09/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zibusiso.

I hope you are doing well, I understand that network can be an issue, so thank you for sharing your understanding, that is alright, Let me help you understand.  In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/09/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/09/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
12/09/23, 4:03 am - +263 71 459 2418: Oky maam that is understood thank you for the explanation
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zibusiso.

13/09/23, 1:48 am - +263 71 459 2418: This message was deleted
13/09/23, 1:48 am - +263 71 459 2418: Oky maam
13/09/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zibusiso.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
13/09/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

14/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 459 2418: 2. The Business Process Management (BPM) life cycle is a structured approach used to manage and improve business processes. It comprises six stages that help organizations design, model, execute, monitor, optimize, and reengineer their processes.

In the design phase, the process objectives, inputs, outputs, stakeholders, and resources are identified. The modeling stage involves creating visual representations of the process flow and simulating its performance. The execution phase entails implementing and controlling the process to ensure it meets the designed objectives.

During the monitoring phase, the process performance is measured and analyzed for improvement opportunities. The optimization stage aims to enhance process efficiency and eliminate bottlenecks and waste based on the data analysis. Finally, if the process cannot be optimized, the reengineering stage involves redesigning the process from scratch.

The BPM life cycle is iterative and continuous until the desired process performance is achieved. By adopting the BPM life cycle, organizations can streamline their processes, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction
14/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Businesses contribute significantly to economic development by creating employment opportunities, generating revenue, promoting innovation and technology, and enhancing competition. When businesses grow and expand, they create a ripple effect on the economy by boosting consumer spending, increasing tax revenues, and improving the overall standard of living.

For example, the technology giant Apple contributes to economic development in various ways. Apple's products and services have a significant impact on consumer spending, leading to increased demand for related goods and services. The company also employs over 147,000 people directly and indirectly, including engineers, designers, marketers, and suppliers. Apple's operations generate substantial tax revenues for local and national governments, which support public services and infrastructure projects. Additionally, through its innovative technologies and products, Apple fosters entrepreneurship and creates new business opportunities for developers and entrepreneurs, which ultimately contributes to economic growth and

As we all know in the business world the customer is the king, the customer is never wrong. I think being a shopkeeper in my mom's tuckshop has really helped me to elevate myself and get to know how it really feels to be in the business sector. I usually help my mom in balancing off her books of accounts and making sure her business doesn't run a loss. When ever she buys new stock she always turns up to me so I can help her to record and make sure we price the new stock in a way that will give us some profits. I also think that as someone who works in the business sector we have to be able to convince customers using the sweet business language. I have also managed to attract many customers to buy from our tuckshop due to my very sweet and charming tongue. I think my mom's tuckshop has really helped me a lot in preparation for the future.
14/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Human resources play a crucial role in the success and sustainability of any organization. The importance of human resources can be seen in several aspects:

Firstly, human resources are responsible for recruiting and selecting the right people for the job. A well-designed recruitment process that focuses on the skills, experience, and qualifications required for the role ensures that the organization has the best talent available. This, in turn, helps to improve productivity and performance.

Secondly, human resources are responsible for training and development of employees. Providing employees with necessary training and development opportunities allows them to build their skills, knowledge, and expertise, which can improve their effectiveness and efficiency in carrying out their roles.

Thirdly, human resources are responsible for creating a healthy work environment that promotes employee engagement and motivation. When employees feel valued and appreciated, they are more likely to be committed to the organization's goals and objectives, leading to improved productivity and performance.

Fourthly, human resources are responsible for managing employee relations and resolving conflicts. Effective management of employee relations leads to a harmonious working environment, which fosters collaboration and teamwork.

Finally, human resources are responsible for ensuring compliance with legal requirements related to employment. This includes providing fair compensation, implementing health and safety measures, and promoting diversity and inclusion.

In conclusion, human resources are an integral part of any organization and contribute significantly to its success. By recruiting and selecting the right people, providing training and development opportunities, creating a positive work environment, managing employee relations, and ensuring compliance with legal requirements, human resources support the organization's goals and objectives while ensuring the well-being
14/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 459 2418: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
14/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
14/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
14/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Oky maam
14/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes that is correct
14/09/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
14/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes I am
14/09/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
14/09/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
14/09/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
14/09/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
14/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes
14/09/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
14/09/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
14/09/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
14/09/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes that's clear
14/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
14/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes we are on the same page✅
14/09/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
14/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes noted
14/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
14/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
14/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Oky I understand no questions so far
14/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
14/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/09/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/09/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 459 2418: No questions so far
14/09/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction. We will reconnect today at 09.00 pm. I hope you and your parents will be available.
14/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Oky thank you we will be available have a great day

15/09/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now I believe you have had a discussion with your family regarding your admission process, so I would like to know if you have any queries or concerns to share?
15/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 71 459 2418: No concerns maam
16/09/23, 7:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Zibusiso.

16/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes I am available
19/09/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Zibusiso,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow at 01.00 P.M. I hope this time works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 7:21 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Oky thanks
19/09/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Thank you so much, next year by this time my son will be amongst those landing in India, we are so excited.
19/09/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263775722942 Indeed, I am very excited for Zibusiso, to be in these arrival pictures next year. I am sure, he is going to make you proud.
19/09/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 572 2942: We hope so because he is a very committed and disciplined child
20/09/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Zibusiso.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Evening ma'am, yes we are available
20/09/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now I believe you have had a discussion with your family regarding your admission process, so I would like to know if you have any queries or concerns to share?
20/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 459 2418: No concerns so far
20/09/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. Alright please, Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/09/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
20/09/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Oky thank you so much
20/09/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
20/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
20/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 459 2418: I am done
20/09/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/09/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
20/09/23, 9:57 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes very clear
20/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes yes very clear
20/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yeah you may continue it's still as clear as daylight
20/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/09/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 5, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 5, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 5, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 71 459 2418: No you may continue
20/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
20/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Please provide me with the Information
20/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
20/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
20/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
20/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
20/09/23, 10:26 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Oky it's now clear thanks
20/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
20/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes that's true
20/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
20/09/23, 10:30 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes true
20/09/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
20/09/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
20/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes very clear
20/09/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
20/09/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
20/09/23, 10:33 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes very clear
20/09/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
20/09/23, 10:35 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Oky I understand but for me that's not an option I would chose
20/09/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are confident that you will not put a stop to your academic career. 

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 10:38 pm - +263 71 459 2418: No ma'am you have made everything very clear so far
20/09/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now as Zibusiso's guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Zibusiso is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/09/23, 10:41 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes I am very much excited
20/09/23, 10:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
20/09/23, 10:43 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Oky thank you ma'am have a lovely night
20/09/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, thank you and have a great night to you too.
21/09/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Zibusiso.

26/09/23, 1:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 6:24 am - +263 71 459 2418: Thank you maam
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Zibusiso!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
27/09/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes
27/09/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
28/09/23, 5:12 am - +263 71 459 2418: 1. USD1800
28/09/23, 5:12 am - +263 71 459 2418: 2. 3 years
28/09/23, 5:14 am - +263 71 459 2418: 3.  300 USD
28/09/23, 5:14 am - +263 71 459 2418: 4.   $600
28/09/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Zibusiso!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Zibusiso, regarding this answer, please go through the offer letter once again and then let me know of the right answer dear.
28/09/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 459 2418: Its $900
28/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
28/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Yes very clear
28/09/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
28/09/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
28/09/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
28/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 71 459 2418: So how much is the first payment & when is the deadline
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Zibusiso!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to discuss that further during our discussion here. Before that, may I know if you are clear till here please?
29/09/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 572 2942: Good morning, about accommodation everything is clear, what we want to know is the $300 admission fee when is it due, registration fee due date and amount?
29/09/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to discuss that moving ahead during our conversation. Now, Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
29/09/23, 10:37 am - +263 77 572 2942: Yes sir, understood
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
29/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Yes very clear
29/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
29/09/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Oky please explain the payment process clearly I'm a little bit confused
29/09/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know about what are you confused please?
29/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Please explain the amounts to be paid and the due dates
29/09/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
29/09/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
29/09/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
29/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Oky ma'am I would we would prefer to make the payment as part payments.
29/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Very clear now sir
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Zibusiso!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in a meeting that came up. I appreciate your patience here, let us continue with our discussion.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
30/09/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 572 2942: Good morning, we stay in Bulawayo, will appreciate if you send alternative modes for deposit
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Zibusiso!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Good afternoon, noted will communicate with him
03/10/23, 2:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Alternatively, I was going through your admission file and I noticed that you made the payment of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi via Mukuru. So, if you wish to use Mukuru for the payment of your registration fee, you can do that as well through the Mukuru Account of our associates in Africa. Now, while making the payment through Mukuru, you have two options, either you can do it via Mr. Shorwi for which the transfer charges will be 11% of the amount that you will be transferring, or you can do it through Mr. Rajan, for which the transfer charges would be 7% of the amount that you will be transferring. So, shall I share the Mukuru Account Details with you as well?
03/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Yes please share
03/10/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Here are the account details of Mr. Shorwi as well as Mr. Rajan, and based on the amount of transfer charges applicable on both the modes, you can make the payment accordingly as per your preference.
03/10/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Here are the *Mukuru account details*

03/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Ok will use Mr Rajan Nayer's details and forward the payment voucher by the 10th
03/10/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
03/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Noted sir, will put that in my diary
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
03/10/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Zibusiso!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter from the university. May I know by when can we reconnect with each other here for the same?
05/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Good afternoon
05/10/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: How are you doing today Zibusiso?
05/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 572 2942: We are fine, sorry for late response
05/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Noted
05/10/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, before moving ahead, can you please let me know if you are clear till here?
05/10/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Yes very clear
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Zibusiso!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
06/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Good afternoon, yes we understand, the EWYL program will indeed help us earn scholarship credits through hardwork
09/10/23, 5:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Zibusiso!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 5:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier on Friday, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 5:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, since you are clear till here, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here please?
09/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 572 2942: Evening, yes connected
09/10/23, 6:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
09/10/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 459 2418: Nooo no queries
09/10/23, 6:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
09/10/23, 6:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour
