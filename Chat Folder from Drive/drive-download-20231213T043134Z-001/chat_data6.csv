328 - 12 Dec 2023 07:54AM - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Colleen How are you?  I completely understand the challenges you're facing. Balancing school, study time, and sessions can indeed be overwhelming, especially with extra modules on your plate.  Regarding your target of 20 students, I acknowledge the difficulties arising from students working with agents from other organizations. Let's try to brainstorm and reach your target—maybe refining our approach or identifying unique aspects that can set. We can also schedule a call if you need some guidance for the projects.  Feel free to share your thoughts or any specific areas you'd like my help with.

I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant? 2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant? 3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?

43 - 12 Dec 2023 09:27AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

257 - 12 Dec 2023 02:53PM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action tomorrow for December accordingly:  1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant? 2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant? 3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
258 - 12 Dec 2023 03:01PM - +91 79737 30374: For now I have 2 but I'm not yet certain because their source of income are not stable. They promise to come back to me this week after enough discussion with their parents. That's where I am for now

There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.

210 - 09 Dec 2023 01:57PM - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Saturday: Let's Practice Microsoft Excel_*  I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  *Activity Instructions:*  ⭕Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.  ⭕Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes).""  ⭕Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the ""Activity"" column.  ⭕Specify Days: In the ""Day of the Week"" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.  ⭕Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the ""Time Spent"" column.  ⭕Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.  ⭕Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.  ⭕Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"").  Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet. Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.  ⭕Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes).""  ⭕Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the ""Activity"" column.  ⭕Specify Days: In the ""Day of the Week"" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.  ⭕Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the ""Time Spent"" column.  ⭕Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.  ⭕Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.  ⭕Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"").  Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet. Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions.

Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  *Activity Instructions:*  ⭕Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.  ⭕Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes).""  ⭕Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the ""Activity"" column.  ⭕Specify Days: In the ""Day of the Week"" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.  ⭕Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the ""Time Spent"" column.  ⭕Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.  ⭕Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.  ⭕Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"").  Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet. Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions.

It is actually a good scholarship program to help all the African students,as well it is a 50% scholarship but with good benefits provided by it through the EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM. The Earn While You Learn Program is a project introduced by EDOOFA to help us students to get credits on  our own with the help of our project mentors to raise fees in order to cut the costs for our parents and guardians. We do all these tasks with the help of our mentors. These projects are very helpful to us students in the sense that,they helps us to develop the leadership skills like confidence and good communication skills, moreover each week we do online webinars with different motivational speakers, the webinars are very important to us as the stories shared are very inspiring. Our mentors are not only there for the projects but they are also our guardians here as we are too far away from home. We share our problems with them and they always offer good solutions to us.  These projects are done from the first year semester up until you finish your course. So while l was still in Zimbabwe l managed to do quite well in my projects and my credits are increasing.

277 - 12 Dec 2023 10:59AM - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *""I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
278 - 12 Dec 2023 10:59AM - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *""I am a proud Edoofian*.

307 - 09 Dec 2023 06:47PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,  I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  Activity Instructions:  Open Microsoft Excel:  Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you. Set Up Columns:  Create three columns with the following headers: ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes)."" Record Your Activities:  Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. In the ""Activity"" column, list each activity separately. Specify Days:  In the ""Day of the Week"" column, record the corresponding day for each activity. Log Time:  In the ""Time Spent"" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity. Calculate Average Time:  Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week. Reflect:  In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent. Save and Submit:  Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx""). Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.  Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.  Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!  Best regards, Ms. Saloni

266 - 09 Dec 2023 07:00PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,  I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  Activity Instructions:  Open Microsoft Excel:  Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you. Set Up Columns:  Create three columns with the following headers: ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes)."" Record Your Activities:  Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. In the ""Activity"" column, list each activity separately. Specify Days:  In the ""Day of the Week"" column, record the corresponding day for each activity. Log Time:  In the ""Time Spent"" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity. Calculate Average Time:  Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week. Reflect:  In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent. Save and Submit:  Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx""). Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.  Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.  Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!  Best regards, Ms. Saloni

168 - 09 Dec 2023 12:47PM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Annette I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  Activity Instructions:  Open Microsoft Excel:  Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you. Set Up Columns:  Create three columns with the following headers: ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes)."" Record Your Activities:  Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. In the ""Activity"" column, list each activity separately. Specify Days:  In the ""Day of the Week"" column, record the corresponding day for each activity. Log Time:  In the ""Time Spent"" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity. Calculate Average Time:  Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week. Reflect:  In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent. Save and Submit:  Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx""). Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.  Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *""I am a proud Edoofian*.

This project is about building a network of partner companies and possibly future employers... it involves reaching it to influential people and having a ""never giver give up"" attitude  3. This project involves creating an opportunity for others to get to know the Edoofa program and it's mission... it involves opportunity identification and being able to be enthusiastic about it  4. This project involves connecting with local secondary schools and educating them on the edoofa program... it involves communicating to influential people and bring able to face rejection

It's about the journey.""*  🌟 What it Means: Imagine your favorite video game. Sure, finishing a level is awesome, but the real joy? It's in navigating the challenges, learning new skills, and enjoying the process.  Similarly, Sundar Pichai's quote reminds us that success isn't just reaching goals—it's about embracing the adventure, learning, and growing along the way. So, let's dive into today's lesson with the spirit of enjoying the journey!
112 - 12 Dec 2023 08:37AM - Sharda Edoofa: Well done, Faith. It clearly shows that you have read the document in detail. Keep it Up!✈️

For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*. 2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*. 3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!

251 - 09 Dec 2023 07:37PM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Kelvin, I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  Activity Instructions:  Open Microsoft Excel:  Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you. Set Up Columns:  Create three columns with the following headers: ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes)."" Record Your Activities:  Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. In the ""Activity"" column, list each activity separately. Specify Days:  In the ""Day of the Week"" column, record the corresponding day for each activity. Log Time:  In the ""Time Spent"" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity. Calculate Average Time:  Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week. Reflect:  In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent. Save and Submit:  Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx""). Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.  Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.  Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!  Best regards,  Team EWYL

It's about the journey.""*  🌟 What it Means: Imagine your favorite video game. Sure, finishing a level is awesome, but the real joy? It's in navigating the challenges, learning new skills, and enjoying the process.  Similarly, Sundar Pichai's quote reminds us that success isn't just reaching goals—it's about embracing the adventure, learning, and growing along the way. So, let's dive into today's lesson with the spirit of enjoying the journey!
305 - 12 Dec 2023 08:51AM - +263 78 660 9547: Okay Ms Sharda that's fine

Make it personal by sharing why you're excited about it.  Friend Referrals: Encourage each member in your WhatsApp group to invite at least one friend. Personal recommendations go a long way.  Simple Social Media Posts: Share Edoofa information on your personal social media accounts. You can start with a simple post like, ""Hey friends, found an amazing opportunity with Edoofa. Join me!""
316 - 12 Dec 2023 09:10AM - Sharda Edoofa: Lunchtime Chats: During lunch breaks, casually talk to friends about Edoofa. Share your positive experiences and explain how it can benefit them.  Study Group Integration: If you're part of any study groups, take a few minutes to discuss Edoofa at the beginning or end of the session.  Ask for Help: Reach out to your teachers or any school leaders. They might be willing to make a quick announcement or include Edoofa info in school newsletters.  Remember, it's the small actions that lead to big results. Keep up the fantastic work, and let's see that community grow!

319 - 12 Dec 2023 09:18AM - +263 78 660 9547: Another thing Ms Sharda I would like to ask, how long does it take for the board to confirm your payments after you have paid your final part of the University registration fee because I paid mine a few weeks.
320 - 12 Dec 2023 09:39AM - Sharda Edoofa: great.
321 - 12 Dec 2023 09:41AM - Sharda Edoofa: This is indeed a genuine concern and since this is an admission related concern I would suggest you ask about this to your admissions officer. They will help you understand that and if you do not get any reply from there. Do inform me accordingly.
322 - 12 Dec 2023 09:44AM - +263 78 660 9547: Oky Ms Sharda
323 - 12 Dec 2023 09:44AM - +263 78 660 9547: We may proceed I am clear
324 - 12 Dec 2023 09:56AM - Sharda Edoofa: Great to hear that you're taking the initiative to talk to school principals about the Edoofa Scholarship program. It's a fantastic project, and your efforts can make a real difference.  Here are some ways you can reach out:  Write a Letter or Email: Craft a well-written letter or email introducing yourself and explaining why the Edoofa Scholarship program matters. Share details about the program and kindly request a meeting with the school principal.  Give them a Call: A phone call can be a direct and effective way to connect. Be concise, share your enthusiasm for the Edoofa program, and express your interest in setting up a meeting.  Connect on Social Media: Schools are often on social media. Drop them a message or comment on their posts expressing your interest in discussing the scholarship program further. Remember to keep it professional.  Visit in Person: If possible, visit the school in person. Schedule a meeting with the principal and use the opportunity to present the Edoofa Scholarship program. Face-to-face interactions can leave a lasting impression.  Involve Student Representatives: If there are student representatives in your school, team up with them. They can be influential in communicating your message to the school administration.  Attend School Events: Participate in school events where principals are present. Take the chance to briefly introduce yourself and express your interest in discussing the Edoofa Scholarship program later on.  Ask for Teacher Support: Teachers often have good connections with school administrators. Discuss your plan with teachers and seek their support in arranging a meeting with the principal.  Create Eye-Catching Materials: Design informative materials about Edoofa – maybe a cool brochure or a presentation. Share these materials with the principal, along with your request for a meeting.

271 - 09 Dec 2023 07:40PM - Sharda Edoofa: Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  Activity Instructions:  Open Microsoft Excel:  Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you. Set Up Columns:  Create three columns with the following headers: ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes)."" Record Your Activities:  Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. In the ""Activity"" column, list each activity separately. Specify Days:  In the ""Day of the Week"" column, record the corresponding day for each activity. Log Time:  In the ""Time Spent"" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity. Calculate Average Time:  Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week. Reflect:  In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent. Save and Submit:  Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx""). Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.  Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  Activity Instructions:  Open Microsoft Excel:  Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you. Set Up Columns:  Create three columns with the following headers: ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes)."" Record Your Activities:  Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. In the ""Activity"" column, list each activity separately. Specify Days:  In the ""Day of the Week"" column, record the corresponding day for each activity. Log Time:  In the ""Time Spent"" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity. Calculate Average Time:  Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week. Reflect:  In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent. Save and Submit:  Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx""). Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.  Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.  Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!  Best regards,  Team EWYL

160 - 12 Dec 2023 01:38PM - Sharda Edoofa: Let's kick off today's session with a quote from the tech maestro, Sundar Pichai: ""Success is not about the destination. It's about the journey.""  🌟 What it Means: Imagine your favorite video game. Sure, finishing a level is awesome, but the real joy? It's in navigating the challenges, learning new skills, and enjoying the process.
161 - 12 Dec 2023 01:39PM - +263 78 068 4943: Okay, that's alright
162 - 12 Dec 2023 02:03PM - Sharda Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio? Kindly share your understanding of the same.
163 - 12 Dec 2023 02:08PM - +263 78 068 4943: Is a project which involves reaching out to the headmasters of the surrounding high schools including mine , telling them how and why l joined Edoofa and then connect them with the director of Edoofa
164 - 12 Dec 2023 02:10PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Prosper
165 - 12 Dec 2023 02:10PM - Sharda Edoofa: Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:  STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​ ​​ STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
166 - 12 Dec 2023 02:10PM - Sharda Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.
206 - 12 Dec 2023 02:38PM - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *""I am a proud Edoofian*.

756 - 09 Dec 2023 07:40PM - Sharda Edoofa: Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  Activity Instructions:  Open Microsoft Excel:  Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you. Set Up Columns:  Create three columns with the following headers: ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes)."" Record Your Activities:  Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. In the ""Activity"" column, list each activity separately. Specify Days:  In the ""Day of the Week"" column, record the corresponding day for each activity. Log Time:  In the ""Time Spent"" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity. Calculate Average Time:  Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week. Reflect:  In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent. Save and Submit:  Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx""). Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.  Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.  Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!  Best regards,  Team EWYL

100 - 09 Dec 2023 07:38PM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Shaun, I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  Activity Instructions:  Open Microsoft Excel:  Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you. Set Up Columns:  Create three columns with the following headers: ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes)."" Record Your Activities:  Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. In the ""Activity"" column, list each activity separately. Specify Days:  In the ""Day of the Week"" column, record the corresponding day for each activity. Log Time:  In the ""Time Spent"" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity. Calculate Average Time:  Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week. Reflect:  In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent. Save and Submit:  Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx""). Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.  Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

247 - 09 Dec 2023 12:55PM - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Takunda, I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  Activity Instructions:  Open Microsoft Excel:  Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you. Set Up Columns:  Create three columns with the following headers: ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes)."" Record Your Activities:  Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. In the ""Activity"" column, list each activity separately. Specify Days:  In the ""Day of the Week"" column, record the corresponding day for each activity. Log Time:  In the ""Time Spent"" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity. Calculate Average Time:  Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week. Reflect:  In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent. Save and Submit:  Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx""). Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.  Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.  Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!  Best regards,  Team EWYL

So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
182 - 12 Dec 2023 10:05AM - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa.

Set Up Columns:  Create three columns with the following headers: ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes)."" Record Your Activities:  Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. In the ""Activity"" column, list each activity separately. Specify Days:  In the ""Day of the Week"" column, record the corresponding day for each activity. Log Time:  In the ""Time Spent"" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity. Calculate Average Time:  Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week. Reflect:  In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent. Save and Submit:  Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx""). Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

150 - 11 Dec 2023 10:00PM - +263 78 087 8756: *4.What are accounting standards and why are they mandatory?*  Accounting standards are the rules and regulations that govern the preparation of financial statements. These standards are developed by various standard-setting bodies, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States.Accounting standards are mandatory is because they help to protect the public interest. Without standards, companies could potentially manipulate their financial information to make their performance look better than it really is. This could lead to investors and creditors making decisions based on false or misleading information. Additionally, if a company's financial statements are not prepared in accordance with standards, it could lead to unfair practices such as tax evasion. So, in a way, standards help to protect the public by ensuring that companies are following the rules and disclosing accurate information.  They ensure consistency and comparability in financial reporting. Without these standards, businesses could use different methods of reporting their financial information, making it difficult to compare and analyze the financial health of different companies. By requiring businesses to follow the same standards, accounting standards help to create a level playing field and promote transparency in the market.
151 - 11 Dec 2023 10:12PM - +263 78 087 8756: *5.Differentiate between Accounting and Auditing* Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, they actually have distinct meanings. Accounting refers to the process of recording and reporting financial transactions, whereas auditing is the independent examination of those transactions and reports. In other words, accountants are responsible for preparing financial statements, while auditors are responsible for reviewing those statements and ensuring that they are accurate and in compliance with relevant standards. So, accounting is more of a bookkeeping function, while auditing is more of a quality control function.  So, the main purpose of accounting is to provide information that is useful in making economic decisions, while the main purpose of auditing is to provide assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatements. Accounting is also more forward-looking, as it focuses on future transactions and events, while auditing is more backward-looking, as it focuses on past transactions and events.Auditing uses a reasonable assurance standard, meaning that there is a high degree of confidence that the financial statements are accurate and complete. Auditing also goes a step further by looking for fraud and irregularities in the financial statements. <This message was edited>

Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
136 - 12 Dec 2023 05:09PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?",No,No

However, I was able to go through the message you shared above, and I completely understand that you have financial challenges rest assured I am here to help you walk through that same challenge. If you are facing any concerns there would obviously be a solution to it as well. But before we discuss this solution you know you mentioned that you were looking forward to the Edoofa Scholarship program but now you feel that you are supposed to make the payment hence I would like you to please elaborate a bit. May I also know when you enrolled in the Edoofa scholarship program were you not aware of the cost involved for Nicole's higher education abroad?

When Nicole explained at first I thought Edoofa is a scholarship helping with the University fees only that is a certain amount.  I was only aware when you were explaining but looks like the whole amount it's me paying it, so problem is the money, I would love her to study but money is a problem to me, for me to pay registration and University I struggle for it sir,

589 - 12 Dec 2023 01:29PM - +263 78 056 8487: Good afternoon Ms. Kirti.  So is the registration fee for the university not refundable?
590 - 12 Dec 2023 09:17PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening and Nicole,  I hope this message finds you all in good health. Thank you for your kind inquiries; I'm doing well, and I appreciate you sharing the challenges you're facing.  I'd like to gently remind you that when Nicole's counseling sessions began, our counselors provided a comprehensive breakdown of all the costs involved. This is why we emphasize the importance of parents being added to our group, to ensure they are fully informed about the expenses. I recall that you were present in the group discussions, and at that time, you indicated your understanding of the financial requirements before we initiated Nicole's application process. There were no concerns raised by you at that stage.
591 - 12 Dec 2023 09:18PM - Kirti Edoofa: Similarly, when we presented the offer letter, there was no mention of financial concerns during our conversations, and you proceeded with paying Nicole's registration fee some part. While I completely empathize with financial constraints, I'm trying to understand what has changed suddenly. As mentioned above by @263780568487 you seemed prepared and willing to meet the financial requirements earlier. Could you please share what unexpected challenges have arisen now that are impacting your ability to fulfill these commitments? Your insights will help me understand your situation better and explore how we might be able to assist further.
592 - 12 Dec 2023 09:52PM - +263 78 056 8487: My mother is a teacher. She's currently the only working parent. And she was willing and eager to meet the higher education's demands. But along the way my mother neglected a few of her duties while trying to put me first. She even went to the extent of borrowing money from family and friends which needs to be returned. I'm not happy about the stress my mother is facing so I just decided to pull out from the scholarship program. Not because I don't want it anymore but because it's not worth seeing my mother under so much stress. Because currently she only has R500 in her bank and she's currently at home since schools closed. And yes, when we started the program everything was clearly explained and we clearly understood. We just didn't expect things to not go our way. We sincerely apologies.  From a professional level I know my reason is not convincing enough. But that's the truth.
593 - 12 Dec 2023 10:07PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your particular concern with me Nicole, I have taken note of it as well however, as it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.

And that is why I suggested you a flexible payment plan above.
448 - 11 Dec 2023 09:32PM - Kirti Edoofa: You can respond to the message above by tomorrow, since it is past our available hours in that case, we will not be able to continue with our discussion which will lead to a broken discussion so let us reconnect tomorrow and start with our discussion. I hope you will be available. Have a great night ahead.

Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday.  Therefore, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can start our discussion?

264 - 12 Dec 2023 01:57PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, your deadline for the registration fee was the 28th of November 2023, however, you shared your financial concerns with me, which I very well understood and was able to have a discussion with the academic board about the same and they agreed to give you an extension till the 15th of December 2023 for the first part which is $300, and I was wanting to have this discussion for so long but, you were not available.
265 - 12 Dec 2023 01:59PM - +263 71 889 2415: I am so sorry mam we were discussing the same issue here at home as a family
266 - 12 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Kirti Edoofa: And may I know how did your discussion went as a family?
267 - 12 Dec 2023 02:26PM - +263 71 889 2415: The conclusion was that the money is not available as per the said dates but later. The conclusion was centred on the fact that the family get the money from farming and later sell the products to the government in early March of next year
268 - 12 Dec 2023 07:31PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I completely understand that financial concerns can be a challenge. However, March will be a long time, since the universities have to be fair with all the students. I can have a conversation with the university and help you process your admission as a regular application by 01st March 2024, but that would mean letting go of the Endowment Grant of $150, and you will need to deposit $750. If you are okay with this, I can certainly take another step to help you out. However, sir, that cannot be done if you do not understand the importance of these due dates.
269 - 12 Dec 2023 07:35PM - +263 71 889 2415: That would be an excellent step mam Thank you in advance
270 - 12 Dec 2023 07:41PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263718892415 You are welcome, However, I'm curious to know if you could kindly explain your concerns since you would be losing all the endowment benefits? I'd like to understand your perspective better.
271 - 12 Dec 2023 07:57PM - +263 71 889 2415: During this period money is difficult to get here in Zimbabwe. No parent will be able to release such amount.
272 - 12 Dec 2023 09:00PM - Kirti Edoofa: I fully appreciate your perspective on this matter. Indeed, many parents face similar challenges, yet they manage to progress with their child's education through our assistance and clear communication. Unfortunately, we have been unable to engage in such discussions due to a lack of response from your end.

Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as I was occupied with some work-related meetings with the university officials however, I am here to share an amazing update with you, as I was able to have a discussion with the academic board and took the opportunity to discuss the case with the university officials as well and I am happy to let you know that your extension has been approved for the $150 before the 28th of December. Please let me know once you have acknowledged the message. <This message was edited>

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail, once done share the screenshot with me.

240 - 12 Dec 2023 08:55PM - Kirti Edoofa: I apologize, but it's important to note that when dealing with the Academic Board, maintaining a level of formality is essential. Communicating via email is the most appropriate method in this context, as it not only adheres to the expected decorum but also demonstrates your professionalism to them.

8 - 12 Dec 2023 12:06PM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Beauty Mundia, Mr and Mrs Mundia!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  I am here to discuss the application of Nchimunya  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
9 - 12 Dec 2023 12:08PM - +260 97 0269699: Good morning sir
10 - 12 Dec 2023 12:11PM - +260 97 0269699: All I know about Edoofa is that it's a sponsorship program that tries to help us in our academic life especially African countries....it gives us an opportunity to study in India at high institutions.
11 - 12 Dec 2023 12:23PM - +260 97 0269699: It is also a merit based program.... and that Edoofa works with private institutions in India that offer scholarships
12 - 12 Dec 2023 01:14PM - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
13 - 12 Dec 2023 01:14PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
14 - 12 Dec 2023 01:14PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15 - 12 Dec 2023 01:14PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16 - 12 Dec 2023 01:14PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
25 - 12 Dec 2023 01:43PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Beauty, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
26 - 12 Dec 2023 01:43PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27 - 12 Dec 2023 01:49PM - +260 97 0269699: To be honest with you sir...I have the first one but as for the second one my dad is having a meeting today and he is the one who was added to this group... but he is aware of this he will join us shortly..... otherwise I have them <This message was edited>

39 - 12 Dec 2023 03:53PM - +260 97 1873656: Very interesting dialogue here
40 - 12 Dec 2023 04:29PM - Gurvinder: Beauty, your interest in Agribusiness and Software Engineering reflects a forward-thinking approach and an understanding of the evolving landscape in both fields.  Your inclination towards Agribusiness, especially considering the government's encouragement and the growing potential in agriculture-related ventures, demonstrates a keen awareness of opportunities in this sector. It's great that you recognize the potential for self-employment and entrepreneurship within agriculture, enabling individuals to create their own path rather than relying solely on governmental employment.  Additionally, your interest in Software Engineering aligns with the rapidly evolving technological landscape. Recognizing the significance of technology in our daily lives and the increasing reliance on computers, pursuing a career in Software Engineering is a fantastic way to be at the forefront of this technological advancement.
41 - 12 Dec 2023 04:29PM - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in these fields?
42 - 12 Dec 2023 04:35PM - +260 97 0269699: Not really but my elder cousin is studying something to do with agriculture which is general agriculture

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.  I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

7 - 12 Dec 2023 12:01PM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Chileleko Nunkwe, Mr and Mrs Nunkwe!  *I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*  I am here to discuss the application of Nchimunya  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
8 - 12 Dec 2023 12:04PM - +260 97 5232462: Good morning, our daughter is Chileleko not Nchimunya. We have no idea who Nchimunya is.
9 - 12 Dec 2023 12:12PM - +260 97 5232462: Good morning Mr Singh, regarding the question, Edoofa scholarship program in India is an organisation that has been established to assist young people by providing affordable, employable and high quality and excellent education.
10 - 12 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
11 - 12 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
12 - 12 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
13 - 12 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14 - 12 Dec 2023 01:08PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
20 - 12 Dec 2023 01:31PM - +260 97 5232462: Yes
21 - 12 Dec 2023 01:45PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Nunkwe, as we start your daughter's counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. <This message was edited>
22 - 12 Dec 2023 01:45PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

13 - 12 Dec 2023 01:27PM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
14 - 12 Dec 2023 01:27PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15 - 12 Dec 2023 01:27PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
8 - 12 Dec 2023 10:44AM - +263 71 415 8096: Ok thank you Mr Gurvinder
9 - 12 Dec 2023 11:06AM - Gurvinder: Alright, so Thelma, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Noah, is that correct?
10 - 12 Dec 2023 11:30AM - +263 71 415 8096: Yes it correct Mr Gurvinder

16 - 12 Dec 2023 01:28PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17 - 12 Dec 2023 01:28PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20 - 12 Dec 2023 01:47PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Thelma, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
21 - 12 Dec 2023 01:47PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
22 - 12 Dec 2023 01:49PM - +263 71 415 8096: Ok sir
23 - 12 Dec 2023 01:50PM - +263 71 415 8096: Yes sir I think so

However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
197 - 11 Dec 2023 07:34PM - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*.  Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

202 - 12 Dec 2023 10:32AM - Gurvinder: Cleopatra, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
203 - 12 Dec 2023 10:50AM - +263 71 821 0789: That will be 1500 if it's  5univerties
204 - 12 Dec 2023 12:31PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Cleopatra, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

202 - 12 Dec 2023 10:32AM - Gurvinder: Cleopatra, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
203 - 12 Dec 2023 10:50AM - +263 71 821 0789: That will be 1500 if it's  5univerties
204 - 12 Dec 2023 12:31PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Cleopatra, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don’t you think so?

106 - 12 Dec 2023 01:13PM - Gurvinder: Delight, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
107 - 12 Dec 2023 01:23PM - +263 77 916 5512: Thank you
108 - 12 Dec 2023 01:38PM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
109 - 12 Dec 2023 01:38PM - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
110 - 12 Dec 2023 01:38PM - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - _Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*. _How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi* _How to be industry ready before graduating?

120 - 12 Dec 2023 01:38PM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
121 - 12 Dec 2023 01:38PM - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
122 - 12 Dec 2023 01:44PM - +263 77 916 5512: That will actually benefit me a lot
123 - 12 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Delight, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
124 - 12 Dec 2023 02:43PM - +263 77 916 5512: That's understandable . Thank you
125 - 12 Dec 2023 03:08PM - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

17 - 12 Dec 2023 01:53PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
18 - 12 Dec 2023 01:54PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22 - 12 Dec 2023 01:54PM - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

25 - 12 Dec 2023 01:54PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
26 - 12 Dec 2023 01:59PM - +260 96 7154080: Yes sir, that is true .
27 - 12 Dec 2023 02:28PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Emmanuel, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
28 - 12 Dec 2023 02:28PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29 - 12 Dec 2023 02:32PM - +260 96 7154080: Yes, I have what it takes.
30 - 12 Dec 2023 02:52PM - Gurvinder: Now Emmanuel, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent’s highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

62 - 12 Dec 2023 04:27PM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
63 - 12 Dec 2023 04:27PM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19 - 12 Dec 2023 12:49PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

14 - 12 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15 - 12 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16 - 12 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1.

Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
20 - 12 Dec 2023 02:29PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24 - 12 Dec 2023 01:48PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
25 - 12 Dec 2023 01:48PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
26 - 12 Dec 2023 02:09PM - +263 78 142 0001: Oka yha he once told me about that tooo

29 - 12 Dec 2023 02:32PM - Gurvinder: Please be patient, as everything related to this will be addressed ahead in counselling session.
30 - 12 Dec 2023 02:33PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Larndrone, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
31 - 12 Dec 2023 02:33PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
32 - 12 Dec 2023 06:27PM - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*.  Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

139 - 12 Dec 2023 10:28AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
140 - 12 Dec 2023 10:28AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
141 - 12 Dec 2023 10:28AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
144 - 12 Dec 2023 10:35AM - +263 71 443 3551: Okay

Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.

117 - 12 Dec 2023 02:58PM - Gurvinder: I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like  1. Bachelors in  Pharmacy 2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy 3. Bachelors in Optometry 4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology 5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics 6. Bachelor of Science in BioChemistry 7. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology  These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students. <This message was edited>

Bachelors in  Pharmacy 2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy 3. Bachelors in Optometry 4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology 5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics 6. Bachelor of Science in BioChemistry 7. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology  These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students. <This message was edited>

181 - 12 Dec 2023 09:08AM - +263 77 583 1671: Good morning sir
182 - 12 Dec 2023 09:08AM - +263 77 583 1671: It is true that education is the most powerful weapon
183 - 12 Dec 2023 10:00AM - Gurvinder: Alright Ropafadzo, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
184 - 12 Dec 2023 12:13PM - +263 77 583 1671: Yes
185 - 12 Dec 2023 01:12PM - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
186 - 12 Dec 2023 02:07PM - +263 77 583 1671: Yes l did
187 - 12 Dec 2023 02:32PM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
188 - 12 Dec 2023 03:23PM - +263 77 583 1671: Yes
189 - 12 Dec 2023 03:37PM - Gurvinder: Ropafadzo as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

190 - 12 Dec 2023 04:19PM - +263 77 583 1671: $1500_$2500
191 - 12 Dec 2023 04:19PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Ropafadzo, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
196 - 12 Dec 2023 04:47PM - +263 77 583 1671: Yes
197 - 12 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
198 - 12 Dec 2023 04:56PM - Gurvinder: Ropafadzo basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
199 - 12 Dec 2023 04:56PM - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
200 - 12 Dec 2023 05:00PM - +263 77 583 1671: Yes l am
201 - 12 Dec 2023 05:16PM - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.  Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
202 - 12 Dec 2023 05:23PM - +263 77 583 1671: Yes
203 - 12 Dec 2023 05:29PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
204 - 12 Dec 2023 05:29PM - Gurvinder: Alright Ropafadzo, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.  Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.

Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

26 - 12 Dec 2023 09:44AM - +263 77 372 3003: I have learnt a lot from Munashe, firstly considering our my background here in Zimbabwe l have noticed that getting a scholarship at your institution will be a great opportunity for me as they offer quality education. Not only do you offer quality education but quality life skills. It has always been my passion to know more or study different cultures"" diversity"" and with the help of Edoofa l can aquire some of those skills
27 - 12 Dec 2023 10:14AM - +263 77 372 3003: According to my research l also came across this program where one has to earn money while learning which is also good for us as students because we don't just have to learn theory without applying it to practical like what most universities in Zimbabwe are doing. So it is what also differs Edoofa from other institutions as it teaches us theory and also teach is to apply what we learn into practice

30 - 12 Dec 2023 10:44AM - Gurvinder: Let me give you a brief about the program myself.
31 - 12 Dec 2023 10:45AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
32 - 12 Dec 2023 10:45AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
33 - 12 Dec 2023 10:45AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

34 - 12 Dec 2023 10:45AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
35 - 12 Dec 2023 11:03AM - +263 77 372 3003: Exactly, l want to help reduce the burden of my parents
36 - 12 Dec 2023 11:10AM - +263 77 372 3003: Yeah it will be a great opportunity for me if l get this scholarship as it will help me gain quality skills and education as well as helping my parents reduce their financial burden
37 - 12 Dec 2023 12:48PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Ndhlovu, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
38 - 12 Dec 2023 12:48PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
39 - 12 Dec 2023 01:16PM - +263 77 372 3003: Definitely
40 - 12 Dec 2023 01:20PM - +263 77 372 3003: This message was deleted
41 - 12 Dec 2023 01:37PM - Gurvinder: Now Prosper, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3.

37 - 12 Dec 2023 12:48PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Ndhlovu, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
38 - 12 Dec 2023 12:48PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
39 - 12 Dec 2023 01:16PM - +263 77 372 3003: Definitely

192 - 12 Dec 2023 04:04PM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

34 - 11 Dec 2023 08:04PM - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*.  Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

41 - 12 Dec 2023 10:30AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Nyashadzashe, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
42 - 12 Dec 2023 10:30AM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

202 - 12 Dec 2023 01:33PM - Gurvinder: Prig A as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
203 - 12 Dec 2023 01:41PM - +263 77 437 5439: If he applies in five unviversities he will end up with $1 750 just for applying  only

205 - 12 Dec 2023 02:17PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Prig A, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

200 - 12 Dec 2023 12:40PM - +263 77 437 5439: Yes l am ready
201 - 12 Dec 2023 01:10PM - +263 77 344 3262: Yes we are ready
202 - 12 Dec 2023 01:33PM - Gurvinder: Prig A as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

208 - 12 Dec 2023 02:37PM - +263 77 344 3262: We greatly appreciate it and promise to pay the equivalence
209 - 12 Dec 2023 03:06PM - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don’t you think so?

210 - 12 Dec 2023 03:16PM - +263 77 437 5439: Yes l do understand  that Edoofa offers a guarantee  of admission  and scholarship to eligible  students.  So thank you  sir
211 - 12 Dec 2023 03:17PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
212 - 12 Dec 2023 03:17PM - Gurvinder: Prig A basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.  *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
213 - 12 Dec 2023 03:24PM - +263 77 437 5439: Okay l understand  sir these procedures.
243 - 12 Dec 2023 03:53PM - Gurvinder: I'm glad to have been able to assist you with your stage 1 application process. I'll be here tomorrow to continue our progress and guide you further. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance before then.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15 - 12 Dec 2023 01:16PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.  I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

20 - 12 Dec 2023 12:32PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
21 - 12 Dec 2023 12:38PM - +263 78 828 3084: Yes Mr Gurvinder seeing my mom troubling to find money, she is a widow my father died when I was in fourth grade i had to look for something like this for myself

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
24 - 12 Dec 2023 01:21PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a “NO CHANGE” option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.  Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6. outdo A) NO CHANGE B) defeat C) outperform D) outweigh  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE B) can pollute waterways, C) could have polluted waterways, D) has polluted waterway’s,  8.scientists; and A) NO CHANGE B) scientists: and C) scientists, and D) scientists, and,  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed A) where it is now.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!

18 - 12 Dec 2023 12:29PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19 - 12 Dec 2023 12:29PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

20 - 12 Dec 2023 12:29PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
21 - 12 Dec 2023 12:35PM - +263 71 450 5336: Yes it is
22 - 12 Dec 2023 12:36PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Tsitsi, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
23 - 12 Dec 2023 12:36PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24 - 12 Dec 2023 12:40PM - +263 71 450 5336: Yes l do

148 - 12 Dec 2023 10:42AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
149 - 12 Dec 2023 10:43AM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
150 - 12 Dec 2023 10:43AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

152 - 12 Dec 2023 10:43AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
150 - 12 Dec 2023 10:43AM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

152 - 12 Dec 2023 10:43AM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

154 - 12 Dec 2023 12:29PM - Gurvinder: In simple words Tsitsi what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

157 - 12 Dec 2023 01:45PM - +27 71 023 1664: Yeah sure
158 - 12 Dec 2023 02:19PM - Gurvinder: Tsitsi, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

96 - 12 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Harmehak: Alright then Alois, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
97 - 12 Dec 2023 04:15PM - +263 77 461 7198: Maybe I will be someone who is self-esteem and making some money there because my I wish is to work there so that I will help my parents in Zimbabwe
98 - 12 Dec 2023 04:16PM - Harmehak: That is great Alois, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!  Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?

100 - 12 Dec 2023 04:26PM - +263 77 461 7198: In addition some of the students in Zimbabwe who finish their coarse are not going work due lack of jobs in Zimbabwe so that's why I want to study abroad and work there
101 - 12 Dec 2023 04:58PM - Harmehak: You see, Alois, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.  Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
102 - 12 Dec 2023 05:01PM - +263 77 461 7198: You see so it is better for me to study there and work there too
103 - 12 Dec 2023 05:42PM - Harmehak: Indeed, I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Alois.

101 - 12 Dec 2023 04:58PM - Harmehak: You see, Alois, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.  Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
102 - 12 Dec 2023 05:01PM - +263 77 461 7198: You see so it is better for me to study there and work there too
103 - 12 Dec 2023 05:42PM - Harmehak: Indeed, I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Alois.  Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.  *May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?* <This message was edited>

Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:  Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.  Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.  Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.  Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field.

28 - 12 Dec 2023 11:06AM - +263 71 510 9943: Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to the edoofa team for responding to my application.I'm Lungelo Denzil Machekano aged 18. I did both my O and A level at Matopo High school and I'm currently waiting for my A level results.Dedication to school work is my first principle.However, i have learnt that dedication to school work goes with striving for a complete character and discipline so that learning becomes prosperous.All these values made me get flourishing results during my Ordinary level. I'm astonished to have got 5As 4Bs and 2Cs in a science class. I'm interested in the field of medicine or Pathology. One of my strengths is working hard and punctuality to be a great leader in the future. I'm not much of  a sport person but one of my hobbies would be playing darts. I live with my mother who holds a degree in Records and Archives  and  is currently an Archivist  at ministry of health and Child care.I don't have any siblings.

124 - 12 Dec 2023 05:56PM - Harmehak: Denzil, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?
125 - 12 Dec 2023 05:57PM - +263 71 510 9943: I agree
126 - 12 Dec 2023 05:58PM - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Denzil?
127 - 12 Dec 2023 06:13PM - +263 71 510 9943: Yes
128 - 12 Dec 2023 07:32PM - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.  *Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

34 - 12 Dec 2023 10:58AM - Harmehak: So Mrs Serah, now as we proceed ahead with the discussion, I would like to know Faith better as a student,  How she is at school, her interests and hobbies, what exactly she would like to pursue?  Do tag along her A level subject combination and O level results.
35 - 12 Dec 2023 11:06AM - +260 96 8629973: Faith is an 18 year old girl who studied at tarcisia floriana convent secondary boarding school in solwezi for five years till she completed this year. Her academic performance has always been good and impressing there for as a family we are expecting good results from her. Faith is interested in reading books, traveling, singing, and swimming as a sport and also spending time with her family and friends. Faith took English language, mathematics, science, Biology, religious Education, civic education and accounts whilst in school
36 - 12 Dec 2023 11:06AM - +260 96 8629973: And as for the o level results will be released next year February
37 - 12 Dec 2023 11:09AM - +260 96 8629973: She has always talked about wanting to be a surgical doctor since child hood and venturing mostly as a neurological doctor..... Therefore we feel India is the best country which offers medical courses
38 - 12 Dec 2023 11:31AM - Harmehak: That's well expressed Mrs Serah.  It's a pleasure to know more about Faith.  I can see she is a dedicated and a hardworking student.
39 - 12 Dec 2023 11:31AM - Harmehak: Did her science subject include Physics and Chemistry please?
40 - 12 Dec 2023 11:32AM - +260 96 8629973: Yes they did
41 - 12 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Harmehak: Duly noted please

41 - 12 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Harmehak: Duly noted please
42 - 12 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Harmehak: What motivates her to pursue a career in medical field, Mrs Serah?
43 - 12 Dec 2023 11:39AM - +260 96 8629973: Whilst she was young her aunt who's currently a nurse introduced her to the Ben Carson movie and bought her books by him..... She literally encouraged her to be a neurological doctor  like Ben Carson who was of course hard working and God fearing.... She then exposed her to the knowledge of life in the hospital and how she could help save lives of people by not only treating them but encouraging them and beirkind to them.... As we speak now she has been researching a lot about the medical field, downloading apps and books to help her on the the road and seeking more information from experienced medical practitioners
44 - 12 Dec 2023 11:55AM - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing, Mrs Serah.  I can see her aunt had a great impact and she realised she wishes to work in the medical field.  It's good to know that she wishes to do well for others.
45 - 12 Dec 2023 11:56AM - Harmehak: You see, it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:  *1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.  *2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .  *3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.
46 - 12 Dec 2023 11:57AM - Harmehak: But I realize that she wants to do a course that makes you, the parent proud and also align with her passion. So she can go ahead with the courses like:  *1. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology* *2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy* *3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy* *4. Bachelors in Optometry* *5. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology*  These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
47 - 12 Dec 2023 12:16PM - +260 96 8629973: Okey...those will be put into consideration
48 - 12 Dec 2023 12:18PM - +260 96 8629973: I want to know if it's possible for you to help us find a university that offers neurological surgery that is conducive and good for our girl even though it is not sponsorship based",No,No

39 - 12 Dec 2023 11:32AM - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!

39 - 12 Dec 2023 03:48PM - Kunal: Thank you for sharing I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

However, this issue is far more complex and nuanced than it may seem.  First of all, there are many factors that contribute to food insecurity in Africa, including political instability, climate change, and lack of infrastructure.  These factors can make it difficult for farmers to produce enough food to meet the needs of the population.  Additionally, it's important to remember that Africa is a diverse continent with different climates, cultures, and economies.  Some regions of Africa have more fertile land and more efficient farming methods than others.  It's not fair to say that all Africans have poor diets because of inefficient farming methods.  In fact, many African farmers are using innovative techniques to improve their crop yields.  For example, some farmers are using hydroponics, a technique that allows them to grow crops without soil.  Others are using drip irrigation, a method that uses less water than traditional irrigation systems.  These techniques are making it possible for farmers to produce more food with the same amount of land.  In conclusion, it's not accurate to say that Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient.  While it's true that some farmers in Africa face challenges, there are many people who are working hard to improve their farming methods and increase food production.  It's important to remember that Africa is a large and diverse continent, and there is no single solution that will solve all of the food security issues there.  However, with continued innovation and investment in agriculture, it's possible to make progress towards ensuring that all Africans have access to a healthy and nutritious diet.   SECTION 6  My life has been full of challenges, but I have always found a way to overcome them and move forward. The one thing that has always motivated me to keep going is my desire to make a difference in the world. This desire has led me to pursue an education.  When I was growing up, my family faced a lot of financial difficulties. My parents worked very hard to make ends meet, but there were times when we struggled to afford basic necessities like food and clothing. Despite these challenges, I never lost hope. I knew that I wanted to make a better life for myself and my family, and I was determined to succeed. I began to focus on my studies and set goals for myself. I knew that education was the key to a better future, and I was determined to make it happen.I had to go and stay in the rural areas with my grandmother so that I will get cheap education since my parents couldn't afford the fees here in Harare..I did my Olevel staying with my sister under difficult circumstances and I  worked very hard to get the money but i still did not give up and now am waiting for my Alevel results and I'm hoping to continue with my education..  Now I lay ally hope on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and hoping that it will make  my  dream a reality. With this scholarship, I will able to focus on my studies and make a positive impact on the world around me

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.

238 - 11 Dec 2023 06:36PM - +263 78 143 5949: The application will be focused on why  he /she wants that degree or diploma and how it's going to benefit him/her
239 - 11 Dec 2023 06:44PM - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.   This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!  So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it. Now do you understand the importance of SOP?

244 - 12 Dec 2023 01:28PM - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.  How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
245 - 12 Dec 2023 03:31PM - +263 78 143 5949: For SOP that will be $600-$1000 ,
246 - 12 Dec 2023 03:48PM - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000.  So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750.

Why don't you honestly share the real query with me, because there is surely something else which is a matter of concern right now?  Don't be hesitant in sharing what is going on, because if you would not communicate, I am not a God who would understand what is going in your mind without you even sharing it with me?",No,Yes

358 - 11 Dec 2023 05:14PM - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th  or 18th December 2023 for $200 and the 17th  or 18th of January  for the remaining $150. 2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th  or 18th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
359 - 11 Dec 2023 08:43PM - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.  Have a good day ahead. God Bless You!

We are only making advance preparations (and mobilizing the requisite financial commitments) and obtaining the full understanding of the operational system for now, but effectively she will become eligible in 2025.

363 - 12 Dec 2023 01:27PM - Sahil Edoofa: Stacey's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways  1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.  Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself.  This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.  2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels.  3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

388 - 12 Dec 2023 01:43PM - Sahil Edoofa: Do you have any question for me from the acceptance letter ?
389 - 12 Dec 2023 01:44PM - +27 78 327 2010: For now we dont have but if we have chalenges in the payments whom can we talk to
390 - 12 Dec 2023 01:45PM - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
391 - 12 Dec 2023 01:46PM - +27 78 327 2010: Yes
392 - 12 Dec 2023 02:33PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
393 - 12 Dec 2023 02:33PM - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

My father works as a refrigerator and air conditioner technician with his job and the help of my guidance and counseling teacher who later paid for my form 6 fees since my dad was not able to due to the illness and death of my mother which required a lot of money, I was able to learn at Kwekwe High School from form 1 up to 6. I passed my ordinary level with 6 out of 9 subjects and proceeded for A level. I took the combination of three sciences subjects which were puremathatics, biology and chemistry. As of now I'm waiting for my results. My hobby is singing and I'm interested in helping myself and others keep their health by staying fit and exercising. My ambition is to become a doctor, specifically a surgeon my family inspired me to have this dream it all started when I used to give my grandma her medications and also when I used to check my parent's blood pressure and advising them to take the proper diet and exercises, if anyone of my family members were sick i would always help them in any way possible and this all led up to me having this dream to one day help the sick.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

301 - 12 Dec 2023 05:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
302 - 12 Dec 2023 05:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
303 - 12 Dec 2023 05:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

305 - 12 Dec 2023 05:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 19th or 20th December 2023 for $200 and the 19th or 20th of January for the remaining $150. 2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 19th or 20th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
312 - 12 Dec 2023 06:43PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Considering that you have provided comprehensive answers to all the inquiries, the next step in the process involves scheduling a video call with the Program Director. Once I submit the evaluation report for the application of Laiza, I will promptly arrange suitable time slots for the video call. Could I inquire about your availability for tomorrow to proceed with this arrangement?
313 - 12 Dec 2023 06:51PM - +263 78 701 0955: Tomorrow at 12
314 - 12 Dec 2023 06:59PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your interview has been scheduled for 12:00 P.M. CAT Time tomorrow. Please set an alarm to ensure you're available at least 10 minutes before the call. Also, make the necessary preparations for a video call. Please note that the director will only conduct the interview once, and missing it may lead to application cancellation. Best of luck! Additionally, we'll be sharing a letter from our Honorable Director, Mr. Abhinav Gupta, with parents before the interview. Please make sure to go through the document, and as parents, acknowledge it using a voice note.

You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
134 - 12 Dec 2023 11:06AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics
135 - 12 Dec 2023 11:06AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
136 - 12 Dec 2023 11:07AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child?
137 - 12 Dec 2023 11:20AM - +263 77 821 9098: Yes it's important to learn   more as you said
138 - 12 Dec 2023 12:06PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
139 - 12 Dec 2023 12:06PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
140 - 12 Dec 2023 12:06PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
141 - 12 Dec 2023 12:07PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

172 - 12 Dec 2023 03:58PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how you feel about Leah studying abroad?
173 - 12 Dec 2023 04:09PM - +263 77 821 9098: As a parent, I would be both excited and nervous about my child studying abroad. I would be excited because I know that it could be a life-changing experience for them, and I want them to have every opportunity to grow and learn. But I would also be nervous because I would worry about their safety and well-being while they're so far away. I would do my best to balance those feelings and make sure my child knew I was there for them, no matter what.
174 - 12 Dec 2023 04:33PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can conclude that she is diligent and possesses extreme valor. She will surely prove her mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, as I have mentioned before, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that she will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate her career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling her to independently support her family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for her parents!
175 - 12 Dec 2023 04:33PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
176 - 12 Dec 2023 05:17PM - +263 77 821 9098: Looking forward to it
177 - 12 Dec 2023 05:31PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?

259 - 12 Dec 2023 02:03PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
260 - 12 Dec 2023 02:04PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

116 - 12 Dec 2023 12:05PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
117 - 12 Dec 2023 05:40PM - +263 77 882 1285: Yes , I'm definitely interested in studying in India . I think that studying in India would help me advance in my career by giving me the opportunity to learn from some of the best legal minds in the world.

In particular, I think that the focus on critical thinking and problem solving would be especially beneficial for me.
118 - 12 Dec 2023 05:46PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
119 - 12 Dec 2023 07:23PM - +263 77 882 1285: Edoofa's commitment to quality education is impressive and commendable. I know that the cost  of higher education for international students can be quite expensive, especially if they do not have access to scholarships. In some cases , the cost of tuition, living expenses and other fees can add up to a significant amount of money. This can be a significant barrier for many international students who may not have the financial means to pay for such large sum of money.
120 - 12 Dec 2023 07:32PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Sharmaine! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

158 - 12 Dec 2023 08:16PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
159 - 12 Dec 2023 08:24PM - +263 77 882 1285: Yes , I really appreciate it . I will do my very best to reduce the financial pressure on my parents.
160 - 12 Dec 2023 08:43PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
161 - 12 Dec 2023 08:43PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
162 - 12 Dec 2023 08:43PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
163 - 12 Dec 2023 08:48PM - +263 77 882 1285: I appreciate all of them , Edoofa is amazing.
164 - 12 Dec 2023 08:48PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Sharmaine! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
169 - 12 Dec 2023 09:03PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
170 - 12 Dec 2023 09:07PM - +263 77 882 1285: Yes , that sounds great that I will be able to support my family .
171 - 12 Dec 2023 09:07PM - +263 77 882 1285: Ok sir
172 - 12 Dec 2023 09:08PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
173 - 12 Dec 2023 09:11PM - +263 77 882 1285: Yes , that's all I think.
174 - 12 Dec 2023 09:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
175 - 12 Dec 2023 09:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
176 - 12 Dec 2023 09:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
177 - 12 Dec 2023 09:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your  - *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* - *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* - *Earn While You Learn Program and training* - *University sessions and interactions* - *A guaranteed scholarship seat* - *Visa Documentation Assistance* - *The Foster and Care throughout your course*

151 - 12 Dec 2023 11:08AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tadiwanashe! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

153 - 12 Dec 2023 11:08AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
154 - 12 Dec 2023 11:23AM - +263 78 131 8978: Yes it is affordable
155 - 12 Dec 2023 12:19PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tadiwanashe. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.  Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
156 - 12 Dec 2023 12:32PM - +263 78 131 8978: Well l do not have any idea about how its done
157 - 12 Dec 2023 12:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tadiwanashe. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
158 - 12 Dec 2023 12:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.  The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
159 - 12 Dec 2023 12:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: - The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are: Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

160 - 12 Dec 2023 12:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics
161 - 12 Dec 2023 12:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating?

202 - 12 Dec 2023 03:39PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

204 - 12 Dec 2023 03:39PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Which simply means, if you are found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receives Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, you will be receiving a time span of 7 days to pay the enrollment of payable amount of $350
205 - 12 Dec 2023 03:39PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your  - *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* - *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* - *Earn While You Learn Program and training* - *University sessions and interactions* - *A guaranteed scholarship seat* - *Visa Documentation Assistance* - *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
206 - 12 Dec 2023 04:07PM - +263 78 131 8978: Now l.have more understanding on that thank you for that
207 - 12 Dec 2023 04:31PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
208 - 12 Dec 2023 04:31PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
209 - 12 Dec 2023 06:32PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
210 - 12 Dec 2023 07:14PM - +263 78 131 8978: Yes we are still connected

282 - 12 Dec 2023 10:43AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

Does Edoofa help in buying the air tickets for enrolling students 5. Does Edoofa offer job opportunity in India after finishing with the program? 6. Do Edoofa offer employment oppotunities during learning to reduce what l must pay in fees  Thanks, waiting for your answers in details

161 - 12 Dec 2023 11:45AM - Shubham Madhwal: OR As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
162 - 12 Dec 2023 11:56AM - +263 77 294 4709: We do not know sir and tht is the reason why we are asking
163 - 12 Dec 2023 12:42PM - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
164 - 12 Dec 2023 12:42PM - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

167 - 12 Dec 2023 12:43PM - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.",No,Yes

Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings.

This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1.

What is the name of the course that *@263786152641* would be studying through the Edoofa Program?  2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?  3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?  5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?  6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.  7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
265 - 12 Dec 2023 01:21PM - +263 78 615 2641: 1. I will be studying B.Sc. Computer Science  2. I will be studying in India  3.The average cost of education in India without scholarship is between $6000-$8000 annually  4. After being found eligible for the Scholarship i will then be paying between $2000-$3000  5. Enrollment fee is $350 which is to be paid in 7 days, there is an option to pay 200$ within a 7 day dead line then the other 150 after 30 days due to economic constraints  6.The Earn While You Earn Program(EWYL) looks at providing students with relevant expirience within their areas of extertise/areas of study, giving them opportunities to expirience how it feels to be on the field enhancing their education as they do not only acquire theoretical knowledge but also gain practical skills, it does not only provide students with field experience but it also gives them an opportunity to cater for their financial needs during the course of their scholarship through earning scholarship credits.  7.

Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!  You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

436 - 12 Dec 2023 09:31AM - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
437 - 12 Dec 2023 09:36AM - +263 78 204 5981: Mode number 2
438 - 12 Dec 2023 09:38AM - Shubham Madhwal: This message was deleted
439 - 12 Dec 2023 09:38AM - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

440 - 12 Dec 2023 09:38AM - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
441 - 12 Dec 2023 09:38AM - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  BRANCH: Mutare  ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738

451 - 12 Dec 2023 02:04PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me share with you the payment deadlines for the same:  1. *Since you are prepared with $100, You can pay the first initial $100 by tomorrow i.e. 13th of December 2023, before 12:00 PM CAT*  2. You can pay the next $100 before the 26th of December 2023.  3. And the remaining $189 (Including the Transaction charges) by the 20th of January 2023  This option will provide you nearly 40 days to pay Tanaka's enrollment fees.

101 - 12 Dec 2023 02:30PM - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,  However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.  So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
102 - 12 Dec 2023 02:31PM - +260 97 9371972: Very much sir
128 - 12 Dec 2023 03:48PM - +260 97 9371972: How does one get help in terms of fees. More especially those who do not have enough money
129 - 12 Dec 2023 03:52PM - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
130 - 12 Dec 2023 03:54PM - +260 97 9371972: Okay
131 - 12 Dec 2023 03:58PM - Shubham Madhwal: Before moving on ahead, Do you have any questions regarding the information shared with you so far?
132 - 12 Dec 2023 03:58PM - +260 97 9371972: Does the program help the students to have the required jobs
133 - 12 Dec 2023 04:14PM - Shubham Madhwal: In the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!  You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
134 - 12 Dec 2023 04:38PM - +260 97 9371972: Okay thanks

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a “NO CHANGE” option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.

15 - 12 Dec 2023 12:56PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
16 - 12 Dec 2023 12:56PM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

37 - 11 Dec 2023 12:35PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!  You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

193 - 12 Dec 2023 02:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
194 - 12 Dec 2023 02:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

73 - 12 Dec 2023 12:41PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

83 - 12 Dec 2023 12:19PM - Tushti: Fortune, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
84 - 12 Dec 2023 12:19PM - Tushti: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are   1. Bachelor in Pharmacy  2. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering  3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology  4. Bachelor of Technology in Biotechnology Engineering  5. Bachelor of Science in Optometry

56 - 12 Dec 2023 02:15PM - Tushti: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course  First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.  Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.  Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:  *Production Engineering* *Industrial Engineering* *Manufacturing Engineering* *Automobile Engineering* *Artificial Intelligence*  The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.  *Mechanics*  Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine  *Mechatronics and Robotics*  Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.  Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).  Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.  *Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*  Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.  Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.  *Design and drafting*  Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.  Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.  Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
