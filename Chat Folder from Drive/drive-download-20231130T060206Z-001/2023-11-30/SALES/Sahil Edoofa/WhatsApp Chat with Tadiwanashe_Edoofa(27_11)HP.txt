So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
27/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Yes I get to know it from Munyaradzi........Edoofa Scholarship is a program which offers help for young people to make their dreams come true by acquiring knowledge from their programs of their choice
27/11/23, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Tadiwanashe, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/11/23, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

27/11/23, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
27/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Yes it is indeed true
27/11/23, 5:16 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Tadiwanashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Lighthouse college charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
27/11/23, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.* <This message was edited>

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
28/11/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 829 9265: Yes
28/11/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Well received Tadiwanashe, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

28/11/23, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Well Tadiwanashe, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
28/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Yes it is indeed a life changing decision because you get to acquire knowledge based on International standard not at National level and there will be job opportunities all over the world
28/11/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: That's well put across, Tadiwanashe.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
28/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Yes I am mentally prepared
28/11/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Tadiwanashe,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
28/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Yes my family members are aware and they are willing to support me
28/11/23, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Who would be the one supporting you financially and what profession they are in?
28/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 829 9265: My Father is the one who will be me and I already mentioned his profession above
28/11/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
28/11/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Okay .......yes I am confident
28/11/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: That's great
28/11/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Forensic accounting?
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 829 9265: I got 6 B's and 1 C on my O level results and my combination for A Level -Mathematics, Accounting and Computer Science

Since I was in form 2 I have always told myself that I want to Study Accounting and as time moves on I searched for an Accounting degree which is in line with our technology and time frame and I found that there is Forensic Accounting. I chose that because I also do Computer Science which will help me in that program of Forensic Accounting , and it is a program which will help me in techniques like fraud detection ,Fraud prevention and ensures that fraud remedial actions are implemented
28/11/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted and well expressed Tadiwanashe.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
28/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 829 9265: India is one of the countries which offers the best higher Education in the world from what I have researched and been told , I have people I know who have learned there and are now becoming successful in life and are encouraging me to study there  , I also have a friend of mine called Tadiwa who is a girl who lives in the same area with me who fled to India this year for her higher education
28/11/23, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: Amazing knowledge
28/11/23, 4:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

28/11/23, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: Did you find the resources interesting, Tadiwanashe?
28/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Yes I found them interesting and encouraging
28/11/23, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Tadiwanashe 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
28/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Not at all
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Well understood Ms Harmehak
28/11/23, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/11/23, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
28/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 829 9265: That is a good idea it will also help us to afford for the higher Education and from your saying the Earn While Learn program is also good because it also reduces the money
28/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
28/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

28/11/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Well understood
28/11/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Okay well understood Ms Harmehak
28/11/23, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Yes I can see it
28/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 829 9265: That's amazing
28/11/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
28/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Yes I am
28/11/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwanashe, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
28/11/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 829 9265: $2250
28/11/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/11/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwanashe, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 78 829 9265: That's also what i think
28/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
28/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Well understood
28/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
28/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
28/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
28/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Understood
28/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
28/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
28/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

28/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
28/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
28/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Well understood
28/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth too.
28/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 829 9265: Okay let me do so
28/11/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
28/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 829 9265: She is not available at the moment but I will get in touch with her
28/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: Surely Tadiwanashe.
28/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
28/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
28/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
