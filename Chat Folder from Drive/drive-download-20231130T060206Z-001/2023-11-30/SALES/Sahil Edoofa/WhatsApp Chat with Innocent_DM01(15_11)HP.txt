15/11/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Veronica before we proceed, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/11/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
15/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Wonderful
15/11/23, 5:05 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!

I believe you must be aware that we are proudly associated with Daramombe high school as well?

We do have students currently in India and who would be coming to India next year from the school.
15/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Yes am aware
15/11/23, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that.
15/11/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Mrs Veronica, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mr Kenneth better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
15/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Ok thank you. My name is Veronica Shoriwa am 40 years of age . I am a primary school teacher by profession but not yet working due to lack of employment. I am married to Kenneth Mpala, he is a driver and we were blessed with three kids.Innocent is our first born.
I understood that education is the key to sucess that why I support my child with everything I have. I also know that an educated child adds value to the community and is never a burden to the parents or the community.
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Mrs Veronica, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.
15/11/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your thoughts on the importance of education. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Thank you
15/11/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Thank you
15/11/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Veronica, I would like to know Innocent better as a student.

How he is at school, his interests and hobbies?

Along with anything that you would like to share about him.
15/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Ok, Innocent is a boy aged 18. He is in form 5 at Daramombe high school. Innocent is taking science subjects at A level these are computer science, mathematics and physics. He is a well mannered boy who likes singing. I say well mannered because I never heard any complaints about him from school.His ambition is to be an engineer.Innocent is more interested in making things happen like when he is at home most of his time he is either on the laptop or fixing broken things like radios, stoves, torches etc.
15/11/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Surely seems to be a hardworking and a dedicated student, Mrs Veronica.

It's great to know more about him.
15/11/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
15/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 247 1226: I am confident he will pass with flying colors
15/11/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 247 1226: If God permits
15/11/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
15/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Veronica, you mentioned his ambition of becoming an engineer!

May I know which field is he intrigued towards?
15/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Am sorry I forgot the name he always talk about ...as for me am clueless when it comes to carreer guidance ...but it involves the use of computers
15/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Sorry am trying harder to remember
15/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Software engineering if not mistaken
15/11/23, 6:11 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand please.

15/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 247 1226: This is wonderful.. thank you for the information
15/11/23, 6:40 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mrs Veronica.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
15/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Not familiar with the cost, may you please shade some light on this
15/11/23, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.
15/11/23, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Ok ok
15/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 78 247 1226: What about the scholarships are they still available.
15/11/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, we are in the discussion for same itself.
15/11/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
15/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 247 1226: I like this very much..it makes it easier for us
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words.
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Veronica, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
15/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 247 1226: I agree
15/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mrs Veronica?
15/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Yes
15/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
15/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
15/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

15/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Ok I understand
15/11/23, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful.
15/11/23, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Network problem
15/11/23, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Mrs Veronica.
15/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Yes but the pictures are not downloaded yet
15/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please,

You can go through then once you are in a stable network.
15/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage.*

I wish you a blessed evening ahead. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 8:53 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same, I would also be sharing a video for you to learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.
15/11/23, 8:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
16/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 247 1226: Good morning how are you
16/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 247 1226: We can start
16/11/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: I am doing well, Mrs Veronica,

How are you doing today?
16/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 247 1226: Am fine thank you
16/11/23, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Have you been able to follow the discussion so far please?
16/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 247 1226: Yes I have read everything except for the videos there are not yet downloaded
16/11/23, 9:36 am - Harmehak: I do understand please.
16/11/23, 9:37 am - Harmehak: So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. 
The discussion would be concluded itself in 10-15 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 247 1226: Ok
16/11/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Mrs Veronica, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
16/11/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/11/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 247 1226: $1500 more
16/11/23, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/11/23, 9:44 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/11/23, 9:44 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Mrs Veronica, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 247 1226: Yes I think so
16/11/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/11/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
16/11/23, 9:49 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 247 1226: I understand
16/11/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
16/11/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
16/11/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 247 1226: Ok
16/11/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
16/11/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 247 1226: Yes I understand
16/11/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/11/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/11/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
16/11/23, 9:58 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 78 247 1226: Ok
16/11/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
16/11/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

16/11/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 247 1226: Thanks will contact her
16/11/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Surely, Mrs Veronica
16/11/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: So far would you like to ask anything?
16/11/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 247 1226: My child completes A level next year..do I have to apply this year or next year
16/11/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: His application would be considered now itself as this would help him start earning and work under the Earn While You Learn Program.

This would help you and him have a better clarity regarding the process and side by also earn credits.

The Program Director would be sharing a thorough financial plan with you during the interview as well
16/11/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 247 1226: Ok
16/11/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 247 1226: Wonderful
16/11/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Anything else please, Mrs Veronica?
16/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 247 1226: I didn't I understand the issue of Visa ..do I pay for the Visa and how much is it
16/11/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: It's a one time fee of $83 itself which is not to be paid anytime soon.
16/11/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 247 1226: Ok so altogether how much is needed before he goes to india
16/11/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: These would be the fee itself like we discussed which would include his tuition fee, etc.

The admissions team would be thoroughly in touch with you once Innocent has been accepted into the program.

They guide you throughout the process.

16/11/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 247 1226: Ok
16/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 247 1226: Thank you
16/11/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
16/11/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

20/11/23, 12:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Afternoon, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Good afternoon to you too..we can start now thanks
20/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 247 1226: As I have said I was waiting for Innocent's father to come on weekend.He came and we discussed the issue, he was so happy to know that his son have an opportunity to study abroad.The only problem we are facing right now is money he is not yet paid salary for October so I thot he will come with money but hey no luck
20/11/23, 2:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Innocent, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Innocent's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
20/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Yes
20/11/23, 3:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Innocent's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Innocent's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
20/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 247 1226: I will try my best
20/11/23, 3:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263782471226 Since you have answered all the questions, now a video call would be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Innocent's application.

22/11/23, 2:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Innocent's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways

*1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

*2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:-* Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

*3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
22/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 247 1226: Thank you for sharing and for your concern
22/11/23, 5:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So what have you understood ?

29/11/23, 11:21 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greetings

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
