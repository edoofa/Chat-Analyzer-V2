Can you please elaborate their challenges regarding the finances?
09/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 549 8434: The cost of tuition and airfare
09/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 549 8434: They might not get the full amount of funds needed
09/11/23, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand the same, 

May I know how are you planning your higher education in India from a financial aspect, Cheryl?
09/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Financial aid or earn while learn program
09/11/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, however are you clear that you require financial support from your parents?
09/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 549 8434: I'm seeking for a fully funded scholarship
09/11/23, 5:12 pm - +263 78 549 8434: But I'm sure they can help with something else that's cheaper
09/11/23, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
09/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes ,thank you maam I was actually mistaken but I've understood it clearly
09/11/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome.

I hope now you are aware that Edoofa is a scholarship program?
09/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes ma'am I am
09/11/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful,

So now may I know about your financial planning?
09/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Sorry maam but what  do you mean exactly?
09/11/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: May I know about financial planning and supporting!

Now that you know you require financial support for higher education in India, how are you planning the same please?
09/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 549 8434: My parents will
09/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Or help from relatives
09/11/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: That's good,

Now let me share a document with you to understand everything better.

You can read, and inform me once you have completed reading.
09/11/23, 6:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes I'm done ma'am
09/11/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
09/11/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
09/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Well I've understood that Edoofa is not a charitable organization ,it's a for-profit organization that helps deserving students with  life changing opportunities
09/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 549 8434: It helps with higher education and internship opportunities
09/11/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Cheryl 

And what all did you understand regarding the financial aspect?
09/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 549 8434: I've understood that Edoofa is not a fully funded scholarship and it helps reduce the amount of tuition needed 
For those who are not under the program they have to pay $6000 to $8000 and for those under  the program their fund is $2000 to3000$ off which it is way better and beneficial
09/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Quite appreciated
09/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 549 8434: And you can also earn scholarship credits but not in form cash and it can help your funds for the following semester
09/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Thank you
09/11/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!

I am glad you thoroughly read the document, Cheryl.
09/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes ma'am 
Thank you
09/11/23, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: So Cheryl, when would you be appearing your A level exams please?
09/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 549 8434: 2025
09/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 549 8434: But I was hoping to go for L5 there in India
09/11/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: You mean you wish to opt for a diploma right after O level, Cheryl?
09/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yess
09/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great.

So are your parents aware of the same too?
09/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes Ms Harmehak
09/11/23, 7:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, 

So I believe you understand the following now?
09/11/23, 7:24 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
09/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Quite understood,yes
09/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 549 8434: So many years will I take
09/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please!

Can you elaborate?
09/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 549 8434: How many years does it take for the diploma
09/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Is it two or?
09/11/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: Three years please.
09/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Okay thank you
09/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
09/11/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: So after going through the same,

Are your parents willing to support you financially, Cheryl?

15/11/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

I hope we are together so far please?
15/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 544 9553: Yes Maam
15/11/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

15/11/23, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

So what is your financial planning to support Cheryl please?
15/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 544 9553: I will save and badget
15/11/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Mrs Ottilia!

I would be continuing the discussion with Cheryl in that case.

Feel free to share any queries.
15/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 544 9553: Ok then..thank you
15/11/23, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
15/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes maam
15/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 549 8434: But I'm still an O level student
15/11/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: The same applies for O level students as well.
15/11/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
15/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 549 8434: How many O level subjects are required
15/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Okay right now I'm waiting for my results
15/11/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Typically, for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, a minimum of five passes in O-level subjects is required. However, specific requirements may vary course to course.
15/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Quite understood maam
15/11/23, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful!
15/11/23, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: May I know the subjects you were pursuing in your O level, Cheryl?
15/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 549 8434: 10

15/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 549 8434: And also I've always known that Indians have got a strong intellectual capacity and what more if they are teaching you, you will acknowledge more
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: That's interesting, Cheryl.

I can see you have awareness.
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Thank you let me read through it
15/11/23, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Cheryl.
15/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 549 8434: This is quite interesting ma'am
15/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 549 8434: At least my thoughts are quite true about India
15/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 549 8434: I'm glad to notice
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Cheryl 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 78 549 8434: This even boosted my dream of coming there
15/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 549 8434: But are you referring to students in India or other scholarships out of India
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Cheryl.
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: In India
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes
15/11/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: That's great
15/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 549 8434: It's $8000 am I right ?
15/11/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: Let me add, about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/11/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/11/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/11/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 549 8434: What if I'm opt for off campus
15/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Very interesting maam
15/11/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: Cheryl, let me help you have better clarity about the same please

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
15/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Okay very well ma'am
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Ohh nice
15/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 549 8434: For how long does the scholarship last
15/11/23, 8:26 pm - Harmehak: For your entire course duration please.

The fee remains constant and the scholarship is there throughout.
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Ohh yess thank you
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 549 8434: This is very interesting maam
15/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 549 8434: I'm glad you're making me understand clearly
15/11/23, 8:33 pm - Harmehak: That's great to know
15/11/23, 8:33 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Ma'am you're giving me hope
15/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Thank you
15/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Cheryl
15/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Cheryl, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 549 8434: 1500 to 2250
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Cheryl, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 549 8434: I do
15/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 549 8434: So are you saying you need 350 at the moment
15/11/23, 9:01 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their O-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final O level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
15/11/23, 9:01 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 549 8434: So maam are you saying I can start the program before coming there
15/11/23, 9:05 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, the Earn While You Learn Program is started way before you come to India.

Your mentor would get in touch once you enroll into the program.
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Ohh okay I did <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 549 8434: So ma'am are you saying if I start the program and earn 700 my parents will have to pay 1100 if my fees is 1800
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Just assuming
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - Harmehak: That's alright.
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - Harmehak: Like I briefed you right here.
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Thank you ma'am
15/11/23, 9:13 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
15/11/23, 9:13 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/11/23, 9:13 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

16/11/23, 12:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
16/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes sir
16/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 549 8434: How are you doing?
16/11/23, 2:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
16/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes Mr Sahil
16/11/23, 2:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
16/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 549 8434: I'm not done talking to Mrs Ruth yet
16/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know the reason for the delay ?
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 549 8434: My data expired yesterday night and I had to purchase today
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 549 8434: But I've sent her some messages
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 549 8434: I'm sorry sir
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Its okay you can connect today
16/11/23, 4:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
16/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 549 8434: I would also love that
16/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Thank you Mr Sahil
16/11/23, 5:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

7.Yes I am
16/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 549 8434: I've talked to Mrs Ruth
16/11/23, 6:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
16/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes they're
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 21st or 22nd November 2023 for $200 and the 21st or 22nd of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 21st or 22nd of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

20/11/23, 12:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Afternoon, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Hello sir
20/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 549 8434: How are you?
20/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Sorry I went for an exam so i wasn't online
20/11/23, 5:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you , Wishing you all the best for the exams.
20/11/23, 5:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through the acceptance letter ?
20/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes sir I did
20/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Thank you sir and I'm also done I'm left with 2 papers
20/11/23, 5:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payments modes in depth ?
20/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 78 549 8434: Yes I would love that
20/11/23, 5:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
20/11/23, 5:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
