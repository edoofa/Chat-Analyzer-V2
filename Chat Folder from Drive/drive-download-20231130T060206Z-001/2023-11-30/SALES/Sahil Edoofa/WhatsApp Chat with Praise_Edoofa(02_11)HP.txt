1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
07/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I can say Edoofa is an exceptional program with a vision to make affordable higher quality education available for all . When l was going through the document l understand that Edoofa is looking for bright, meritorious and deserving students who have a passion for education and a long term vision .It also assist students to have an insight on how to network with others and at the end result is for students to have good communication , social media literacy and also creative content writing .

I also understand that this Scholarship will help a student to reduce the cost and expenses of higher education in India , this is a 50%-100% scholarship on the tuition fee . With the help of Edoofa the fee will comes down from $6000-$8000/year to $2000-$3000/year 

I can say Edoofa Scholarship Program is one in a million because it helps  students through financially and physically.
07/11/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to see that you thoroughly followed and understood the document, Praise!

So far do you have any queries please?
07/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 086 8655: So far l just want to know how long does it take for a student to be part of Edoofa Scholarship Program
07/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I'm sorry for later reply Ms Harmehak

07/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I think during dinner time
07/11/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
07/11/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Now that you are aware of the finances required, do you think your parents willing to support you with $1500 a year for your higher education in India?
07/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I'm not quite sure if my parents are willing to support me with $1500 a year at my higher education in India .

I would like Edoofa Scholarship Program to give me a fully funded scholarship
07/11/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand the same Praise.

May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship?
07/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Scholarship in which an organization body sponsor a student completely, right from application to travel to education and expenses .
07/11/23, 6:03 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
07/11/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I'm glad that u have manage to make me understand ,thank you so much Ms Harmehak
07/11/23, 6:08 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome Praise.
07/11/23, 6:08 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa provides scholarship itself please.
07/11/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Alright now l know a lot of thanks to you Ms Harmehak
07/11/23, 6:11 pm - Harmehak: I am glad it could help.

So far do you have any queries?
07/11/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 086 8655: So far l do not have queries , l would like to thank you  because l have learnt a lot
07/11/23, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words.

I shall expect your response please.
07/11/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Tomorrow are we going to have a session on 11:30AM CAT Ms Harmehak or

08/11/23, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Praise

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
08/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Without any scholarships l can say there is no chance me and my familiar with the costs of similar quality higher education for an international student
08/11/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand Praise.
08/11/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/11/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/11/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Thats why l really want to be part of Edoofa Scholarship Program because it is affordable
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate Praise.
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Praise, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
08/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 086 8655: So if my  Alevel are not good would l be able to study in India or not
08/11/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate your query?

A level are not good- what are your referring to please?
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 086 8655: According to accommodation does a international student rent or stay at the University
08/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I'm saying what if my Alevel results comes not good do l still have a chance to go and study in India
08/11/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: Let me help you have better clarity about the same please

For us every student is like our family, Parents send their child for higher education on a belief that Edoofa Program will be there to take good care of their child during the course of their education itself, and because of that for us, student's safety and security is the utmost priority. Due to this itself, the student's accommodation is done on the University Campus itself, as the University campus is the most secure place any student can find, while their higher education itself.
08/11/23, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: Aren't you confident that you can score two Advanced level passes, Praise?
08/11/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected? <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I'm very confident that l will definitely pass l was just asking .
08/11/23, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: That's good,

However may I know the reason behind such delayed response?
08/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Now understand clearly Ms Harmehak thank you once again for making me understand
08/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Evening Ms Harmehak.
08/11/23, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: Please?
08/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I was out of battery LM sorry for that Ms Harmehak
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: Do you have enough of it to proceed now?
08/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I was out of battery please forgive me for that !
08/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I don't have enough as we are facing a problem of loadshedding
08/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: I understand please
08/11/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: So now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you and your family
08/11/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/11/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/11/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Thanks for understanding Ms Harmehak .
08/11/23, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed Praise?
08/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I have go through Ms Harmehak
08/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: That's great
08/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/11/23, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/11/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: No please!

Each student is alloted an individual mentor who assists them with their schedule as well.

You begin with your EWYL journey from Zimbabwe itself.
08/11/23, 8:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Ms Harmehak can we continue with our discussion tomorrow because  my battery is low ?
08/11/23, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: We are left with 10-15 minutes of discussion itself!

May I know if you would be able to complete?
08/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I'm not quite sure maybe l would be able to complete  or not
08/11/23, 8:26 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.
08/11/23, 8:26 pm - Harmehak: Let me schedule the discussion for tomorrow.
08/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I really appreciate your  understanding .
08/11/23, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
09/11/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Good afternoon Ms Harmehak,l hope you are doing well!
09/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Praise!
09/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Have you gone through our discussion from yesterday?
09/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Im glad to hear that .
09/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I'm not yet done
09/11/23, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Haven't you gone through the pictures I shared regarding EWYL please?
09/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I have gone through 

Some were not yet downloaded
09/11/23, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: I can understand
09/11/23, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: Praise, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
09/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Yes LM ready .
09/11/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Praise, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
09/11/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
09/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 086 8655: If a student were to apply to 5 universities with an application fee ranging between $300-$450,they would likely to spend up between $1,500-$2,250.
09/11/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
09/11/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
09/11/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Yes COVID 19 pandemic has slowed down everything around the world
09/11/23, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please
09/11/23, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
09/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 086 8655: So for a student to apply for the whole process she/ he , has to pay $750
09/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 086 8655: I think soo
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: No please, the fee is $350
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
09/11/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Alright now l understand
09/11/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
09/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Atleast it is affordable to pay bit by bit
09/11/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement, Praise.
09/11/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
09/11/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
09/11/23, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
09/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Yes l have refered to it
09/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Yes l have understood thank you for making me understand Ms Harmehak
09/11/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/11/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
09/11/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

09/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 086 8655: Now l really understand
09/11/23, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
09/11/23, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

09/11/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
09/11/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
