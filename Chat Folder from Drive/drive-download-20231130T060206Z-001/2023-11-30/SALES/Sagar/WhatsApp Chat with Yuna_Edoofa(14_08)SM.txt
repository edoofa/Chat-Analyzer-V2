29/08/23, 10:02 am - Sagar: So very importantly, 
I want to inform you that the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. *But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough resources and study materials due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting. Therefore, after the evaluations, the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
29/08/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 491 4535: I'm so confident about this ,I'm even hoping to achieve more than just 2 A level passes

31/08/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 491 4535: Yes ... But I would really appreciate it if you explain to me a little bit more
31/08/23, 9:59 am - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly.

Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course?

And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

Working as an accountant in one of the big firms wether In my country or abroad
31/08/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Yuna

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
31/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 491 4535: I'm Sorry for the late reply I was  at school
31/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 491 4535: Yes I'm very certain and I'm ready to give all of my hard work so that I can be able to make it
31/08/23, 2:40 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
31/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 491 4535: I'm pretty sure that over there I can get better education than here in my country, plus the fact that you guys are willing to help that makes me even like it more
31/08/23, 2:48 pm - Sagar: *I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?*
31/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 491 4535: No
31/08/23, 3:22 pm - Sagar: Alright, I understand that basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad, so if you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship which would help you have the kind of exposure you are aiming to have, Can you tell me about how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
31/08/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 491 4535: I'm also aiming to help some of the kids whom their parents can't afford to send them to school so that they can get the education they deserve because education is every kid's right. So I would like to offer as much help as I can
31/08/23, 3:41 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
31/08/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 491 4535: That's true
31/08/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
31/08/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 491 4535: I have a cousin brother who once studied there, so he's the one who've been telling that it's pretty good out there, be it the education facilities and also the environment is also conducive for learning
31/08/23, 3:51 pm - Sagar: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

31/08/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 491 4535: Indeed India is a blessed nation
31/08/23, 4:06 pm - Sagar: May I know if you understood everything properly?
31/08/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 491 4535: Yes I di
31/08/23, 4:08 pm - Sagar: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
31/08/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 491 4535: No we don't... I haven't done the research about it
31/08/23, 4:22 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
31/08/23, 4:22 pm - Sagar: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
31/08/23, 4:22 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 491 4535: So the universities agreed to enroll students at a cost of $2000 from$8000??
31/08/23, 4:32 pm - Sagar: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
31/08/23, 4:51 pm - Sagar: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

Kindly go through the link below :
 https://www.instagram.com/edoofa/

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
31/08/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 491 4535: Yes I would like to know what it is
01/09/23, 9:01 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

_"When you've seen beyond yourself, then you may find, peace of mind is waiting there."_

 Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 491 4535: Good morning
01/09/23, 10:33 am - Sagar: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/09/23, 10:34 am - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
01/09/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 491 4535: So the students will be only working online or
01/09/23, 10:43 am - Sagar: Yuna, they will be working online.
01/09/23, 10:43 am - Sagar: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
01/09/23, 10:43 am - Sagar: 1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics




3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
01/09/23, 10:44 am - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
01/09/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 491 4535: Oh ok
01/09/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 491 4535: Ok ok I totally understood
01/09/23, 11:30 am - Sagar: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
01/09/23, 11:30 am - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/09/23, 11:32 am - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
01/09/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 491 4535: I get it
01/09/23, 11:37 am - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
01/09/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 491 4535: Yes
01/09/23, 11:40 am - Sagar: Yuna as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/09/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 491 4535: Applying for 5 universities a student would pay an amount of $1500_$2250
01/09/23, 11:51 am - Sagar: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/09/23, 11:52 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 491 4535: Oh ok... That's a little bit cheaper
01/09/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 491 4535: So January 31 is the final deadline for 2024 intake
01/09/23, 11:57 am - Sagar: Yes, Yuna.
01/09/23, 11:57 am - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
01/09/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 491 4535: That's a very good thing
01/09/23, 12:38 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/09/23, 12:39 pm - Sagar: Yuna basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
01/09/23, 12:39 pm - Sagar: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/09/23, 1:19 pm - Sagar: @263784914535 are we connected?
01/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 491 4535: Oh yes
01/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 491 4535: I get it
01/09/23, 1:56 pm - Sagar: I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
01/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 491 4535: Yes I've understood very well
01/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sagar: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
01/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sagar: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
01/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 491 4535: I think I did
01/09/23, 2:51 pm - Sagar: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.

01/09/23, 2:51 pm - Sagar: This message was deleted
01/09/23, 2:52 pm - Sagar: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$750) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).
01/09/23, 2:52 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
01/09/23, 2:52 pm - Sagar: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

01/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 491 4535: Oh I see
01/09/23, 2:58 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
01/09/23, 2:58 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
01/09/23, 2:58 pm - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
