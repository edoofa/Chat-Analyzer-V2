You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 837 4564: Thank you so much Mr Gurvinder for having here on this platform
29/11/23, 10:54 am - Sagar: It is my pleasure.
29/11/23, 10:55 am - Sagar: Alright, so Fadzai, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Master, is that correct?
29/11/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 837 4564: Yes that's right
29/11/23, 12:05 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Master, also do tell me whether you learnt about Master’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 837 4564: I learnt that your organisation is offering scholarships and also that I can work while studying
29/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: I see you are well informed.
29/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Let me also brief you about the program.
29/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Master talked to me about the 5pointer that you offer and that i should do them with outmost sincerity
29/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sagar: That is correct.
29/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sagar: Please address this.
29/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Yes that's true
29/11/23, 12:21 pm - Sagar: Okay so Fadzai, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Yes . I think I can do it.
29/11/23, 1:05 pm - Sagar: Alright so Fadzai, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
29/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 837 4564: I am  Fadzai Mudzamba. Recently turned 18 and currently in lower 6. Did my form 1-4 at Howard High School in Mashonaland Central. At the end of form 4 , had 5As and 5Bs . Right now i am studying commercials at Zengeza High School and I would like to pursue accounting. I am a part of Environmental Club ten and also a part of the Zengeza Youth Sanctuary club . When i am not studying, i usually spend my time reading novels and helping out in the society. My parents are self employed and they are into farming
29/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 837 4564: I have better leadership skills . I have also been groomed and received leadership training from ICMF ...

29/11/23, 1:30 pm - Sagar: So Fadzai, could you kindly tell me how much *Zengeza High School* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
29/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Each term is charged 75usd and 100rgts . My father who is into farming is the one who pays for my school fees

29/11/23, 1:32 pm - Sagar: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study accounting, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
29/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Zimbabwe is not economically stable and has adopted the dollarization system to help due to an unstable currency. So i have had an interest in accounting with the hope that one day i will be successful in that field and will be able to help in giving back to the society and also improving the economic systems such that the living conditions in this country are improved
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: Noted, that is a noble cause.
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sagar: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?

29/11/23, 3:23 pm - Sagar: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
29/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Okay
29/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Noted
29/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
29/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sagar: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
29/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Yes i have an aim to achieve higher
29/11/23, 3:55 pm - Sagar: So should I brief you about the course now?
29/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 71 837 4564: Yes please.
