*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for your son from his friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same! <This message was edited>
