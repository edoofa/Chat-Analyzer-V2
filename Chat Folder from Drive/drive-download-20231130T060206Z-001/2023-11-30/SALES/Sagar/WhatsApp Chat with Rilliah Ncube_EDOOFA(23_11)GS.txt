23/11/23, 1:39 pm - Sagar: Good Morning Rillia, Mr. and Mrs. Ncube!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
23/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Good afternoon
23/11/23, 1:56 pm - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Rilliah,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 196 9072: Good afternoon
23/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Oky noted
23/11/23, 2:49 pm - Sagar: Good Afternoon Mr.Ncube .
23/11/23, 2:50 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Rilliah, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Angel, is that correct?
23/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Yes sir
23/11/23, 2:53 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Angel, also do tell me whether you learnt about Angel’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
23/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Oky so what I learnt was that the Edoofa Program is a program which costs less than most of the University's in Zimbabwe and not only that but you can earn while you learn too. One should take not to learn about the 5' S in order to qualify for the scholarship which include:
1.sensibility
2.self-analysis
3.self-questioning
4.self-absorption
5.scrutiny

In Angel's side of the story she underwent an investigation by asking her seniors that were already at University's and some done and noted that one should compromise his course due to limited seats and also it was noted that the number of graduates unemployed is very high. She wanted to support her family interms of finance that's when she came about the Earn While you learn Program offered at Edoofa which gives opportunities for one to earn through the course
That's all I learnt
23/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sagar: Great answer Rilliah, I see you are well informed.
23/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sagar: But let me also brief you about the program.
23/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Yes indeed
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Sagar: Okay so Rilliah, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Yes I do
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Sagar: Alright so Rilliah, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Arts in Geography*
29/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 231 3286: Oky it sounds interesting can you please add more in this study
29/11/23, 9:57 am - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
29/11/23, 9:57 am - Sagar: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
29/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 231 3286: Oky
