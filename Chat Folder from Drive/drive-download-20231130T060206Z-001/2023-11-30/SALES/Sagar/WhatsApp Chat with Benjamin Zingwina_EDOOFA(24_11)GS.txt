24/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Oky and it is also a great pleasure to connect with you Mr Gurvinder , Mr. Shubham and Mr Jyotishman
24/11/23, 2:54 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Benjamin, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Takunda, is that correct?
24/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Yes Sir, Takunda introduced this program to me
24/11/23, 3:00 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Takunda, also do tell me whether you learnt about Takunda’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
24/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Okay sir ,from the knowledge that I obtained from Takunda about the Edoofa program I have seen that the Edoofa program is an innovative program that is designed to help students on how to overcome the financial and academic barriers that often prevent them from achieving their dreams. It also helps to pursue their passion and realizing their full potential. This program is also unique in the sense that it combines academic excellence with practical skill training and mentorship.
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - Sagar: Well said Benjamin.
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - Sagar: But let me also brief you about the program.
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/11/23, 3:09 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 3:09 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
24/11/23, 3:09 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Yes I learnt about takunda's journey and it was incredibly good as he is hardworking guy who is able to go far with his education while giving his 100% effort and he exonerated how he attain the scholarship with Edoofa , he went through the counseling session, eligibility test and interview, acceptance into the program
24/11/23, 3:13 pm - Sagar: Noted, now let me brief you about the program.
24/11/23, 3:13 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation.

24/11/23, 3:18 pm - Sagar: Yes that is correct Benjamin, and I hope you will be one of them too.
24/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Yes Mr Gurvinder we hope so
24/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sagar: Okay so Benjamin, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
24/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
24/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Yes but may You please 🙏 add my sister and my older brother who are always online who will always participate in the counseling session

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
27/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Yes Sir, I am willing to give 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come my way inorder to transform my career
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 797 7900: One of the biggest advantages of studying abroad is the chance to experience another culture that's entirely different from your own. This enriching experience will help me see things in a different perspective. I will get to try new food, visit new places, listen to traditional music and lots more. It is easier to communicate with like-minded people owing to the shared nativity and connections. Studying abroad helps to broaden your network and connections, both professional and personal. Being in a new place paves the way for newer perspectives and renewed energy for an enriching experience abroad.

 I am motivated to study abroad because this is simply be for the pleasure that comes from encountering new experiences and perspectives.
27/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Studying abroad would implement a positive impact on my career because the learning facilities offered abroad are better than in our country and I can aim to achieve my career aspirations from studying abroad by giving my 100% effort and hard work to stay positive and surround myself with positive people, In that way I find myself motivated to carry out the activities that will help me succeed in my courses
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
27/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 797 7900: With studying abroad, you can experience new places and cultures, make friends from around the world, and gain a global perspective-while earning credits towards your degree. It will allow me to develop highly-valued skills such as intercultural communication, foreign languages, adaptability, and problem-solving.
27/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 797 7900: I am planning to contribute my learnings from abroad towards the development of the education in my country by encouraging future generations on which fields to opt for and which recipes to take in life as I'll have attained the qualifications I am looking forward to through Edoofa. Following NY success when I be strong financially I am planning to give a hand in raising infrastructure for learning within my community and purchase learning equipments for upcoming youngsters
27/11/23, 3:13 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Benjamin, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 797 7900: I agree Sir
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
27/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Yes that's true Sir , am wandering why?
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sagar: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

29/11/23, 8:32 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
29/11/23, 1:03 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?
29/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Hello God Afternoon Sir
29/11/23, 1:51 pm - Sagar: Let us continue the session.
29/11/23, 1:52 pm - Sagar: So now Benjamin, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
29/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Yes sure Sir
29/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Yes I have understood sir
29/11/23, 1:53 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
29/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 797 7900: No Sir we aren't aware
29/11/23, 2:05 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/11/23, 2:05 pm - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/11/23, 2:05 pm - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/11/23, 2:05 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 2:05 pm - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/11/23, 2:06 pm - Sagar: In simple words Benjamin, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 797 7900: I understand 😊 Sir
29/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
29/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 797 7900: You can go ahead Sir
29/11/23, 2:22 pm - Sagar: Benjamin, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 797 7900: Okay thank you Sir for the information
29/11/23, 3:02 pm - Sagar: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

29/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
29/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
29/11/23, 4:52 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
