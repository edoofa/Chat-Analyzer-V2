2) *What are your understandings of the program as per your discussions with Tinotenda?*
24/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 077 4346: After tinotenda told me of the program l got into research and l understood that the program helps young people to archieve their dreams through scholarships and this gave me the zeal to join the program
24/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 077 4346: After l leant about the career l wish to persue and l knew my parents could not affort my area of interest so l took the opportunity to this program
24/11/23, 12:46 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
24/11/23, 12:46 pm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
24/11/23, 12:46 pm - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

24/11/23, 12:46 pm - Arshita: *I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity, aren't you?*
24/11/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Yes l am
24/11/23, 12:53 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
24/11/23, 12:54 pm - Arshita: So now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. Please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

*1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination*
*2. The course you would like to study and why?*

24/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Currently l finished my advanced level examinations and l am waiting for the results my combination was mathematics physics and   geography with passion and hope of persuing a career in aircraft engineering. I have 10 ordinary level passes
With 6Bs, 1A and 3cs.As for my parents my father is a police officer the highest level of education he got was ordinary level and my mother a small scale vendor. I have two siblings one intends to go for form1 next year and the other a 3 year old. My father has been supporting me financially and he also is going to be financing my higher education abroad at my previous  school the fees was $420-520 not quit sure but around that range which is loreto high school midlands province
24/11/23, 1:14 pm - Arshita: Good to know more about you. You expressed yourself genuinely. 

Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of aircraft engineering?
24/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 077 4346: My hobby is playing soccer my strength lies in    my endurance focus and knowing what l wish to do in my life and my weaknesses, the obvious one is that l find it difficult to quit or let go of a particular project or problem without solving it l cant do public speaking and lastly lm very social l say yes to everyone and end up with a lot of work
24/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 077 4346: No l dont

24/11/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
24/11/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
24/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 077 4346: I am
24/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 077 4346: So how many points now since it changed
24/11/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: Atleast 2
24/11/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 077 4346: I did do research but l did not apply to any of the universities
24/11/23, 1:58 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
24/11/23, 1:58 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 1:58 pm - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
24/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Done
24/11/23, 2:17 pm - Arshita: Looking at your interests and passion for aerosplanes and aeronautical, let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but since you do not have Chemistry you are not eligible for the same.

At the same time if you opt for a degree like *B.Tech. Computer Science Engineering*, it can help to bridge you to more opportunities at the same time helps to fulfill your interests to solve challenges, to bring innovations, and at the same time offer a wider spectrum of career opportunities 

So, shall I explain *B.Tech. Computer Science Engineering* in depth? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 077 4346: I do have chemistry l did not  do it A level only and is it critical that l have to do chemistry
24/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 077 4346: I dont have computer science at all not even ordinary level
24/11/23, 2:33 pm - Arshita: I don't see chemistry in your A level
24/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Ohhh l have to do it a level
24/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 077 4346: If cannot do aircraft engineering without A level Chemistry then how  do l do computer science engineering without computer science just a question
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - Arshita: Every specialisation has a different requirement. For fields like aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, etc chemistry, physics and Mathematics is mandatory in A level. 

For computer science engineering only physics and mathematics is mandatory.
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - Arshita: If you have alternate career aspirations besides engineering, you can let me know.
24/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 077 4346: My wish is to persue aircraft engineering
24/11/23, 2:46 pm - Arshita: But with your subjects you won't be able to do it
24/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Not to mean any  disrespect but could you please research if l can persue my desired program
24/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 077 4346: I would greatly appreciate as l indicated before my weakness is that lm into aeroplanes and l cant get over it
24/11/23, 7:49 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *12:00 pm CAT on Monday(27/11/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.
24/11/23, 7:49 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Hello
27/11/23, 12:35 pm - Arshita: Greetings!

 *A problem is a chance for you to do your best*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
27/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Yes
27/11/23, 12:36 pm - Arshita: Greetings! 

How are you doing?
27/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Today lm very well and ready to carry on
27/11/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: Good to know that!
27/11/23, 12:49 pm - Arshita: I can understand that but it is not possible!
27/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 077 4346: I did talk to parul university and they said its possible
27/11/23, 12:59 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 12:59 pm - Arshita: Lenos you can see that these are the requirements for the engineering . These are set by the All India Council for Technical Education which is the regulatory body in India . 

If any university is offering course against these guidelines it means that they are not UGC ( University Grants Commission ) accredited .

Even if you do a degree from such university your degree will not be valid  and thus you will not be able to find a job.
27/11/23, 1:00 pm - Arshita: First of all, the degree shared by Parul Universities are not recognized on a global level, if after spending $3000 for education abroad, degrees are not considered in other countries, would that be a worthwhile investment?
27/11/23, 1:00 pm - Arshita: *The most important reason is that the University isn't ranked under the  NIRF ranking under the Ministry of Education of the Government of India!*
27/11/23, 1:00 pm - Arshita: https://www.nirfindia.org/2021/Ranking.html

This is the Official Website of ranking of Colleges and Universities by Ministry of Education under Government of India and you will be surprised to see that Parul University *is not even a part of this ranking*
27/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 077 4346: So walk me into computer science engineering
27/11/23, 1:41 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
27/11/23, 1:41 pm - Arshita: B.Tech. Computer Science

So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
27/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 077 4346: That l have not looked at
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

27/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Thats a lot of good records l never knew those now curiosity and eagerness is killing me l wish l were therw
27/11/23, 2:57 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Learning from a country that rich in economy and having great education l will graduate and take persue my career anywhere because l would have learnt from the best with the economy increasing at that rate l wish l work in india
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
27/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Very costly in Dubai the cost is very high for education ranging from tens of thousands and with india's affordable and credible education and cost l think it is the best
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
27/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Im not quite sure but I will confirm with my father
27/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 077 4346: But its better than the other
27/11/23, 7:14 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
27/11/23, 7:34 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *11:30 pm CAT on Tuesday(28/11/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

29/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Is it not the earn while you learn program
29/11/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: Yes
29/11/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
29/11/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
29/11/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/11/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/11/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
29/11/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

29/11/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Yes l can
29/11/23, 4:14 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
29/11/23, 4:14 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Yes l understand the more you work the less the money for the family
29/11/23, 4:41 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
29/11/23, 4:41 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
29/11/23, 4:41 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
29/11/23, 4:41 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
29/11/23, 4:41 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
29/11/23, 4:41 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
29/11/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 077 4346: All but mostly1and²
29/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 077 4346: 2
29/11/23, 4:50 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

29/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 077 4346: I can see
29/11/23, 4:57 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 78 077 4346: The family
29/11/23, 5:09 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 78 077 4346: My family wishes that l study abroad and they are happy lm connecting with you and about discussing they told me to handle everything because as we are talking my father is in remote rural areas at work
29/11/23, 5:15 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
29/11/23, 5:15 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
29/11/23, 5:15 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
29/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Yes it is
29/11/23, 6:10 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
29/11/23, 6:10 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
29/11/23, 6:11 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 6:11 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
29/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Yes
29/11/23, 6:49 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
29/11/23, 6:49 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 077 4346: Oky understood
29/11/23, 7:11 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
29/11/23, 7:26 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *12:0 pm CAT on Thursday(30/11/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.
