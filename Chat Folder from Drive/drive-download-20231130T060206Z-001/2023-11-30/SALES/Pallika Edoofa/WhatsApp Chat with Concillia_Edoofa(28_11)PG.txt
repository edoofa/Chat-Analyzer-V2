28/11/23, 3:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
28/11/23, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

28/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 808 4855: That's good news

28/11/23, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Yes l'm happy hear that you know the challenges
28/11/23, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Concillia, Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

28/11/23, 5:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

28/11/23, 5:16 pm - +263 78 808 4855: It's too much
28/11/23, 5:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that!!

 let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
28/11/23, 5:19 pm - +263 78 808 4855: No please explain that for me
28/11/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Concillia, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/11/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

28/11/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
28/11/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

28/11/23, 5:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
28/11/23, 5:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
28/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Yes
28/11/23, 5:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
28/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Oky I get the sense now
28/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Thank you
28/11/23, 5:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Concillia, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
28/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 808 4855: 4.
28/11/23, 5:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

28/11/23, 5:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
28/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Alright
28/11/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 808 4855: My family here
28/11/23, 5:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
28/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 808 4855: They are very happy to hear that my dream is about to come true
28/11/23, 5:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Concillia, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
28/11/23, 5:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
28/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Yes and a visa too
28/11/23, 5:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Exactly, Concillia.
28/11/23, 5:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
28/11/23, 5:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
28/11/23, 5:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 5:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
28/11/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Yes explain please
28/11/23, 6:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
28/11/23, 6:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Ooky
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 78 808 4855: 1
28/11/23, 6:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
28/11/23, 6:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
28/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 808 4855: No don't worry it's clear
28/11/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me explain other two steps too
28/11/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
28/11/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
28/11/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
28/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Oky thank you
28/11/23, 6:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Are you clear?
28/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Yes thank you so much
28/11/23, 6:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

29/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 808 4855: Yes we are good
29/11/23, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
29/11/23, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
29/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 808 4855: Yes but they are busy now
29/11/23, 11:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
29/11/23, 11:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: So may I know what discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
29/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 808 4855: They said l can't continue  doing this
29/11/23, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Concillia, May I know, what happened, please?
29/11/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 808 4855: They are not sure if this thing is legit

29/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Yes l see it seems legit
29/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 808 4855: I will join next year because another thing is that it requires me to pay $200 in 7days and my family won't be able to do that
29/11/23, 12:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I get it Concilia, do you know, why the intake of next year is already open for Zimbabwean students?
29/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 808 4855: No
29/11/23, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Concillia, Please note that the intake for 2024 is already open and form 6 students are reserving their seats for the same if qualified for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. The major reason for opening the Seat Reservation opportunity for Zimbabwean students is that they receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations were declared on *the 7th of August this year*, Malawians received their MSCE results in September, Zambians received the results this year itself when compared to Zimsec A level results(January-February 2024), and they are declared much earlier and the students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities, etc to evaluate the form 6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity. So we already have 750+ Zimbabwean students who have qualified for the next intake.
29/11/23, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Moreover, Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
29/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 808 4855: It's oky l was happy to hear about this program but it will take my family five years to get the amount of money needed in 7days
29/11/23, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Concilia, let us be honest here. We are well aware of the living conditions and expenses in Zimbabwe.
29/11/23, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
29/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Yes thank you so much Sir l appreciate your help and care  l think l should try to apply somewhere else where my family will afford
29/11/23, 12:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand Concillia, but with the explained living conditions in Zimbabwe where you spend so much for your living, food and basic necessities ,how would it take 5 years for you to raise the $200?
29/11/23, 12:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, if not Edoofa program, how will you be proceeding with your higher education?
29/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 808 4855: Remember l stay with a single parent and l have siblings too so l didn't thought there is an amount of money like that  required
29/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 808 4855: I will apply for Presidential scholarship Sir
29/11/23, 1:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I do remember Concillia, and I had shared the document for you to go through the details of the program and understand the process thoroughly along with the financial aspects after which you have confirmed the cost of education is comfortable to your family. May I know, what happened now, please?
