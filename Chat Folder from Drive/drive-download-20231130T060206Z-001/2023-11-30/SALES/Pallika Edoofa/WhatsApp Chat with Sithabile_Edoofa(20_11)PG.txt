21/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 723 2690: So you're saying l should budget $3000
21/11/23, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sithabile, To be precise, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from approx. $6000-$8000 per year, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost that is  approx. $2000-$3000. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity?"
21/11/23, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes. Sithabile, It approximately ranges to that much per year. <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 2:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Will you and your family be able to manage that?
21/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 723 2690: Yes, if is for next year will manage
21/11/23, 4:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sithabile! Since you are currently in O Level, I'm excited to inform you that we have open admissions for the 2024 and 2025 intakes, specifically designed for students in Form 5 and Form 6. The entire application process will extend into the next year. Now, could you kindly indicate your preference? Are you inclined towards pursuing a diploma course here in India or an A Level program?
21/11/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 723 2690: A diploma
21/11/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 723 2690: In india
21/11/23, 6:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Sithabile, I understand that!!
