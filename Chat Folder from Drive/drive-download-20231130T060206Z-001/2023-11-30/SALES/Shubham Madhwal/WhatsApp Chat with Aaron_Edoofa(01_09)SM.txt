28/09/23, 10:10 am - +27 61 139 7091: An animator produces multiple images called frames, which when sequenced together create an illusion of movement - this is known as animation. The images can be made up of digital or hand-drawn pictures, models or puppets. Animators tend to work in 2D, 3D model-making, stop-frame or computer-generated animation.

*Here's some stuff you might want to know*

*Question*: How would you describe a good animator?
*Answer*: a creative mind and a strong visual imagination.

an eye for detail and good colour vision. the ability to draw, make models and/or use computer graphics software. patience and stamina - the work is painstakingly detailed and you may need to work long hours to meet deadlines.

*Question*: What is the job description of a 2D animator?
*Answer*: What does a 2D animator do? Following a script and/or storyboard, 2D animators draw frame-by-frame sequential images that simulate the actions of a character, prop, or machine in a two-dimensional space. 2D animations can vary in length from a 5-second brand logo to a feature film, TV series, or 2D video game.

*Question*: How do you describe animation?
*Answer*: Animation is a method of photographing successive drawings, models, or even puppets, to create an illusion of movement in a sequence. Because our eyes can only retain an image for approximately 1/10 of a second, when multiple images appear in fast succession, the brain blends them into a single moving image.
28/09/23, 10:14 am - Sagar: Aaron, may I know what is that, please?
28/09/23, 10:20 am - +27 61 139 7091: Since you gave me a description of BCA and we were previously chatting about any other course l would like to pursue except for Engineering, l think you were giving me an example of how l must describe the other course so that you fully understand

04/10/23, 3:36 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Thanks sir , l will go through it now ,l am from school

04/10/23, 3:52 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Indian is indeed amazing, l really need to witness all of these things
04/10/23, 3:59 pm - Sagar: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
04/10/23, 4:02 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Not really, l think my brother knows a bit, l think l know but not fully confident
04/10/23, 4:07 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
04/10/23, 4:07 pm - Sagar: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/10/23, 4:07 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 4:14 pm - +27 61 139 7091: This is far cheaper than other countries, l have been trying to find what the scholarship covers, l haven't found it but seems like the scholarship is  more about covering the fees right?
04/10/23, 4:28 pm - Sagar: Well Please I would like you to be informed that the University evaluates the scholarship amount basis on the following points.

1. Academic 
2. Merit
3. Extra-Curricular Activities. 
4. Statement of purpose.
5. Recommendation from Edoofa.
04/10/23, 4:29 pm - Sagar: To further Add on the Point 5th Mentioned above
 *Recommendation from Edoofa*


As you are aware that this counselling session itself will be used as one of the evaluation criteria to check whether you are suitable a candidate for the scholarship or not, Along with that you will also be appearing for our in-house Scholarship Test and Interview with the Edoofa Scholarship Board.

After this, we give also give you the opportunity to further reduce your remaining fees as much as you can through our *Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/10/23, 4:38 pm - Sagar: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

06/10/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
06/10/23, 2:23 pm - Sagar: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 3:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule. 

Meanwhile you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

10/10/23, 8:40 am - +27 61 139 7091: Morning sir
10/10/23, 9:06 am - Sagar: Good morning, everyone!

10/10/23, 9:25 am - +27 61 139 7091: I am a bit busy these days and I will even be more busy as l move towards the finals starting 30th of October ,but l will try to make time as much as possible
10/10/23, 9:32 am - Sagar: Alright, Aaron
10/10/23, 9:32 am - Sagar: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
10/10/23, 10:19 am - +27 61 139 7091: I think the programs is more than pursuing a goal but opens up many closed doors in your life. From my perspective , Edoofa is a way forward for me , l believe  l am in the waiting stage of receiving the greatest experience l ever heard. I looked at your Webinars , the most important part is despite of the program's ability to make you successful , it makes you happy and that l always values because then you comfortable .l am just worried about how sometimes good things like this are hard to achieve .
10/10/23, 10:41 am - Sagar: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/10/23, 10:41 am - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

10/10/23, 10:42 am - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
10/10/23, 1:43 pm - Sagar: @27611397091 are we connected?
10/10/23, 1:53 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Yes we are
10/10/23, 1:55 pm - +27 61 139 7091: This looks good plus its a new experience . l just hope l will find  program that goes together with the degree
10/10/23, 2:12 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
10/10/23, 2:32 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Can we please start at 3pm
10/10/23, 2:39 pm - Sagar: Aaron, my working hours will almost be over by then.
10/10/23, 2:40 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Ok lets get it done
10/10/23, 2:40 pm - Sagar: Aaron, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
10/10/23, 2:45 pm - +27 61 139 7091: $1500-$2250
10/10/23, 2:45 pm - Sagar: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
10/10/23, 2:46 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:48 pm - +27 61 139 7091: That's great more affordable
10/10/23, 2:52 pm - +27 61 139 7091: So the payment must be done on this day
10/10/23, 3:15 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
10/10/23, 3:28 pm - +27 61 139 7091: I think that is good , minimize the load
10/10/23, 3:52 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
10/10/23, 3:58 pm - Sagar: Aaron basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their Grade 12 result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final Grade 12 results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.* <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 3:59 pm - Sagar: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
10/10/23, 5:01 pm - Sagar: @27611397091 are we connected?
10/10/23, 9:25 pm - Sagar: @27611397091 I am still waiting for your response.
10/10/23, 9:26 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Sir, so is it a step l have to take now , so that I can notify my parents
10/10/23, 9:35 pm - Sagar: No, you will have to pay after receiving the acceptance letter
10/10/23, 9:35 pm - Sagar: I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
10/10/23, 9:38 pm - +27 61 139 7091: I understand , l will read again ,if l have questions l will ask you
10/10/23, 9:39 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 9:39 pm - Sagar: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in South Africa itself.
10/10/23, 9:39 pm - Sagar: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
10/10/23, 9:43 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Yes thank you , that was helpful
10/10/23, 9:43 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Yes l understand, this is helpful
10/10/23, 9:44 pm - Sagar: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
10/10/23, 9:44 pm - Sagar: So let me tell you that the next step After you are done interacting with the university you will receive your offer letter( UNIVERSITY ACCEPTANCE LETTER) from the university where your fee and scholarship will be mentioned and the university will give you a few week's time to make the payment of registration fee. Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025).
10/10/23, 9:44 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
10/10/23, 9:44 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 9:46 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
10/10/23, 9:46 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
10/10/23, 9:46 pm - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Despite of Rwanda's genocide , Rwanda has propelled forward at an amazing pace . 

In accordance with the tragic deaths and events which models the strong significant memorable history ,many  people still associate Rwanda with genocide even thou it's been decades.

The was an apparent positive growth due to the creation of the ICFR in1994, which paved the way for international justice .Since civil war and genocide left the country in ruins , Rwanda has undergone a remarkable transformation . Growth rates since 1995 have arranged 8 percent annually , poverty rates have fallen , maternal and child healthy have improved and infrastructure and public institutions have been rebuilt.
13/10/23, 11:49 pm - +27 61 139 7091: The country's development has come further in the past 16years than even the most optimistic observe would have predicted. These improvements is important to recognize because it has been the government's express policy to deliver basic services and economic growth to its people to order  to dispose genocide ideology.

Currently there has been some terrorism and ongoing complaints about democratic principles , but incomparison with the situation five years ago is different. Traveling anywhere in the county was restricted but now every  place is no longer having Barriers.
Rwanda is rated as one of the peaceful countries in Africa at the moment as well as less corrupt .

This is significant enough to prove  that Rwanda have the ability to become more and more stable their economy .
Rwanda's achievements foreshadows that the progress will continue since they  joined organizations like,AU which help them  achieve democracy .





Section 6

Personality Test 
"My lnspirational Story " " Crisis does not creat character .It reveals it.

Its mostly likely to determine someone's character during crisis .The majority of the people turns to think it originates during the crises , what is your
 opinion? 

Character is mended by an action but is processed in the left hemisphere of your brain. A powerful mind formats success . The ability to distinguish between what is right and wrong is the most significant aspect in one's life.One' attitude, behavior and values determine the path they are likely to tread . 

The conducts that builds character can be incorporated from role models but most of the time they are valued and finalized by  individuals , whether to decide to be vigilant or the act of pretence or confirming to every' style. 

A good example is poor decisions made by teens . In most cases here in Africa ill treatment receive by teenagers , by facing tough situation at home force them to deverge in a similar way. Factors like poverty, lack of necessities is always the main factor holding African teenagers down . However some just still bulldoze through the tough situations and get away . Its a simple matter of having a stable welly established characters, which is  designed to prepare and reduce the vulnerabilities. 

The world wonder why we have a lot of hoodwinkers . l found it disgusting when l was acknowledged it is because of how tight their situations are .The feeling of sympathy needs to be established in each and everyone's heart. The only difference mechanism towards those acts is sympathy .

Doctor Matin Luther fought for Black Americans freedom .Today l might just ask someone who is political knowledgised to form a political opposition party but they will refuse . The reason is their families and they are not ready to die . 

The question the world seem to laking is, what drive a man to face his death while he can still avoid it?It is the matter of character, which is a prominent factor build long before success and when crisis occur it's revealed.

02/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @27817502657 While, I was working on your application and advocating for a higher scholarship amount, I noticed something important. It appears that there is another eligible course that would align far better with your goals and offer a more efficient path to achieving them. 

Shall I brief you about the course and how it would align better with your career opportunities please?
02/11/23, 4:55 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Yes sir you can proceed
02/11/23, 4:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I am talking about the course of Bachelors in Computer Application.
02/11/23, 4:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I can tell you that a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications (BCA) opens up a variety of career opportunities in the field of Business Informatics. Business Informatics is the application of information technology to support business processes and decision-making. This field combines the knowledge of computer science and business management to provide solutions that increase efficiency and productivity in organizations.

Here are some of the career opportunities in the field of Business Informatics for those with a BCA degree:

Business Analyst: A Business Analyst is responsible for analyzing business processes and identifying areas for improvement. They use their knowledge of computer systems and software to develop solutions that support business goals.

Systems Analyst: Systems Analysts work with organizations to understand their business requirements and develop information systems to meet those needs. They also analyze existing systems and recommend changes to improve efficiency and productivity.

Data Analyst: Data Analysts use statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to identify trends and patterns in data. They work with organizations to make informed business decisions based on data insights.

Business Intelligence Developer: Business Intelligence Developers design and develop data warehousing and reporting systems. They work with organizations to analyze business data and create reports that support decision-making.

In conclusion, a BCA degree provides a strong foundation for a career in Business Informatics. These careers offer opportunities for growth and advancement and provide a chance to make a real impact on organizations by using technology to solve business problems.
03/11/23, 12:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Good Afternoon @27817502657
03/11/23, 12:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I was expecting to hear from you, may I know what happened?
03/11/23, 12:33 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Good day Mr Shubham. I apologies for the late response, i had a busy schedule yesterday. I have read and understood the career options available after studying computer Applications. I would like to know how does it translate to a higher scolarship amount
03/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Looking at your performance so far during the evaluation, the academic board can provide you with an ensured higher quantum scholarship since a Bachelor of Computer Application is practical oriented coruse whereas For B.Sc Computer Science it is a theoretical course,  and there would be more challenges to get a higher quantum, 

While considering the career propositions after completion of the course, both Bachelor of Computer Application and B.Sc Computer Science have equally rewarding opportunities, So according to me I would suggest you opt for Bachelor of Computer Application
03/11/23, 4:35 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Thank you for the heads up i think i will have to discuss with Aaron as well as the Parents,
