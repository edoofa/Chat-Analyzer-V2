03/10/23, 12:00 pm - Sagar: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
03/10/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 717 7093: Okay very sorry for the late reply was looking for a secure parking lot to attend to the meeting,Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100 % scholarship ,50
which is guaranteed on enrolment  and 100 which is dependend on his Grades and it is based in India
03/10/23, 12:46 pm - Sagar: *So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program*

Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
03/10/23, 12:46 pm - Sagar: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
03/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 717 7093: okay Noted

We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

10/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 717 7093: Thank you so much for the awareness
11/10/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 229 7277: Good morning sir,,,,.     We sincerely apologize for not  responding yesterday as you expected. We have energy crisis this side leading to load shedding hence our network is poor. This bleeds my heart because it's jeopardizing the future and career of son with Edoofa. However I would like to thank you for your patience and for rescheduling our session.                     On Kudakwashe 's results , l also want to highlight that he directly joined the exam class ( form4) after being asked to skip level 3 (form3) by his teachers.This was also during the COVID-19 pandemic. So he prepared for the examinations on his own. This shows how dedicated , hard working and committed he is
11/10/23, 9:13 am - Sagar: Good morning @263772297277 ,

Thank you for your message, and I completely understand the challenges you're facing with energy shortages and network issues. It's a difficult situation that can impact many aspects of daily life, including educational opportunities.
11/10/23, 9:14 am - Sagar: I appreciate your communication and your dedication to ensuring the best for Kudakwashe. His commitment and hard work are truly commendable, especially when studying independently during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. It speaks volumes about his determination and motivation.
11/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 717 7093: Thank you for the appreciation of his efforts
11/10/23, 9:25 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"You’re braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think"*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/10/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 229 7277: I find the document so informative..  ln summary it is an awareness intiative by Edoofa on how to identify scams. On verifying organizations the documents highlights that the student shoy check for the registration number , income tax and year of establishment of the organization for these are mandatory for every organization working with universities. The document also advise the student check originality of the documents and banking details. The organization must have office address as well. It is depicted in the document that some agents might be focused on earning  commissions rather than on career guidance  mentorship hence the need to look whether they have futuristic goals.
11/10/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 229 7277: My question is ,,,,, in the event that our son gets a scholarship with you is there any need to engage with other agencies
11/10/23, 9:49 am - Sagar: I'm glad to hear that you found the document informative. If your son secures a scholarship through Edoofa, you typically wouldn't need to engage with other agencies for the purpose of securing the scholarship
11/10/23, 9:49 am - Sagar: Edoofa provides scholarships for higher education, which includes assistance with the university application process, securing scholarships, and career guidance. Edoofa's goal is to offer students an opportunity to pursue their education abroad with the support of scholarships and mentorship. <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 229 7277: noted thank you
11/10/23, 11:14 am - Sagar: May I know about the particular field of Engineering that Kudakwashe would like to study?
11/10/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 229 7277: that is the sad part
11/10/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 717 7093: Civil
Engineering
11/10/23, 11:28 am - Sagar: Let me brief you on the course of Civil Engineering in depth!
11/10/23, 11:28 am - Sagar: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
11/10/23, 5:01 pm - Sagar: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*

12/10/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 229 7277: Good morning sir!
12/10/23, 9:55 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Once you face your fear, nothing is ever as hard as you think."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 229 7277: Enlightening ! I greatly value and appreciate your efforts in giving us a better understanding of the journey we are about to take. Sometimes we choose degree programs without  having full information about the course of study.   I got a  clearer view of what my son wants to persue and l hope through your career guidance and mentorship he will be able to choose the field he wants to specialise on
12/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 229 7277: It is reassuring and motivating to watch your interviews with Edoofians particularly Wadzanai. I am confident that in the event that Kudakwashe gets a scholarship  with you l will not have to worry about his welfare in a foreign land . The interviews made me appreciate Edoofa even more for creating a conducive environment for Africans staying and studying in India.
12/10/23, 10:40 am - Sagar: I'm delighted to hear that you found the information valuable and that it has given you a clearer view of your son's aspirations and the path he wishes to pursue in his education. Edoofa is committed to providing comprehensive career guidance and mentorship to help students make informed decisions about their academic and career goals.
12/10/23, 10:40 am - Sagar: Did you understand the course properly?
12/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 229 7277: yes ,,,, understood
12/10/23, 11:39 am - Sagar: @263772297277 @263777177093 , now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
12/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 717 7093: Yes sir was also waiting to hear that from you
12/10/23, 11:50 am - Sagar: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons

12/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Thank you for shading more light . Everything is clear.
12/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 229 7277: How many semesters do you have per year
12/10/23, 1:21 pm - Sagar: @263772297277 we have two semesters per year
12/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 229 7277: And in the event that the scholarship is not 100 percent how do we pay  for the  balance?  Any payment plan? Can the total payment per year be divided into semesters?
12/10/23, 1:30 pm - Sagar: @263772297277 let me explain it to you for your better understanding!

so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
12/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Thank you for sharing. Indeed this is a great  opportunity for my son than l thought
12/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 229 7277: no
12/10/23, 1:48 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
12/10/23, 1:48 pm - Sagar: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/10/23, 1:48 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Noted !  lt's clearer now
12/10/23, 2:21 pm - Sagar: Well Please I would like you to be informed that the University evaluates the scholarship amount basis on the following points.

1. Academic 
2. Merit
3. Extra-Curricular Activities. 
4. Statement of purpose.
5. Recommendation from Edoofa.
12/10/23, 2:21 pm - Sagar: This message was deleted
12/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 229 7277: So basically the short falls will be on university expenses food and accommodation
12/10/23, 2:22 pm - Sagar: Now you see @263772297277 , the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

*So for example*, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
12/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 229 7277: My battery is about to die. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience . Will respond as soon as l charge my phone . We do not have electricity at the moment
12/10/23, 2:26 pm - Sagar: Alright, please
12/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 229 7277: ok noted
12/10/23, 4:11 pm - Sagar: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
12/10/23, 4:42 pm - Sagar: I'm eager to keep our conversation going, but it's been quite a day, and my work hours have come to a close. Let's pick up where we left off *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* with fresh energy and ideas.

Have a restful night,
Blessings to you!

13/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 229 7277: Good morning sir.      Thank you for the encouragement. We are still experiencing power cuts and our network is poor.  Please bear with us our responses might delay a bit .On another note, tomorrow we will be at church  we won't be available
13/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 229 7277: On one interview l watched on YouTube , one Edoofian highlighted that she wad given blankets to use at university by Edoofa . So l wanted to ask if that applies to every student under your scholarship
13/10/23, 11:57 am - Sagar: That is alright, I can understand
13/10/23, 12:06 pm - Sagar: @263772297277 May I know which video are you referring to here, please?
13/10/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 229 7277: https://youtu.be/YvTdmAUfJr4?si=fTVJbwpmOUhJDnef
13/10/23, 1:05 pm - Sagar: @263772297277 , I am glad you are watching all the videos, we try our best to support our students! <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 229 7277: I must say, I was overwhelmed watching your interviews. Indeed you are doing a great job !
13/10/23, 2:44 pm - Sagar: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
13/10/23, 2:44 pm - Sagar: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
13/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Well explained !  Really loved the  E W Y L program. Most universities only equip students with theoretical framework rather than it's practical application. As l was reading some of the documents you sent before , l loved the ldea that during exam time the students can solely concentrate on their studies. Amongst other reasons E W Y L makes Edoofa  an outstanding scholarship.
13/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Does a student with 100 percent scholarship benefit financially from  E W Y L?
13/10/23, 3:43 pm - Sagar: Thank you for your positive feedback regarding the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program. It's indeed a unique and valuable aspect of the Edoofa scholarship.
13/10/23, 3:44 pm - Sagar: Students with 100 percent scholarships do benefit from the EWYL program. Even if a student has a full scholarship that covers their tuition and other expenses, they can still participate in the EWYL program to gain valuable work experience and earn scholarship credits, which can be used for various purposes.
13/10/23, 4:20 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 7:52 am - +263 77 229 7277: Good evening  Tomorrow we will be at church we won't be available our apology

16/10/23, 2:57 pm - Sagar: Greetings @263772297277 
I hope you are doing well!

16/10/23, 3:13 pm - Sagar: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/10/23, 3:13 pm - Sagar: *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
* How to network like a boss - by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
* How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer - by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
* It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship - by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
* Decoding the science of personal branding - by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
16/10/23, 3:13 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit your child?*
16/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 229 7277: I continue to hold in high regard the earn while you learn program. It will not only benefit  my son with scholarship credits but I strongly believe that it will also boost his career prospects as he gain skills and professional experience as he will be given a platform to apply knowledge acquired from school
16/10/23, 4:14 pm - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/10/23, 4:14 pm - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/10/23, 4:15 pm - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your child's international education?
16/10/23, 4:35 pm - Sagar: @263713595826@263772297277 are we connected?
16/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 229 7277: This exceeds my expectations with our economic situations here in Zimbabwe,  l have always been worried about my son ' s education and how l will be able to pay for it. I feel so relieved learning about the E W Y L program
16/10/23, 4:50 pm - Sagar: That is great to know @263772297277
16/10/23, 4:50 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Being a farmer myself. , l have instilli values of hard work in Kudakwashe and the E W Y L program really upholds my belief  in being industrious
16/10/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 229 7277: This message was deleted
16/10/23, 5:04 pm - Sagar: @263772297277 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 229 7277: our network is poor but im here sir
16/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 229 7277: following
16/10/23, 5:42 pm - Sagar: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/10/23, 6:47 pm - Sagar: Dear Students and Parents,

I hope this message finds you well.

 I understand that not everyone can join our morning sessions due to various commitments. *To ensure that I can assist all of you, I will be available for a night session.*

Let's have a discussion tonight. Your success is our top priority, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. *Usually, my working hours are over by now, but I'm extending them to accommodate your needs.*
16/10/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 717 7093: Thank you very much for that
16/10/23, 7:02 pm - Sagar: You're welcome, @263777177093
16/10/23, 7:03 pm - Sagar: I am waiting for you to answer this question so that we can proceed ahead!
16/10/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 717 7093: $1500-$2250
16/10/23, 7:25 pm - Sagar: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/10/23, 7:26 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 717 7093: Okay thank you so much for that
16/10/23, 7:38 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
16/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 717 7093: This looks great
16/10/23, 9:23 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 717 7093: Okay thank yoi
16/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 717 7093: You**
16/10/23, 9:24 pm - Sagar: Kudakwashe, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
16/10/23, 9:24 pm - Sagar: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/10/23, 9:31 pm - Sagar: @263777177093 are we connected?
16/10/23, 9:52 pm - Sagar: @263777177093 I am waiting for your response!
16/10/23, 10:18 pm - Sagar: @263777177093 we are about to conclude the session, I would like you to come onlin so that we can conclude today's session.
16/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 717 7093: Noted with thanks
16/10/23, 10:24 pm - Sagar: I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
16/10/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 717 7093: Okay understood
16/10/23, 10:24 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 10:24 pm - Sagar: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
16/10/23, 10:24 pm - Sagar: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/10/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 717 7093: Yes yes
16/10/23, 10:27 pm - Sagar: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/10/23, 10:27 pm - Sagar: So let me tell you that the next step After you are done interacting with the university you will receive your offer letter( UNIVERSITY ACCEPTANCE LETTER) from the university where your fee and scholarship will be mentioned and the university will give you a few week's time to make the payment of registration fee. Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025).
16/10/23, 10:27 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
16/10/23, 10:27 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 717 7093: Okay noted
16/10/23, 10:35 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
16/10/23, 10:35 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

Are you clear about the same?
18/10/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 777 2056: 1.Kudakwashe wants to study civil engineering.
18/10/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 777 2056: 2.He will be studying in India through the Edoofa program.

18/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 777 2056: 6.The EWYL program is an initiative by Edoofa on which students are assigned with online projects during which they gain, skills, work experience whilst earning scholarship credits. The credits will be redeemed to pay part of the fees, accommodation and food. It is also entirely based on the performance and consistency of the student. Students have to constantly ask for assignments and  projects to improve their performance.The program has been appreciated by alot of companies and market leaders in India.

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *25th or 26th of October 2023* for $200 and the *25th or 26th of November 2023* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *25th or 26th of October 2023*

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

23/10/23, 8:49 am - +263 77 777 2056: yes we are
23/10/23, 8:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: So I Hope you have been following the session so far?
23/10/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 777 2056: yes sir
23/10/23, 10:09 am - Shubham Madhwal: So please, I hope you have gone through Kudakwashe's acceptance letter?
23/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 777 2056: yes
23/10/23, 10:49 am - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentioned in the acceptance letter?
23/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 777 2056: 27 October... and if we choose to pay $200 first the remaining  $150 should be paid before 27 November
23/10/23, 11:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, you are correct, and are you aware of the transaction methods as well?
23/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 777 2056: yes we are.... just putting our finances together and go to deposit. Maybe if you can clarity on the question above.
23/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 777 2056: here.
23/10/23, 12:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, Let me help you understand the same better
23/10/23, 12:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
23/10/23, 3:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected?
23/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 777 2056: Which one is easier and cheaper?
23/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 777 2056: 1 or 2?
23/10/23, 3:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
23/10/23, 3:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738

23/10/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions you would like to ask
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: ?
23/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Afternoon When we deposit  ,do we sent proof of payment?
23/10/23, 4:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Have you completed the formalities?
23/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Not yet sir expecting to do that latest Friday
23/10/23, 4:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please as you are aware, there are severe Network Issues in Zimbabwe in some regions because of which the bank sometimes faces server issues so Payment isn't made on the same day, Instead, it takes 2-3 additional days from the bank's end. 

So we recommend parents to try and pay a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and the parents do not miss the deadline for enrolling their child!
23/10/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Thanks for the advice
23/10/23, 5:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So knowing this, when would  you proceed with the  formalities now?

24/10/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 777 2056: Ooh ok... noted!
24/10/23, 8:51 am - Shubham Madhwal: Are there any other questions please?

24/10/23, 9:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year.
