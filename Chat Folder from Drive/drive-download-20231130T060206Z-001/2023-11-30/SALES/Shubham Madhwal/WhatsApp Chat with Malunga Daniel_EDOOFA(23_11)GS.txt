23/11/23, 12:25 pm - Sagar: Good Morning Daniel, Mr. and Mrs.Malunga!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
23/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Hello how are you sir
23/11/23, 12:31 pm - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Daniel,

You can address me as Mr Singh, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay thank you Mr Singh
23/11/23, 12:45 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Daniel, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Lyvinia, is that correct?
23/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yess it's correct
23/11/23, 1:14 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Lyvinia, also do tell me whether you learnt about Lyvinia’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
23/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 765 8374: The *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is an innovative program managed by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.  The program helps African students to acquire Quality International Tertiary Education, leading them with opportunities to self sponsor in the most affordable way possible.
23/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Students also get to *engage in projects* that are *aimed at career and skill development* , *Network broadening* along with *The Earn While You Learn Program*.
23/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sagar: Great answer Daniel, I can see you are well informed.
23/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sagar: Let me also brief you about the program.
23/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/11/23, 1:30 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/11/23, 1:30 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 765 8374: No l haven't heard about Lyvinia's journey and experience
23/11/23, 1:33 pm - Sagar added +263 77 904 1204
23/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yess that is absolutely correct
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sagar: Okay so Daniel, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
23/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes I think I do
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sagar: Alright so Daniel, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
23/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay
23/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 765 8374: I'm Daniel Malunga  a boy aged 18 and I've just finished writing my Advanced level exams . l was doing Maths , Physics , Geography and Statistics

27/11/23, 1:18 pm - Sagar: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Tech Civil Engineering*
27/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay thank you sir I would be happy to do that
27/11/23, 1:42 pm - Sagar: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 1:42 pm - Sagar: So should I brief you about the course?
27/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes please
27/11/23, 1:46 pm - Sagar: Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.
27/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*
27/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field.
27/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: *Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
27/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay thank you,  I've understood
27/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
27/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
27/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes I am l think I'll get higher points
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - Sagar: That is great, now since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yesss l am let me tell you
27/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 765 8374: The eddofa program can help me in my studies and my dreams after 5 yrs are as follows 

After 5 years of doing civil engineering, l could see myself in a variety of different roles and positions within the industry. With the right experience and expertise, l could advance to become project managers, construction managers, or even pursue a career in structural engineering or urban planning.

I may also find myself working on larger and more complex projects, such as highways, bridges, or high-rise buildings. I may have the opportunity to work on projects in different parts of the world, gaining international experience and exposure to different engineering practices and regulations.

Alternatively, after gaining sufficient experience, l may choose to start their own engineering firm or consultancy, offering me expertise to clients and building a reputation in the industry.

Additionally, after 5 years, l may have had the opportunity to obtain professional certifications and licenses, further solidifying their expertise and credibility within the field.

Overall, after 5 years of doing civil engineering, l could see myself in a variety of challenging and rewarding roles, with the potential for career advancement, professional growth, and exciting opportunities within the industry.
27/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Sorry about the number of words I wanted to express all my dreams
27/11/23, 4:21 pm - Sagar: That is really great Daniel I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yess l am fully dedicated and willing to give all my best into this
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 765 8374: My mother's hard work also motivates me and l also want to change where l come from
27/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 765 8374: My country has no exposure to certain things
27/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 765 8374: For example our laboratories are outdated and equipments are malfunctioning
27/11/23, 4:26 pm - Sagar: Very good Daniel.
27/11/23, 4:27 pm - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Thank you sir
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes l wish to do that especially in my rural areas,  the situation there is very tense
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - Sagar: Please address this.
27/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay l would mainly like to renovate laboratories supply them with equipments
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Daniel, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
27/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yess that is correct
27/11/23, 4:36 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
27/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yeah I wonder why
27/11/23, 4:40 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
27/11/23, 4:40 pm - Sagar: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

28/11/23, 9:09 am - +263 71 765 8374: Good morning
28/11/23, 9:17 am - Sagar: Alright, let us continue the session.
28/11/23, 9:17 am - Sagar: So now Daniel, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
28/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Mmm not really
28/11/23, 12:04 pm - +263 71 765 8374: But I would like to know when is my intake
28/11/23, 12:06 pm - Sagar: Let us be patient in this counselling session as every concern of you for this topic will be cleared ahead.
28/11/23, 12:06 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
28/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 765 8374: No they are not
28/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
28/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.* <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 12:14 pm - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/11/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay l see
28/11/23, 12:18 pm - Sagar: In simple words Daniel what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 765 8374: What does the earn while you learn program do
28/11/23, 12:20 pm - Sagar: Daniel, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/11/23, 12:29 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?
28/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes sir
28/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay l understand
28/11/23, 12:37 pm - Sagar: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

28/11/23, 12:37 pm - Sagar: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
28/11/23, 12:37 pm - Sagar: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

28/11/23, 12:37 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
28/11/23, 12:38 pm - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Oooh  , okay thanks I'm now aware
28/11/23, 12:44 pm - Sagar: Please address this.
28/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yeah I probably think I'll benefit from this program
28/11/23, 12:46 pm - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that Daniel, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay , and l as an individual I'm willing to work hard
28/11/23, 12:51 pm - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/11/23, 12:52 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 12:52 pm - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
28/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yess absolutely
28/11/23, 12:56 pm - Sagar: Daniel, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
28/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yeah I can see
28/11/23, 12:57 pm - Sagar: Alright Daniel, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
28/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yess they are
28/11/23, 1:01 pm - Sagar: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
28/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes l have discussed with them
28/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 765 8374: I've also told them everything about edoofa
28/11/23, 1:04 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
28/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes I'm ready
28/11/23, 1:06 pm - Sagar: Daniel as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?* <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 765 8374: 1500 -2250 dollars
28/11/23, 1:08 pm - Sagar: Exactly Daniel, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/11/23, 1:09 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay it's fine
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - Sagar: Don’t you think so?
28/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yeah I do
28/11/23, 1:13 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay you can do so
28/11/23, 1:14 pm - Sagar: Daniel basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
28/11/23, 1:14 pm - Sagar: However Daniel, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay
28/11/23, 1:17 pm - Sagar: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
28/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Not really
28/11/23, 1:19 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 1:19 pm - Sagar: Alright Daniel, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
28/11/23, 1:19 pm - Sagar: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
28/11/23, 1:19 pm - Sagar: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
28/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Yes I do
28/11/23, 1:24 pm - Sagar: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
28/11/23, 1:24 pm - Sagar: \*After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
28/11/23, 1:24 pm - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
28/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay what if my my parents can't afford to find the 350 dollars
28/11/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: Elaborate the question.
28/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay the part when you said about paying $350 programme fee , what can I do if my parent cannot raise it within the stated period
28/11/23, 1:30 pm - Sagar: As to ease the financial burden Daniel, we have given you the option to pay in two parts.
28/11/23, 1:32 pm - Sagar: And to address your concern completely I would suggest you be patient as after this counselling session, Mr.Shubham, our senior academician will have a session with you.
28/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 765 8374: Okay fine
28/11/23, 1:35 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
28/11/23, 1:35 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
28/11/23, 1:35 pm - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

29/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So *Mrs Malunga*, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.
