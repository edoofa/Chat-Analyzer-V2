For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

16/10/23, 3:13 pm - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination
16/10/23, 3:13 pm - Tushti: You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

16/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Thank u so much I have read and understood evrything about Edoofa
16/10/23, 3:33 pm - Tushti: The information is about India, not Edoofa
16/10/23, 3:33 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
16/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Ok sorry
16/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 295 0153: No
16/10/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
16/10/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/10/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/10/23, 3:46 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 3:46 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/10/23, 3:46 pm - Tushti: In simple words @263772950153 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Uu that's very reasonable can aford that
16/10/23, 4:04 pm - Tushti: So now if you have no further questions, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
16/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 295 0153: It's ok
16/10/23, 4:12 pm - Tushti: @263772950153 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/10/23, 4:12 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/10/23, 4:12 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/10/23, 4:13 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 4:13 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
16/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Thank u
16/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 295 0153: That's great
16/10/23, 4:25 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes
16/10/23, 4:28 pm - Tushti: @263772950153 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 295 0153: About 1500 which is expensive
16/10/23, 4:31 pm - Tushti: Exactly @263772950153 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/10/23, 4:32 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 4:32 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 295 0153: It's ok
16/10/23, 4:38 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/10/23, 4:38 pm - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
16/10/23, 4:39 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/10/23, 4:39 pm - Tushti: Are you able to understand?
16/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Yes
16/10/23, 4:40 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
16/10/23, 4:40 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 4:41 pm - Tushti: Alright @263772950153 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
16/10/23, 4:41 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/10/23, 4:41 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/10/23, 4:41 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
16/10/23, 4:41 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
16/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 295 0153: No I have head evrything,and understand I will be ready for the next session
16/10/23, 4:45 pm - Tushti: Great
16/10/23, 4:46 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/10/23, 4:46 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session.*
16/10/23, 4:46 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

26/10/23, 9:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, Let me get this correct stand share the letter with you shortly!

26/10/23, 9:41 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 9:48 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Mr Tsiga, Please I hope you have gone through the corrected letter?
26/10/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 295 0153: Yes
26/10/23, 10:03 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, So are there any questions you would like to ask?
26/10/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 295 0153: No fo now
26/10/23, 10:10 am - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentioned in Sharmaine's acceptance letter?
26/10/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 290 4641: Correct
26/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 290 4641: Payment of $200 US on Monday 30th
26/10/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 295 0153: And 150 end of november
26/10/23, 10:29 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please correct, And are you aware of the  transaction methods?
26/10/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 290 4641: Give us the easiest & cheaper method
26/10/23, 10:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright, Let me guide you with the same!
26/10/23, 10:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
26/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 290 4641: Direct to parent company
26/10/23, 11:06 am - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
26/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 295 0153: Ok noted ,,thank u
26/10/23, 12:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

27/10/23, 3:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted, @263772950153, you see the only reason I was seeking an update from you was. since I am well aware that in Zimbabwe there are severe Network Issues in Zimbabwe in a lot of regions because of which the bank sometimes faces server issues so in the past there have been parents who had to miss their deadline because their fees couldn't be completed on the same day of the due date, Instead, it took additional 2-3 days which delayed the overall progress of their child's admission.
27/10/23, 3:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As your counsellor, I can only recommend you to try and complete the formalities a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and you as parents do not have to be stressed regarding the same!
27/10/23, 3:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So if I may ask so far do you need my help with anything, please?
27/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 295 0153: I think monday is best  it's 30 which is a day before the 31st,

27/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please!
27/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So today's session is regarding doubt clarification, you can share your questions with me if you would like to ask regarding any aspect.
27/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Ok sir
27/10/23, 5:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

27/10/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 295 0153: Ok thank u
27/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 290 4641: Dr Abhinav he says is the program director ... He has sent this 👇
27/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 290 4641: Good Evening
27/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 290 4641: Attention Dear Parent
I am *Dr. Abhinav* the Program Director at the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Your child’s application is still pending with us lying on my table.  
You must consider the following facts while enrolling your child in the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
27/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 290 4641: 1. The current economic situation in Zimbabawe is not under control you know the exchange rates of the local currency are at an all-time high.  
2. The Inflation rates have taken a new height people are distressed by the rising costs of essential commodities.  The price for a maize bucket that you used to pay is almost going to be double the Poultry has increased over three times. 
3. After ELECTIONS you can see the uncertainty of everything. Can’t comment more on ZIM Politics.
4. The Cost of Education at NUST, Bindura, UZ, and others stands at RTGS 550000- RTGS 650000 per term just the tuition. This is going to increase this year(You know with ZANU PF in power what percentage increase is expected). The Food and Accommodation outside the campus is USD 800 per year. Parents are spending USD2000 and more with no guarantee of Jobs.
27/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 290 4641: We have an existing community of 1600 Parents some of whom were working as seasonal farmers some of them doing daily wages jobs however have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship Program studying in India. *For them, this was just like a dream but they believed the process*.
27/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 290 4641: *Reserve the seat for your child we have seats at the best Universities available*. 
Your child can complete education at a Semester fee (Each of Six Months) of only USD 500-&750 with the assistance of EWYL including Food and accommodation. So,
Even if you manage USD $80 per month for your child, paying for foreign tertiary education is seamless and affordable. 
*Give me confirmation if you are paying TOMORROW so that I hold a Seat for your child, I am at the University TOMORROW* WE HAVE the last SIX Seats left. Speaking up is better than seeing your child selling air time tickets and having no jobs after spending USD 2000 in ZIM.
27/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 290 4641: Sharmaine programme is on next year . And he is talking of a seat .. for transport or are we missing a point somewhere .. may comment on Dr Abhinav please ..
27/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 290 4641: You know as Parents you come up with so much excitement and keep saying yes to things. Now when the child is selected for this prestigious scholarship you as parents choose to be silent and keep ignoring messages. You should commit and tell us that this was an experiment and this was not a part of a serious attempt, we will be more than happy to see your child getting educated in Zimbabawe.  At least give an acknowledgment so that we cancel the application of your child.
27/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 290 4641: I think the Dr is not aware on what we have agreed on with you
27/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 290 4641: Halllooo
27/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Mr Tsiga

27/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 290 4641: We are not against enrolling early we got worried .. when Mrs Tsiga had indicated we are paying $200 US by Monday and the Dr is talking of tomorrow And is saying there are 6 seats left
