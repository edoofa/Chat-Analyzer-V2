28/11/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Innocent,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Well,my family is really aware of this and they agreed to support me on  both mentally and financially.
28/11/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: That's great
28/11/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
28/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Its alright mam no problem with that.
28/11/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Business ?
28/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Well, do you mind if I can send my O level results immediately in   February when the certificates are out unfortunately my transcript was misplaced I hope you understand .
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: You can type them for now please, Innocent

28/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, I await your response to the remaining part.
28/11/23, 9:03 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Thursday at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
