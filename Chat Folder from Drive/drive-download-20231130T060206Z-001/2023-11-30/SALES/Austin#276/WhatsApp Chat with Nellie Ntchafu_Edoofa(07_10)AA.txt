So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
10/10/23, 11:53 am - +265 993 65 25 42: In india the formal education system consists of four if not five years of primary schooling, followed by three years of middle school and then two years of high school if am not mistaken According to the research I did after that you go pursue at college or university level
10/10/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding.
10/10/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
10/10/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
10/10/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
10/10/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
10/10/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
10/10/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
10/10/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
10/10/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.

10/10/23, 11:59 am - +265 993 65 25 42: Oooh really! Wow
10/10/23, 11:59 am - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
10/10/23, 12:10 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: As you've said that india is the home to the World's second-largest higher education system and that the universities are well-ranked and climbing
This can motivate me to work very hard to be the best and to acquire more skills and most importantly be employable and being dependent.
10/10/23, 12:10 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
10/10/23, 12:10 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Will try to be the best and always have the heart to learn new things
10/10/23, 12:11 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Have just heard that it is very expensive that someone like me can't afford I don't know the actual cost
10/10/23, 12:14 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
10/10/23, 12:14 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 12:14 pm - Arshita: In simple words Emerson what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
10/10/23, 12:18 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Can I ask
10/10/23, 12:18 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Something
10/10/23, 12:19 pm - Arshita: Sure
10/10/23, 12:21 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Apart from the fees tripping down.....can you cover all the expenses like 100% scholarship?
10/10/23, 12:23 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Andnisnit possible for a student to be learning and working at the same time inorder for them to pay the other fees
10/10/23, 12:24 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: And is it*
10/10/23, 12:25 pm - Arshita: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
10/10/23, 12:26 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: I would love to kno
10/10/23, 12:27 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Know*
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
10/10/23, 12:32 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes 

Here I will be able to gain some skill, experience as well

At the same time you are not advising laziness

I like this!
10/10/23, 12:34 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: And also I won't give my parents the stress as well because most of the people here in Malawi they think Education in India is very expensive
10/10/23, 12:37 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
10/10/23, 12:37 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 12:39 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: As long as am willing to work hard I quote that
10/10/23, 12:40 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes..very well
10/10/23, 12:45 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
10/10/23, 12:45 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
10/10/23, 12:45 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
10/10/23, 12:45 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
10/10/23, 12:46 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
10/10/23, 12:46 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
10/10/23, 12:48 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Sorry I wanna ask another question if it is possible?
10/10/23, 12:49 pm - Arshita: Sure
10/10/23, 12:51 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: So for example I have been picked to go study in india with your scholarship and as you've said that  you do 50-100% of scholarship so what if you take the 80% and an remaining with twenty and am in my first semester are my parents responsible for the 20%
10/10/23, 12:52 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: ????
10/10/23, 12:52 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Or is it per year and in that period if time I start working?
10/10/23, 12:52 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Of*
10/10/23, 12:56 pm - Arshita: Nelli yes, for 20% you will be responsible. 

You can avail the benefits of EWYL program to cover such costume
10/10/23, 12:56 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Alright
10/10/23, 12:56 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
10/10/23, 12:56 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: I like this point
10/10/23, 12:57 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Point number 4
10/10/23, 1:01 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

10/10/23, 1:02 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Sure
10/10/23, 1:03 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Wow! This is nice

I wish this is me
10/10/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
10/10/23, 1:06 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: My parents
10/10/23, 1:07 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
10/10/23, 1:15 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Upon explaining everything to them. They feel it's ok for me to go study abroad as log as it is fair
10/10/23, 1:17 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Long*
10/10/23, 1:17 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
10/10/23, 1:17 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
10/10/23, 1:17 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
10/10/23, 1:18 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes it is.
10/10/23, 1:19 pm - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 12:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule. 

Meanwhile you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

10/10/23, 1:20 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Alright
10/10/23, 2:15 pm - Arshita: Thank you for waiting! 

Are we good to continue?
10/10/23, 2:17 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes we are
10/10/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
10/10/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
10/10/23, 2:20 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:20 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
10/10/23, 2:22 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes please
10/10/23, 2:25 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
10/10/23, 2:25 pm - Arshita: However Nellie, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
10/10/23, 2:26 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Oooh ok
10/10/23, 2:28 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their MSCE result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final MSCE results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
10/10/23, 2:31 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Oooh ok following
10/10/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Stage 5 i think
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: No Nellie, we have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Oooh yes
10/10/23, 2:37 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: Yes very clear
10/10/23, 2:37 pm - Arshita: Do you have any questions?
10/10/23, 2:38 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: No
10/10/23, 2:39 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

11/10/23, 5:08 pm - +265 993 65 25 42: I am writing to you as a grateful recipient of the Edoofa Scholarship program to seek clarification regarding the type and coverage of the scholarship.
I am deeply appreciative of the privilege of receiving this scholarship and the opportunities it provides for my educational journey. In this regard, I would like to inquire about the specific type of scholarship that has been awarded to me.
Furthermore, I would like to express my sincere preference for a full scholarship, should that be an option within the scope of the Edoofa Scholarship program. If it is possible for me to be considered for a full scholarship that covers tuition fees, accommodation, textbooks, and other related educational costs, I would greatly appreciate your guidance in this matter.
I understand that the availability of full scholarships may vary, but I wanted to convey my preference and explore the possibilities.
Your assistance and support are highly valued, and I look forward to your response. Please feel free to contact me, if you require any additional information or clarification from my end.

12/10/23, 9:48 am - Austin#276: I do understand and thank you for opening up, Nellie!
Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship is a partially funded scholarship offering up to 100% scholarships on Tuition fees
12/10/23, 9:49 am - Austin#276: The costs can be further reduced through the Earn While you Learn Program and remaining is supposed to be catered by your family
12/10/23, 9:50 am - +265 993 65 25 42: Ooh ok 

So we want you to clarify is on this question
12/10/23, 9:58 am - +265 993 65 25 42: Us*
12/10/23, 10:03 am - Austin#276: Sure, as per your understandings from the sessions, 
1. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

2. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

3. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?
12/10/23, 10:07 am - +265 993 65 25 42: 6000-8000 dollars without EDOOFA scholarship
With EDOOFA scholarship it trips down to 2000-3000 dollars
12/10/23, 10:08 am - +265 993 65 25 42: The enrollment fee is 350 dollar you can pay in installments that's 200 in 7 days and 150 later
12/10/23, 10:20 am - +265 880 52 93 16: In short as a family,we are ok with the fees through Edoofa,but we still need more clarification from you on how the fees shall be paid,.
12/10/23, 10:30 am - Austin#276: This is correct, based on your performance in the upcoming interviews and evaluations of our Academic Board, you can even receive a higher quantum of scholarship after which the cost of education can further be reduced to $1500-$2300 per annum. <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 10:31 am - Austin#276: The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
12/10/23, 10:31 am - Austin#276: This can be further reduced through the Earn While You Learn Program
12/10/23, 10:32 am - +265 880 52 93 16: Well noted
12/10/23, 10:33 am - Austin#276: In short, the cost of education can be reduced to less than that of Malawi with much more exposure and practical learning opportunities so that the child is job ready by the time of graduation
12/10/23, 10:35 am - +265 880 52 93 16: Well understood boss
12/10/23, 10:36 am - +265 993 65 25 42: Noted
12/10/23, 10:43 am - Austin#276: Glad to know
12/10/23, 10:43 am - Austin#276: Are you having other questions for me please?
12/10/23, 10:49 am - +265 993 65 25 42: For now we don't have any
12/10/23, 10:53 am - +265 880 52 93 16: For now ,no sir.
12/10/23, 11:08 am - Austin#276: So Nellie, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

4. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
12/10/23, 11:25 am - +265 993 65 25 42: 1. Bachelor in Business Administration (BBM)
 
2. It's been my dream to study in India

3. I understand the earn while you earn program is the backbone of EDOOFA and the unique aspect of the program. This program helps the students to bring down their fees and makes it affordable for themselves. It is a program where the students are given an opportunity to work or do some online projects to gain experience and an opportunity to earn scholarship credits and this is based on the students performance and this program helps students to learn and develop skills necessary for the workplace.

4. Yes very clear

12/10/23, 11:28 am - Austin#276: <Media omitted>

15/10/23, 7:33 pm - Austin#276: Please excuse me for the incorrect greetings, Mr&Mrs Ntchafu
15/10/23, 7:34 pm - Austin#276: I really appreciate your support for your child's career!
15/10/23, 7:40 pm - +265 992 38 02 17: Thanks mr Austin and the entire edoofa team for granting my daughter this opportunity, we look forward to offer our support  for the university.Some our questions has been answered in your offer letter for instance as to when the semister begins i understand its August next year.But may be just to know the exact name of the university where she is going to attend her studies?.
15/10/23, 7:43 pm - +265 992 38 02 17: And also clarify on offer percentage because the letter indicates the range of 60 to 100.
15/10/23, 7:44 pm - Austin#276: Please note that our parent organization has worked with 250+ reputed Universities and Colleges in India. For your research and learnings let me share with you the details of some of our associate Universities

*Lovely Professional University* 

*Galgotias University* 

*MVN University* 

*Jagran Lakecity University*

*Gulzar Group of Institutes(GGI)* 

*Colleges under Punjab Technical University*

Nellie will go through sessions regarding the Universities after which she will be receiving offer letters from multiple reputed Universities. You will have the liberty to choose the University from them.
15/10/23, 7:48 pm - Austin#276: Nellie has qualified for a 60-100% scholarship on tuition fees and Accommodation, The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided during the sessions related to Universities of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship which would be mentioned on the Offer letter.
15/10/23, 7:50 pm - +265 992 38 02 17: So the selection into the university's,its another separate process?.And that she can be able to know in advance before visiting india as well?.And for the paying process we agreed to extend the period considering the shortage of forex in our land,i hope this consideration still remains and you will confirm through this our conversation.
15/10/23, 7:52 pm - Austin#276: Yes, it is a separate process. After the enrollment , our Admissions team will guide Nellie drafting her application, Statment of Purpose and initiating the Earn While You Learn Program
15/10/23, 7:53 pm - Austin#276: Absolutely, the process happens before her intake itself. You need the Admissions Acceptance Letter form the University for the visa process. Therefore, all the process happens while being in Malawi
15/10/23, 7:55 pm - Austin#276: We are aware of the forex shortages and challenges in the nation. There is a solution here too. You can visit your bank in Malawi and fill out the telegraphic transfer form and deposit the amount after which the amount will be transferred within 2-4 days. Education is being given priority and parents have even paid last week through the process. Will this solve the challenge for you?
15/10/23, 8:01 pm - +265 992 38 02 17: Ok thanks for guidance.I hope we will continue getting in touch but reaching this far i say thank you for this opportunity and its my sincere hope that after fanalising everything my daughter will be safe and secure while attaining her education in your land.But otherwise thank you so very much for granting her this opportunity for her brighter future the onus is on us now to do the needfull within the given period.
15/10/23, 8:11 pm - Austin#276: You are most welcome, and we ensure to provide the best opportunities to Edoofians for their academic and personal development
