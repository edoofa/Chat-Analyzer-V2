I would also like to inform you that the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough for resources and study materials, due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting. Therefore, after the evaluations, the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about him achieving it

23/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 271 6627: The students will also learn that money is earned we don't just wake up with money in the pocket
23/09/23, 10:38 am - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
23/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 271 6627: It's very good indeed it makes the fees lower and hence affordable
23/09/23, 10:43 am - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
23/09/23, 10:43 am - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
23/09/23, 10:43 am - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
23/09/23, 10:43 am - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
23/09/23, 10:43 am - Kunal: After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
23/09/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 271 6627: Number 3-"Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world"
23/09/23, 11:01 am - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

23/09/23, 11:01 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Tinashe with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
23/09/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 271 6627: I will be helping Tinashe
23/09/23, 11:05 am - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
23/09/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 271 6627: Feel like he is already there. I like it. It's very very good. I just pray he will be successful
23/09/23, 11:12 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make him career advance at even a greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
23/09/23, 11:12 am - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
23/09/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 271 6627: Ok that's good. So where do we get the application forms
23/09/23, 11:38 am - Kunal: Let me guide you ahead
23/09/23, 11:38 am - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
23/09/23, 11:38 am - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
23/09/23, 11:38 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
23/09/23, 12:01 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
23/09/23, 12:09 pm - +263 77 271 6627: That's good
23/09/23, 12:09 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes please
23/09/23, 12:11 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/09/23, 12:11 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
23/09/23, 12:11 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Ok understood
23/09/23, 12:17 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
23/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 271 6627: We have discussed up to stage 2
23/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
23/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes please
23/09/23, 12:38 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
23/09/23, 12:38 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
23/09/23, 12:38 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
23/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Very clear. You have been explaining everything clearly
23/09/23, 12:50 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
23/09/23, 12:50 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
23/09/23, 12:50 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

25/09/23, 12:38 pm - Austin#276: What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me please?
25/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Edoofa is a good programme from what I learnt so far
25/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Any accommodation at the campus. How is the general cost of living in India?
25/09/23, 1:09 pm - Austin#276: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
25/09/23, 1:10 pm - Austin#276: There are two options for Accommodation from which you are free to choose. 

1) Campus Accommodation- Students live in hostels inside the University premises. You are free to choose the type of hostel rooms and the seaters. There are single-seaters, two-seaters and more. 

2) Outside Campus-Accommodation is arranged in apartments outside the University campus. It is close to Universities and cheaper than on-campus

After the University Sessions, you will be given these options and can choose from them
25/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Ok thank you
25/09/23, 2:08 pm - Austin#276: You are welcome, what else would you like to ask me please?
25/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 271 6627: At the moment no questions   but if any pops up I will ask
25/09/23, 2:53 pm - Austin#276: That is fine
So may I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
25/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 271 6627: As explained in the first stage I have seen that you are doing all the best for us to have affordable fees which is commendable. I have seen that it makes the cost of education affordable
25/09/23, 3:20 pm - Austin#276: Thank you for the good words, Mr Munashe and I appreciate your support for Tinashe!
25/09/23, 3:20 pm - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 3:20 pm - Austin#276: Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

Along with moral support, financial support is also a significant factor in higher education. We will begin the eligibility check process for your child today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?*. Your acknowledgement is mandatory to proceed and we expect it before the day's end as we are currently overwhelmed with applications.

*Please answer using voice notes*
25/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 271 6627: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 4:08 pm - Austin#276: Thank you for the acknowledgement, Mr Munashe, it has been duly noted
25/09/23, 4:08 pm - Austin#276: Is Tinashe available for a discussion?
25/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Tinashe is at a boarding school and so the boarding school do not allow the children to bring in cellphones. The school is about 250km from home
25/09/23, 4:40 pm - Austin#276: I can understand
As you know, form 6 students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

So all these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Tinashe?*
25/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Yes i am willing
25/09/23, 5:04 pm - Austin#276: I appreciate your willingness!
25/09/23, 5:05 pm - Austin#276: Can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that Tinashe would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will he be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if Tinashe is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
27/09/23, 6:09 am - +263 77 271 6627: Greetings. I am sorry for late response my phone was  stolen the day i last spoke to you i only recovered it late yesterday.
27/09/23, 6:15 am - +263 77 271 6627: 1.Tinashe would be studying Bachelor of business studies  
2.He will be studying in India
3.Average cost of studies in India without a scholarship is $6000 to $8000 per annum
27/09/23, 6:20 am - +263 77 271 6627: 4.The cost would trip down to $2000 to $3000 if found eligible for the program 
5. I am very much clear about the registration fee

06/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 271 6627: The acceptance letter is clear sir. Maybe some questions outside the acceptance letter
06/10/23, 1:31 pm - Austin#276: Sure, please ask them
06/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 271 6627: In Zimbabwe we have freedom of worship. In some countries its not so how is it in India. In some countries you cannot move freely carrying some gadgets like cellphones laptops etc before you are pounced on by armed robbers. In zimbabwe the majority do not own guns. Do universities conduct lectures in the evenings
06/10/23, 1:52 pm - Austin#276: Thank you for these important questions. As mentioned in the session, India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. The constitution of India grants the freedom of *secularism* which means you are free to practice your religion and culture in India. There would be places for worship near the campuses and students can visit them
06/10/23, 1:53 pm - Austin#276: In India, we all move around with gadgets without the fear of robbery. In the Universities, you will observe students freely moving around with the gadgets and it is a normal scene
06/10/23, 1:54 pm - Austin#276: In India, you need to have a licence to own guns. So it is similar to Zimbabwe because majority do not own guns
06/10/23, 1:55 pm - Austin#276: The lecturers usually wrap up by 5-6 PM in the evening. There can be evening sessions only in special cases or events
06/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 271 6627: That's great you are in a peaceful nation. How about the weather, I mean when is it summer, winter etc. How common are weather hazards like cyclones in India
06/10/23, 2:26 pm - Austin#276: The summers are hot and winters are cold. Students will need winter clothes during the months of November to February. The summer starts from March and we receive monsoon showers in the months from June to August
06/10/23, 2:30 pm - Austin#276: Weather hazards aren't common in India, especially in the parts of our Universities.
06/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Ever had some stubborn students from zimbabwe. What did they do that you were very unhappy about that our children should guard against
06/10/23, 2:42 pm - Austin#276: That is another important question,  Mr Munashe, and as you know, Adolescence is an age where children are filled with energy and enthusiasm and it is important that they are channelled towards the right cause. There were times when students weren't participating in the sessions and mentorship programs. But now, we have our Department of Student Welfare at our campuses with direct monitoring and guidance to our Edoofians. Our EWYL team paves frequent visits to ensure Eodoofians are motivated and moves on the right track focussing on their career goals
