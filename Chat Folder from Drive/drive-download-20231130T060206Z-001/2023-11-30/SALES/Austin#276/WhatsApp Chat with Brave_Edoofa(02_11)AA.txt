02/11/23, 10:38 am - +265 992 77 80 23: I did a ton of research concerning foreign education but haven't applied to any.
02/11/23, 10:38 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.

02/11/23, 11:18 am - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
02/11/23, 11:18 am - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students.

02/11/23, 11:28 am - +265 992 77 80 23: Wow. Now I know so much
02/11/23, 11:28 am - +265 992 77 80 23: Will definitely love it there
02/11/23, 11:29 am - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?

02/11/23, 11:36 am - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
02/11/23, 11:39 am - +265 992 77 80 23: Yes
02/11/23, 11:41 am - Arshita: May I know about your knowledge of the same?
02/11/23, 11:44 am - +265 992 77 80 23: Well I know that this deals with living expenses, tuition fees,  health insurance, visa and immigration fees ,study supplies like books and etc, miscellaneous expenses and travel expenses
02/11/23, 11:45 am - +265 992 77 80 23: This is the knowledge I have of it.
02/11/23, 11:53 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/11/23, 11:53 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 11:53 am - Arshita: In simple words Brave what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/11/23, 11:57 am - +265 992 77 80 23: Wow this is so amazing.
02/11/23, 11:57 am - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
02/11/23, 11:58 am - +265 992 77 80 23: Through the earn will you learn program. Yes ?
02/11/23, 12:01 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: While*
02/11/23, 12:01 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
02/11/23, 12:01 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
02/11/23, 12:01 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
02/11/23, 12:01 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
02/11/23, 12:01 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
02/11/23, 12:01 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
02/11/23, 12:01 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 12:01 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
02/11/23, 12:11 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: The program is indeed Important. It does indeed provide students with the ability to acquire success traits and as well become industry ready after education completion. 

I definitely do think that I will be benefitting from it as well.
02/11/23, 12:12 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

02/11/23, 12:15 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Yes now I have better and clear understanding of it.
02/11/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
02/11/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
02/11/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
02/11/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
02/11/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
02/11/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
02/11/23, 12:19 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: I love all the 4. 


I was following through and observing ever since the session started. 

I like them all
02/11/23, 12:21 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

02/11/23, 12:22 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Wow thats amazing. Being inspired
02/11/23, 12:24 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
02/11/23, 12:25 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: My parents, first born brother and as well my aunt here and there.
02/11/23, 12:26 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
02/11/23, 12:27 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: I will talk to them about our today's session. 

Well, my family will be excited to see me study outside. It would be a life changing moment not only for me but for my entire family as a whole.
02/11/23, 12:30 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
02/11/23, 12:30 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
02/11/23, 12:30 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
02/11/23, 12:32 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Yes
02/11/23, 12:32 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Definitely true.
02/11/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
02/11/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/11/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
02/11/23, 12:37 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Yes please
02/11/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
02/11/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/11/23, 12:39 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Wow that's amazing
02/11/23, 12:39 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Following and understanding
02/11/23, 12:40 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their MSCE result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final MSCE results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
02/11/23, 12:43 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Understood
02/11/23, 12:44 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 12:45 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: So far we have done. 

Personalised counseling session stage.
02/11/23, 12:46 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
02/11/23, 12:47 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Sure, go ahead.
02/11/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
02/11/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
02/11/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
02/11/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
02/11/23, 12:50 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Yes understood.
02/11/23, 3:09 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

04/11/23, 11:20 am - Austin#276: Good to hear from you, Brave!
04/11/23, 11:20 am - Austin#276: Have you completed the discussions within your family regarding the Edoofa program?
04/11/23, 11:20 am - +265 992 77 80 23: Let's continue yes
04/11/23, 11:26 am - Austin#276: Great, So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
04/11/23, 11:29 am - +265 992 77 80 23: Well they followed up with it. Understood everything. 

Shared about the whole earn while you learn program. 

They liked that yes, 

They didn't say much rather gave me a go ahead.  

So you may start.
04/11/23, 11:33 am - Austin#276: I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career. So may I know if your family has any queries, please
04/11/23, 11:33 am - +265 992 77 80 23: No, not at the moment maybe as we go forward with the sessions they will offer there queries
04/11/23, 11:38 am - Austin#276: Noted Brave!
04/11/23, 11:38 am - Austin#276: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
04/11/23, 11:59 am - +265 992 77 80 23: Through the edoofa program I will be studying Bacholor in computer application.

The country of education is India.


The average cost for study in the country without a scholarship  is 6000$-8000$ per year.

If found eligible for the program I will be paying 2000$-3000$ per annum.

The enrolment fee for edoofa programs is 350$ and it is paid within 7 days and if having difficulties to pay on time parents are provided with a chance to pay 200$ then pay the remaing 150$ withn the next 30 days. 


Now, the "EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM" is an opportunity that provides eligible students with the chance of lowering down there tuition fees simply by earning credits after completion of tasks. 

This program however is important as it provides students with the knowledge of work and responsibility as well. 

Apart from that, the earn while you learn program doesn't have limits on how much you can earn with it. In some instances, it's possible to earn credits enough to be added to your tuition fee. 

This however reduces parents responsibility in expenditures. 



Yes I am clear about the payment after receiving an offer letter from the university. <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 12:28 pm - Austin#276: Good Work, Brave!

08/11/23, 2:15 pm - +265 888 95 04 55: Am ok a little bit busier but am following please
08/11/23, 2:17 pm - Arshita: Greetings! 

I can understand that!
08/11/23, 2:17 pm - Arshita: Did you manage to go through the letter and do you have any questions?
08/11/23, 2:17 pm - +265 888 95 04 55: Thank you but go ahead am following each and every message
08/11/23, 2:19 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: I have a question yes.

So per the scholarship that I have been awarded, can you explain properly how the 60-100% works.
08/11/23, 2:19 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Because the letter says its between 60-100
08/11/23, 2:20 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: So I want to have an ideal understanding of how much it is that will be required of my parents to offer as my tuition fees and etcm
08/11/23, 2:20 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Etc*
08/11/23, 2:20 pm - Arshita: The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment. The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

The final percentage will be mentioned in the Offer Letter from the University
08/11/23, 2:21 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Alright now I understand very well.
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Second question, Will the earn while you learn program commence right away when my parents pay the 350$?
08/11/23, 2:23 pm - Arshita: Yes Brave, once you are enrolled, you will be connected with your admissions officer and EWYL mentor who will begin your journey ahead.
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Alright understood now. 

Third question, about the visa process. In our sessions you talked about a visa team that handles such, so I want to know how goes it, does it incur extra charges to process a visa or everything is billed at the expense of the first payment of the tuition fees ?
08/11/23, 2:37 pm - Arshita: Please note that after your university registration process our admissions team will be guiding you about the visa process by simplifying it for you. 

There is an application fee of $83 to be paid at the embassy by your family. 

It usually takes 7-15 days for the processing of visa.
08/11/23, 2:38 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Alright thank you. Understood now.
08/11/23, 2:39 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Another question, is it possible to earn the whole entire tuition fees through EWYL
08/11/23, 2:47 pm - Arshita: It would take a lot of efforts to earn the complete fee through EWYL program which is the reason we encourage parents to chip in and help students with the fee after the edoofa program. 

But there are students who are currently catering their entire fee. Let me show you an example
08/11/23, 2:48 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 2:49 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Thank you this is the motivation I needed.
08/11/23, 2:50 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: When is a student supposed to arrive in India because the letter said something about August, is August 2024 the month of intake and departure to India for school?
08/11/23, 3:05 pm - Arshita: Yes Brave, you are right
08/11/23, 3:05 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Alright thank you. Understood
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: No further questions
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: For now
08/11/23, 3:09 pm - Arshita: Did you manage to connect to any of our beneficiaries or their parents from your country to learn their experiences through the Edoofa Scholarship program?
08/11/23, 3:10 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: I didn't but I will try again today to learn from them more about the scholarship program.
08/11/23, 3:13 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: I was more focused on the program session but I will try to connect with them. Their contacts are saved in my phone
08/11/23, 3:16 pm - Arshita: I understand, so which all Edoofians are you familiar with?
08/11/23, 3:21 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: I have  a friend who also enrolled for the same a year ago I believe, I will inquire from him as well.
08/11/23, 3:23 pm - Arshita: May I know about his name?
08/11/23, 3:24 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Has to be precious phiri
08/11/23, 3:25 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: I will also inquire from the contacts you sent in our early sessions
08/11/23, 3:25 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: When I have questions.
08/11/23, 3:28 pm - Arshita: That is great to know as Precious is one of our students who is currently here in India and a former student of Maranda Secondary school Malawi

08/11/23, 3:48 pm - Arshita: As you know higher education is a big decision that has to be taken through discussions with both students and families. 

So shall I schedule a video call for your parents/parent with the Program Director at Edoofa to discuss your application, performance and further procedures?
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - +265 992 77 80 23: Can the video call be rescheduled for tommorow  because both of my parents are extremely busy at the moment.
