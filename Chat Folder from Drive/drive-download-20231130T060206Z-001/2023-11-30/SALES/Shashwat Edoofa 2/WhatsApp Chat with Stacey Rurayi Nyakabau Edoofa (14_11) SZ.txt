18/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 242 8203: No. 

Kindly note that I am a guardian to Stacey and I basically want to understand what Edoofa is all about and how it can assist a young student aspiring to get to University and the sponsorship programs/structures in place. 

Also the university study courses that it provides sponsorship support to
18/11/23, 11:26 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
18/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 242 8203: Thanks for the clarification. 

In this case what you actually offer is an international scholarship for studies in India, am I right?

20/11/23, 11:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! Well, before we move ahead with your course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind studying abroad. Also please share pictures of your previous qualifications results for evaluation. Moreover, please mention the year of completion of A level as well?
20/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 999 2252: I have not completed my A level yet.
20/11/23, 1:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge the other questions as well?
20/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 999 2252: I believe there is not a more exciting privilege for a student to be able to discover new academic systems from new places.Studying abroad is the opportunity to discover oneself while gaining an understanding of a different culture.I believe that it enhances students self-awareness and understanding in their own culture by providing opportunities to compare and contrast host country customs, values, traditions with their own.In the process students get to meet new people with different backgrounds that are entirely different from their own and they learn to adapt to different situations.Getting to experience all of the above is what motivates me and is why I would like to study abroad.
20/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 242 8203: 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 that's brilliant, we support you all the way!
20/11/23, 7:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is truly commendable, Mr. Charles!
20/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Stacey! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
