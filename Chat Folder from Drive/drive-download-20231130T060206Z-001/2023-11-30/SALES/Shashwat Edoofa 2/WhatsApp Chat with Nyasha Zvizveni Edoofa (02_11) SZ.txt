08/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 008 6541: Greetings Nyasha,

With utmost pleasure we wish to inform you that you were found satisfactorily conforming to the academic scrutiny of the admission panel for Bachelor of Social work. In lieu of the same, please find attached your offer letter from Parul University for the AY 2024-25.

Please Note - Tuition fees is $1900 per academic year. This letter is not a confirmation of admission. It is simply a document stating the provisions and conditions of your admission to the University. To complete your registration you need to furnish a one-time registration fees of $100usd and an enrolment fee of $50 as prescribed by the University. For the same, your admission officer would extend help or you can visit one of our offices.

Please reach out to us for any further query/concern.
08/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 008 6541: You have at least 15 to 30 days to pay for the registration and enrolment fees to confirm your  admission from the day you receiveyour offer letter. The $100 confirms admission and is part of your tuition fees.If your fees is $1900 a year it means you  will have a balance of $1800. From then on you can make payment plans for the rest of the payments.  Take note that to obtain your final admission letter you have to have paid at least $1000 tuition fees and your accommodation fees. Also note that the final admission letter is a requirement for the Indian embassy to grant you a student Visa.

08/11/23, 3:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nyasha. May I know who sent you this, please?
08/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 008 6541: Study partners group ....the platform i used  to apply for Social work
08/11/23, 3:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nyasha. I would like to inform you that we are not associated with Parul University!
08/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 008 6541: oooh um sorry
08/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 008 6541: but u from India ryt
08/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Nyasha.
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Nyasha. It's important to note that Parul University does not possess global recognition. Consequently, the degree you earn from this institution will not be internationally recognized, potentially rendering your investment of time and money to yield no outcome. As your concierge, my primary goal is to provide you with accurate guidance. It's reassuring to note that Edoofa is a government-recognized organization with a strong global reputation for delivering high-quality education. This highlights one of the key factors contributing to the preference of multinational corporations to hire graduates from other institutions, ultimately leading to a comparatively lower placement rate for Parul University. Furthermore, I'm pleased to inform you that Edoofa has received recognition from the First Lady of Zimbabwe. We have worked with over 250 globally renowned and internationally accredited universities. In my capacity as your counselor, I kindly advise against enrolling in an institution that may not offer the same level of recognition and value.
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In these large number of applications I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's a recommendation that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Since I did not receive a response, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However *please Note by Monday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply*  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
