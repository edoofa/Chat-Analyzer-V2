24/11/23, 11:26 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the above information, be transparent and active throughout the counseling session and Evaluation
 
So shall we start the session?
24/11/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 298 9303: Yes please.
24/11/23, 11:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your son ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
24/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 298 9303: I am a Social worker by profession. With a Bsc in Social Work and a Masters in International Relations. 
I have 2 children with Tafara being the youngest. My husband is an Electrical engineer
I believe that the right and quality education positions any child as competitive in future. Professional competence is founded upon a strong educational foundation. Hence my motivation to support my son ahead for education and for any cutting edge opportunities in further education.
24/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 298 9303: My son is a promising student. Very focused, determined and hard working. He has always been driven by motivation and ambition. 
I have observed that he does not back up from a challenge, he is innovative and strong willed. I have also observed that he hates confrontation and if he feels like someone is being confrontational he either tells them what they want to hear or completely ignore. I have also observed that he performs better under pressure, like when things have tight deadlines he pushes through and this then leads to this noticeable weakness of maybe relaxing if deadlines are relaxed. 
As a person my son is very caring, looks out for his sister, parents, cousins and anyone whom he holds dear. Most importantly I have noticed since he was in primary, he respects school protocols and does not want to be involved in things that could land him in trouble with teachers and authority. It is very rare to find a boy who wouldn't want to smuggle tinned foods or noodles as part of his school tuck, but Tafara has always been like that, if it's not allowed then he won't carry it to school. As he became a teenager I have always been on the look out for peer driven deviance, but Tafara is yet to dissapoint me. I know right now I am speaking as his mother and I am a proud one for that matter.
24/11/23, 1:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: As a dedicated social worker with a BSc in Social Work and a Masters in International Relations, your commitment to making a positive impact on society is truly commendable. Juggling a successful career with raising two children, Tafara being the youngest, showcases your exceptional ability to balance multiple responsibilities. Mr. Admire's role as an Electrical Engineer adds a dynamic perspective to your family. What stands out is your unwavering belief in the transformative power of quality education, underscoring your forward-thinking approach. Your journey as a social worker, mother, and partner reflects a harmonious blend of professional accomplishment and personal fulfillment, making you a positive force shaping the future, Mrs. Charity!
24/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. Tafara is a beacon of promise, showcasing exceptional qualities of focus, determination, and hard work. His innovative spirit, coupled with a caring nature and unwavering respect for authority, makes him not only an outstanding student but also a source of pride for discerning and proud parents! I have confidence that Tafara is an exceptionally diligent student, and he will undoubtedly demonstrate his capabilities if given the right guidance!
24/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Thank you
24/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 298 9303: You have said it so well. Thank you
24/11/23, 2:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed light on the educational background of Tafara's sibling?
24/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 298 9303: His sister went up to Advanced Level. When she was about to go to college for a marketing course Covid happened and everything was disrupted. So instead she got employment as a marketing person in the industry of farming implements and spares. She went on to get a class 2 driver's license and now she is working towards a marketing HND
24/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 298 9303: What does this offer entail.? What's in the package
24/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for being articulate, Mrs. Charity! Your co-operation is highly appreciated!
24/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please elaborate your query?
24/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Can you please give more details about the scholarship program. What is in it for the student, which universities, which programs does it support, for how long??? Any detail so that we get to the same wavelength
24/11/23, 3:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. May I know whether you are connected with Abigail's parents, please?
24/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 298 9303: What's Abigail's full name
24/11/23, 3:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. Abigail's full name is *Abigail Bidi* and she is currently studying with us in India, please.
24/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 298 9303: It's my first time hearing about her name. However I have heard from community connections that there is a program for Zimbabwean children in India. And I know a parent whose child went to India this year. But I do not know the Bidi family

28/11/23, 10:57 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through these messages, please.
28/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 298 9303: I have been going through the messages yes, but still have questions like;
 
Is Edoofa a scholarship program or an institution like a college or university? 
What courses does Edoofa offer support for?
28/11/23, 11:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I appreciate your thoughtful inquiry, Mrs. Charity. I will do my utmost to provide you with a comprehensive explanation. In essence, *Edoofa* is a distinguished scholarship program, offering 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees to every deserving student. Regarding the selection of colleges or universities, it's important to emphasize that Edoofa is a scholarship program. We have worked with over 250 globally renowned and internationally accredited universities. Concerning the inquiry about courses, there is a wide array of courses, exceeding 3500 in number, which makes it impractical to provide an exhaustive description of each. However, the primary objective of this counseling session is to identify and recommend a course that aligns perfectly with the student's unique career aspirations and goals!
28/11/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 298 9303: Alright. I get it
28/11/23, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have a clear understanding of the program, Mrs. Charity?
28/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 298 9303: Maybe not a clear understanding but enough understanding to continue the conversation. Does the Edoofa website say more like in terms of universities which one can choose from

28/11/23, 12:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, could you kindly tell me how much *Zimbabwe Republic Police High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education?
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 298 9303: We work towards the payment of the fees. However as our Local currency is not stable I am not sure what the figure is like now. I will only know when schools close and fees for 2024 are gazetted and announced
28/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Tafara's education abroad?
28/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Together as a family, mom and dad we will be supporting his education abroad as much as we can.
28/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Admire and Mrs. Charity. You are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to Tafara's well-being is truly admirable!

Tafara will be completing his A'level end of 2024. 
For a pic of his Level results I will send it tomorrow when I collect it from school were they have it in their files
29/11/23, 2:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mrs. Charity! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!

29/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 298 9303: He still needs more guidance. His preferences are still very much changing and understandably so at his age. However I have picked that he aspires for environmentally based careers, with interface with geography, flora and fauna
29/11/23, 4:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates Tafara the most and the origins of his interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited his fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
29/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 298 9303: Can I respond tomorrow after I sit down with him and have a discussion?
