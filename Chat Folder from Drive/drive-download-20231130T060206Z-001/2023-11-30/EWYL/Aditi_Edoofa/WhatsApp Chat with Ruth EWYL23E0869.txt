20/11/23, 8:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
20/11/23, 8:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Ruth, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
20/11/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: I've noticed that you've left my message on "Seen" without responding.
Your responsibility as a mentee includes actively engaging in conversations, seeking guidance when needed, and keeping me updated on your progress. Ignoring messages, even unintentionally, can hinder our ability to work together effectively and achieve your goals.

If you're facing challenges or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Our communication should be a two-way street, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
20/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 616 4869: Okay..im sorry im trying to balance my studies with this, this week is examination week, so I'm doing thorough revision
20/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: I understand, Ruth, but I believe it's feasible for you to allocate an hour of your undivided attention for this session, right?
20/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 616 4869: My long term goals are to get a good degree ..get a good job so that I can provide for myself and my family too. As for the EWYL program, it will help me gain exposure in terms of knowing how to be employable
20/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 616 4869: Yes yes that is true
20/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 616 4869: Is 1200hrs okay
20/11/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your long-term goals of obtaining a good degree and securing a fulfilling job to provide for yourself and your family are certainly admirable, Blessing. It's evident that you have a strong sense of responsibility and a clear vision for your future.
20/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 616 4869: Thank you
20/11/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Ruth, I am afraid the timings you have suggested doesn't align with my schedule, so I would appreciate it if we could stick to this schedule.
20/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 616 4869: Okay
20/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 616 4869: Noo not really
20/11/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/11/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 616 4869: Got it
20/11/23, 9:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/11/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 616 4869: Okay 👍
20/11/23, 9:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/11/23, 9:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, this is it for today's session, we will meet tomorrow with renewed enthusiasm.🤩

21/11/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
21/11/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

24/11/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
24/11/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
24/11/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

24/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 616 4869: I am not a form 6 student though. The ones I know who I am in touch with.. most of them are now part of Edoofa and the rest hve already started their tetiary education elsewhere

24/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 616 4869: Ok .. I'll see if I can get in contact with some today
24/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
24/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
24/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

28/11/23, 6:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.

May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
28/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 616 4869: I don't have other school Heads contacts
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 78 616 4869: Apparently my former school now has a new head master

28/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 616 4869: Ok
28/11/23, 6:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
28/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 616 4869: So if I find a head master's contact, I will have to put the contact in this group
28/11/23, 6:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: No Ruth, you have to reach out to him on your own and convince him.
28/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 616 4869: Ooh okay
28/11/23, 6:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

29/11/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

29/11/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

29/11/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
