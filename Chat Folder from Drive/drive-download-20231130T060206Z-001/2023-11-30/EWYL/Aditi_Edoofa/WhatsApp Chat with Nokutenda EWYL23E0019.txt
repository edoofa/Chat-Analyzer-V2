16/09/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Nokutenda.!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 12:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 670 3539: My sincere apologies.  Due to circumstances here at home I have decided to withdraw from this program. It was not my wish to waste your time but there are things out of my control. I hope you understand.
19/09/23, 1:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.
19/09/23, 1:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Nokutenda, can you please tell me the reason for withdrawing yourself if you are facing any challenges, then you can share it with me I am here as a mentor to help you out.
19/09/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 670 3539: There aren't any challenges.  I've decided not to peruse India and also I am taking a gap year
20/09/23, 8:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.
20/09/23, 8:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know how you came up with this decision, any specific reason behind it?

I trust all is going smoothly for you. I wanted to discuss Nokutenda—how is she, and has the personal issues been resolved regarding her education's matter?
