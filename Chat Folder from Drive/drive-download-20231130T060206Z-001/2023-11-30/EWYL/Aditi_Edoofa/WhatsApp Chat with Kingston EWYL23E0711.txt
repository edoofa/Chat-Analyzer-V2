I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
03/10/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Kingston,, I'm deeply disappointed that you missed our scheduled session today without any prior notice. I trust that you recognize the importance of these sessions and the necessity of maintaining regular attendance.
03/10/23, 10:33 am - +265 981 27 65 43: Hello Ms. Aditi
03/10/23, 10:34 am - +265 981 27 65 43: I am sorry for not letting you know the reason behind my absence.
03/10/23, 10:55 am - +265 981 27 65 43: I asked some questions to my admission supervisor and am waiting for his replies.
03/10/23, 12:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, may I know the context of your queries from the admissions team.
03/10/23, 12:42 pm - +265 981 27 65 43: My uncle, brother and I requested the admissions team to give us a summary of all the costs that we are expected to pay throughout this process.
03/10/23, 1:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, Kingston.
I am sure the Admissions team will get back to you as soon as possible.
03/10/23, 4:11 pm - +265 981 27 65 43: And am hoping for the same and I requested not to progress any further until we are through with the matter. <This message was edited>
04/10/23, 8:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Kingston!
How are you?
04/10/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: This issue can be addressed with the admissions team, or else you'll miss out on the EWYL journey and I hope you are aware of the importance of the EWYL Journey.
04/10/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Kingston, as your mentor, I would like to understand your challenges with the Admissions team. It's important to note that both of these departments operate autonomously, and if you encounter an issue with one, it shouldn't hinder the progress of the other.
Also, I can assure you that your admissions team is fully competent to resolve your issue regarding that so I would suggest you not to worry about that and continue with your journey so that you do not miss out on any opportunity.
04/10/23, 9:18 am - +265 981 27 65 43: I really understand all that but what if after evaluating the costs my family finds out that we can't afford the amount to be paid here in Malawi?
04/10/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Kingston, I truly understand your perspective, and I agree with it. Rest assured, the admissions team will make contact with you soon.

I want to emphasize on the motivating aspect of the EWYL program; it is custom-tailored to empower you in achieving a self-financed education, significantly lightening the financial load on your family. This means you'll have the opportunity to study here in India at an incredibly affordable cost, which should serve as an exciting prospect for your educational journey.
04/10/23, 9:42 am - +265 981 27 65 43: Before I reach India, there are some costs that I am supposed to pay here in Malawi and I have to process everything concerning my travel  documents and my transport fare. Looking at these costs my family thinks that it wont be capable covering all these because my uncle is not only helping me but also some other 4 individuals.
04/10/23, 9:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: I completely understand the financial challenges you're facing in Malawi. It's not uncommon for the preparations and costs involved in traveling to India to be a substantial burden. It's essential to discuss your situation with your family and your admissions team.
04/10/23, 9:45 am - +265 981 27 65 43: That's the reason we have been waiting for their response patiently.
11/10/23, 8:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Kingston!
How are you today?
11/10/23, 8:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: I hope that your issue is resolved now with the Admissions Team.
11/10/23, 8:57 am - +265 981 27 65 43: I am fine sir and how are you?
11/10/23, 8:58 am - +265 981 27 65 43: We are still discussing on the same.
11/10/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am well, though I would like to mention that I am a female, so I would appreciate it if you would address me as ma'am.
11/10/23, 9:08 am - +265 981 27 65 43: Sorry for that ma'am, just that I have been interacting with men throughout this process so I was kind of used.
11/10/23, 9:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright, Kingston.
11/10/23, 9:09 am - +265 981 27 65 43: Thank you for the understanding ma'am.
11/10/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: I'd like to understand your thoughts on this matter and your plans for the future. What have you envisioned, and what are your aspirations in this regarding studying in India?
11/10/23, 9:37 am - +265 981 27 65 43: Studying in India is a good opportunity that I would never wish to miss because it is a step in fulfilling my goals though momentarily it seems impossible due to some financial turbulences in our family.
11/10/23, 9:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: Kingston, if you're comfortable discussing it, could you please share what happrened regarding your financial situation all of a sudden?
11/10/23, 9:47 am - +265 981 27 65 43: I hope you know that I rely on my uncle for financial support.
11/10/23, 9:58 am - +265 981 27 65 43: Now, the situation is that I am not the only one relying on him. There are other four relatives who are supported by him financially in their education. This has created pressure on the uncle since those relatives didn't get any loan from the government. On the other hand, I was selected in one of the best universities here in Malawi and I qualified for government loan. It is quite obvious that my other relatives need much help than I do. <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 1:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I completely understand the situation and the importance of supporting your other relatives. However, pursuing your education in India can offer unique opportunities for you to grow academically and personally. It might also open doors for you to contribute financially to your family in the long run.  It's an opportunity for you to not only focus on your education but also explore how you might contribute to your family's well-being. This way, you can strike a balance between your academic pursuits and your family's needs.. Let's discuss how we can make this a win-win situation for everyone.
11/10/23, 2:15 pm - +265 981 27 65 43: Let's put time into consideration. It's true that after my education I can make it by having a good job or having many unseen opportunities. That is supposed to be 5 years from now. You mean these other people are supposed to wait for 5 years without schooling just for me to go to study in India?
11/10/23, 2:21 pm - +265 981 27 65 43: I know that studying in India is a good opportunity but I don't think it's a good choice doing that using limited money. One is supposed to have enough financial support which I don't have. What else can I do ma'am?
29/11/23, 10:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @265888657440 
How are you?

I trust all is going smoothly for you. I wanted to discuss Kingston—how is he, and has the financial constraint been resolved regarding his education's matter?
29/11/23, 12:54 pm - +265 888 65 74 40: Yea am doing well and King is also doing fine only that he lost his phone
29/11/23, 12:54 pm - +265 888 65 74 40: Mine 09.vcf (file attached)
29/11/23, 12:56 pm - +265 888 65 74 40: One the issue concerning finances would you talk to Uncle he can be on a good position to respond on that since he is the main source of King's sponsor on education
