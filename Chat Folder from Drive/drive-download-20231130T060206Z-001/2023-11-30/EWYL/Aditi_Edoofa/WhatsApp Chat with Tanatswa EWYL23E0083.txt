16/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Tanatswa!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 10:24 am - +263 78 902 9727: Good morning
We will take the second option <This message was edited>
16/09/23, 10:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, you would be opting for a session on Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.?
16/09/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 902 9727: Yes
16/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 288 6038: Well she will take the second option.
16/09/23, 12:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, thank you.
Have a good day.
25/09/23, 10:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

I apologize for being unable to take your Saturday session because the organization was closed. Your understanding is greatly appreciated.
30/09/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
30/09/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 902 9727: Good morning, we are having connectivity issues
30/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 902 9727: So I will face a lot of challenges with consistency throughout the session 
My sincere apologies
30/09/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand but let's do our best to work through the connection problems and make the most of our time together.
30/09/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Tanatswa! I'm thrilled to catch up with you and get all the details about your current project progress and the amazing ways you've been upskilling yourself. So, let's dive right in and share the incredible journey you've been on!
30/09/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 902 9727: I am also very excited to get in touch again but as my parents and I have mentioned earlier, we had put the EWYL program on hold because of school and we informed the EDOOFA family via email
30/09/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 902 9727: So I haven't started the ewyl projects
30/09/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I get it. I was of the notion it was Tanatswa's phone number.
30/09/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Tanatswa* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
30/09/23, 9:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
