It's Melisa ,, I'll be going to school everyday from 0700 to 1500 so if I can proceed with my EWYL journey from 1500 everyday it will be great but if yu are not comfortable with the time we will have to switch to November 
Thank you
16/08/23, 1:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
16/08/23, 1:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hope you are well.
16/08/23, 1:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: These timings do not align with my schedule.
I want Melisa you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
16/08/23, 1:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and aditii.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com
16/08/23, 1:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Once done, please let me know.
16/08/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 274 4412: Thanks for asking we are fine and you I will pass your message when she comes from extra lessons anytime after 18:00
16/08/23, 3:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay that would be appreciated.
16/08/23, 3:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you.

16/09/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Melisa!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 10:37 am - +263 71 813 7664: Good morning sir 
I'll take option 2
16/09/23, 10:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, you would be opting for a session on Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.?
16/09/23, 10:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: Also I would like to mention that I am a female so I would appreciate it if you would address me as Ms. Aditi or ma'am.
16/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 813 7664: Sir Shivjeet has been helping me with my admissions from 0730 pm to 1030 pm
16/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 813 7664: This message was deleted
16/09/23, 10:43 am - +263 71 813 7664: Sorry ma'am
16/09/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 813 7664: Yes ma'am
16/09/23, 10:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
16/09/23, 10:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you and have a good day!
16/09/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 813 7664: Okay same to yu
25/09/23, 10:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

I apologize for being unable to take your Saturday session because the organization was closed. Your understanding is greatly appreciated.
30/09/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
30/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 813 7664: Good morning mam 
Yes we can start bt the network is very bad this side
30/09/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand but let's do our best to work through the connection problems and make the most of our time together.
30/09/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 813 7664: Okay mam we can proceed
30/09/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Melisa! I'm thrilled to catch up with you and get all the details about your current project progress and the amazing ways you've been upskilling yourself. So, let's dive right in and share the incredible journey you've been on!
30/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 813 7664: I've been through some counselling with Mr  Shivjeet but he seems so busy these days so we rarely have our sessions ,,The program that I'll be focusing on is Cardiovascular technology ,, I working very hard to attain the number of points that will support my dream
30/09/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: It sounds like you've been working diligently toward your goal in Cardiovascular technology. It's understandable that scheduling conflicts can be frustrating when it comes to counseling sessions.
30/09/23, 9:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Melisa, may I know about your EWYL Journey progress as well.
30/09/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 813 7664: I didn't start with EWYL journey i was suppose to start in May but i was going to school so i postponed it
30/09/23, 9:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, understood.
30/09/23, 9:58 am - Aditi Edoofa: So we will begin with that and make sure that you don't stay behind your peers.
30/09/23, 9:58 am - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, you would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as you can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that you will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same. <This message was edited>

I trust you're doing well.

I'm currently in a crucial meeting and need to reschedule our session for 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM.
Thank you for understanding and reflect on the insights gained till now.
07/10/23, 11:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Melisa, I'm curious why you weren't able to make it to the rescheduled session. Please treat this matter with importance and ensure that you are punctual for our sessions in the future. Your presence is valuable, and I would like to have you on time.
09/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Good afternoon noon mam 
We're starting to write our final exams next week on Tuesday so I have a lot of school work to attend to that is why i missed my session I was at school
09/10/23, 3:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I completely understand that your final exams are approaching, and your schoolwork is a priority. It's important to focus on your studies during this time but you should have informed and I hope that one Saturday you can take out 1 hour for your EWYL Sessions.
09/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Yeah sure 
I'll be available for the session

29/11/23, 1:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Melisa @263718137664 @263772744412 

I hope this message finds you well. As *Melisa's exams are presumably completed*, I would like to discuss when she plans to return and *resume our EWYL sessions.* Her progress is important, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work together.

Please let me know her availability.
29/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Good afternoon mam 
I'll be available anytime although sometimes our network connection will be very bad that it will be very hard to connect with you
