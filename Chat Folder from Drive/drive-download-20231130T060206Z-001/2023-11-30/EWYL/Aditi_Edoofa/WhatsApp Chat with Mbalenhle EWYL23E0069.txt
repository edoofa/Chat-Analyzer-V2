10/08/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
10/08/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
10/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 329 9525: That's lovely thank you a lot ma'am
10/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!

14/08/23, 8:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
14/08/23, 8:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
14/08/23, 8:39 am - +263 78 329 9525: Thank you ma'am I'm following
14/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 329 9525: Ma'am may I ask the group I created is based on what??Or you are going to inform me as time goes on?
14/08/23, 8:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so basically the group would have participants who are interested in pursuing their graduation, masters or PhD from India or who can be interested like students appearing for their A level exams.
14/08/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: And after that in the group, your task is to build a network through your communication skills and with the help of the resources shared, try to get the student's attention and get the form filled out by them and then share the form in the group with me.
14/08/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 329 9525: Okay I get it thank you ma'am..Is it worth for me to start adding them right now?
14/08/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, it is the sooner you start the more students you can reach out and get good amount of forms and earn credits on them.
14/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 329 9525: Okay okay I didn't know but anyways I'm starting right now thank you so much
14/08/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay Great
14/08/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now comes the interesting part where you will be rewarded with scholarship credits for networking with your connection. 
After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you have explained to the student as we have discussed right?
14/08/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 329 9525: Yes yes I did ma'am and I'm about to finish inducting one of my colleague here who's interested
14/08/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: That is superb!
14/08/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
14/08/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 
Also, I am pleased to inform you that tomorrow i.e. 15th August 2023 marks the 77th Independence day of India. Please note that in light of this special occasion, there will be no session held tomorrow, August 15th.

With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
17/08/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
17/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 329 9525: Yes ma'am indeed I'm promising

17/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 329 9525: Yes ma'am
17/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
17/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 329 9525: Okay ma'am great....I'm on the track

17/08/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey.

17/08/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
17/08/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 329 9525: The first question I have is...Should I first start with the Head or principal of my own school?

28/08/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Tuesday and Friday from 12:00 PM - 1:30 PM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
28/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 329 9525: I'm starting from tommorow isn't ?
28/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 329 9525: Since it's Tuesday
28/08/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you would be.
28/08/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?
28/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 329 9525: No I don't have any of the ideas ma'am
28/08/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay I will help you with that.
28/08/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
28/08/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
28/08/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
28/08/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
28/08/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 329 9525: Okay ma'am I'm following and I'm getting you right
28/08/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
28/08/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: -There is no deadline for the project.
-There is no order in which you have to do the project.
-There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
-There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.
Moreover, it is important that you make steady progress every day.
28/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 329 9525: True that thank you ma'am....
28/08/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, this is it from my side for your sessions here in the group, now we will be connecting on the EWYL Line.
Make sure you follow all the rules and be regular and active in your sessions to have a fruitful EWYL Journey and earn credits to self finance your higher education.
28/08/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 329 9525: Noted ma'am I'm following
