22/08/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.

22/08/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Prince, we will resume our session tomorrow onwards from *2:00 PM to 3:00 PM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 2:00, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey
22/08/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Have a good day.

Doing tasks in the EWYL program will teach me to be practical such that as a long-term goal l will have some practical experience from there on and later on in time.

Thank you.

23/08/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.

Please excuse me for the delay in the session as I was caught up in a meeting.
So now are you ready for your session.
23/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 444 1698: It's okay ma'am. l am ready for the session.
23/08/23, 2:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I am impressed to know about your long-term goals Prince.
23/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 444 1698: Thank you so much.
23/08/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 444 1698: l think to make higher education available for all and to to teach Edoofians working skills.
23/08/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/08/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 444 1698: Objectives noted Ms Aditi.
23/08/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
23/08/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
23/08/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 444 1698: Thank you, that is so great this Edoofian.
23/08/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know which part you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell. <This message was edited>
23/08/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 444 1698: His gratitude towards Edoofa and its EWYL program. Also the redeem part he appreciated.
23/08/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: - Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.

Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
23/08/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 444 1698: Thank you.

23/08/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great.
23/08/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know on
ce you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

29/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 444 1698: l will be looking for potential companies that will join hands with Edoofa in developing enrollment of students into the Edoofa Program. The nature of the companies to be chosen is either student-centric, recreational and content centric platforms. l should consider a company scale of people between 50-200 and the company should be financially stable. Platforms like Google and LinkedIn will ne used in approaching these companies. For example on LinkedIn l will collect information of the company from different categories such as LinkedIn tabs where l will visit its about  and its people. Another important thing is to study the website of the company checking its functionality. This will help in getting an idea about the companies activities. l should also understand the background of the company founder. The final stage is to to give an invitation preferably to the heads of the department like Managers. Thank you.
31/08/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 444 1698: Good afternoon Ms Aditi.

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024
01/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 444 1698: Thank you Ms Aditi.
01/09/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
01/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 444 1698: l am following ma'am.
01/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
01/09/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
01/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 444 1698: Yes that will help a lot.
01/09/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*PRINCE/ADITI/1SEPT23*
01/09/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
01/09/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Thank you.
08/09/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
08/09/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
08/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 444 1698: l don't have the Contact and he's always busy out of school.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
08/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 444 1698: Ok ma'am l will get the skill. So is it such that l will be forwarding the messages you sent me to him and vice versa?

I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
11/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 444 1698: Good afternoon Ms Aditi. l am ready.
11/09/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
11/09/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So resuming your journey from here.
11/09/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
11/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 444 1698: Honestly speaking l can't do the projects as required because l am facing my Final A Level examinations starting from 18 September so l am very busy and behind time.
11/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand Prince.
11/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
11/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.

11/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Once done, please let me know.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
