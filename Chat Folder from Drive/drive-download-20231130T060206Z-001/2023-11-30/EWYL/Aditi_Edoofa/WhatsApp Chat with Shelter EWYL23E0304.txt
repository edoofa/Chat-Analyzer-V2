It gives them an opportunity toake the details proud by telling them how lucky they are  to qualify in the Edoofa programme. One will have to reach out to local schools and headmasters in his /her region and inform them about Edoofa programme. To make it easy one has to make a list of schools in local areas. Also connecting with one's previous school. Reach out to the headmaster and tell him about Edoofa and why he /she joined Edoofa programme. After that one has to ask if they want an online meeting with the Edoofa programme director
10/08/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Shelter. However I’ll explain this project quickly for you in 2 steps:  I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?

14/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 543 9416: Alright ma'am

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
14/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 543 9416: 1.St Mary Magdalene's High School. Not connected to Edoofa.
2. First introduce myself as their former student. After that, I introduce to them the scholarship that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education. 
3. Manicaland
14/08/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.

May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
14/08/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 543 9416: Alright I will ask for the Head's contact. There is a new Head now of which I'm not so familiar with him.
14/08/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay that would be great!
14/08/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: When you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
14/08/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

14/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Perfect!
14/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me share some important resources with you that you can share with the School Head.
14/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*.

Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!
14/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over *100 schools in Africa*, and over *3000 African students* are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.🙌
14/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: _Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._
14/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.
14/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: The Child of the *DEO, Manicaland* Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
_*United College of Education*_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 


Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, _*Headmaster of Chibuwe High*_, the son of Ms. Christina Rockson, _The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School_, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, _DEO at Masvingo province_ are Edoofians and they have many more success stories from _St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High_, etc.
14/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
14/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 543 9416: Alright thank you ma'am
14/08/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: Also, When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
14/08/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 543 9416: Alright well noted
14/08/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 
Also, I am pleased to inform you that tomorrow i.e. 15th August 2023 marks the 77th Independence day of India.

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
17/08/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 543 9416: OK ma'am 😊I will do so
17/08/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.

Let’s begin with today's session.
22/08/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 543 9416: Good morning ma'am
22/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 543 9416: I was very punctual today but the message could not send because of poor network connection but we can now proceed with the session
22/08/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
22/08/23, 8:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: So resuming from here.
22/08/23, 8:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
22/08/23, 8:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
22/08/23, 8:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
22/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 543 9416: Alright ma'am well noted
22/08/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
22/08/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
22/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 543 9416: OK ma'am well noted
22/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 543 9416: So today should I send a message in the group or I will do it on Thursday?
22/08/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Today only Shelter as you have to follow the ritual daily irrespective of the fact that if you have a session on that day or not.
22/08/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 543 9416: Sorry I didn't understand can you make it clear
22/08/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: You have to do this everday even if you do not have a session on that day as this helps me to stay connected with you.
22/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 543 9416: Well understood thank you
22/08/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great.
22/08/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
22/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 543 9416: OK ma'am
22/08/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
22/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 543 9416: Alright well noted, thank you
22/08/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?
22/08/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 543 9416: No can you explain
22/08/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
22/08/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
22/08/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
22/08/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.

Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries <This message was edited>
22/08/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
22/08/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 543 9416: I'm following the messages thank you for explaining ma'am
22/08/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
22/08/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: -There is no deadline for the project.
-There is no order in which you have to do the project.
-There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
-There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
22/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 543 9416: Alright thank you
22/08/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, Shelter please do the needful.
22/08/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 543 9416: OK ma'am
22/08/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Also, this is it from my side for your sessions here in the group, now we will be connecting on the EWYL Line.
Make sure you follow all the rules and be regular and active in your sessions to have a fruitful EWYL Journey and earn credits to self finance your higher education.
22/08/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Have a good day!
22/08/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 543 9416: Thank you and same to you

20/10/23, 8:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here are the pointers for your help as discussed.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 12:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 4:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

We got all the details, audio and visual to prove her claims. Now that she's recovering, and has lots of workload that accumulated, I feel it televant to find a way (with her), on how she can cover up all the defecit so as to catch up. Thank you. Hopefully this note finds you well.
17/11/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @263712562989 
Hope you are well.

I understand balancing academic and EWYL commitments can be overwhelming, especially after going through such a challenging time. I appreciate your proactive stance in gathering all the necessary details.
I understand the importance of finding a way for Shelter to catch up on her workload. Let's schedule a meeting with her to discuss a manageable plan, considering her health and workload. Together, we can identify adjustments, prioritize tasks, and ensure she feels supported.

Your dedication to Shelter's well-being is commendable.

As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥
