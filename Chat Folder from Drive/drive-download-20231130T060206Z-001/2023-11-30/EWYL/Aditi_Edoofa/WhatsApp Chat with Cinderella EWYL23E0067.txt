So, I would like to tell you about newsletters we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know on
ce you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
10/08/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 270 4474: Discussed about the Earn while you learn whereby during the period will be doing projects that allows me to get money which will be used to reduce my learning expensive

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
11/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 966 1713: Good afternoon everyone. I'm Cinderella Gutsa and my mentor is Ms Aditi.  She set goals for my journey which I'm slightly going to elaborate on. To begin with I have a goal on academic greatness, which is my aim to always attain great results on my academics.  In addition I have to ensure that I have enough sustainable opportunities for self finance of higher education in India. Furthermore putting in mind that I'm entering the real world of workplace which is probably full of hardships I must have skills. Mr Angad Singh the founder of Edoofa interact with all students on newsletter. Coming to the Hall of Inspiration I believe that one isn't enough but many can make enough. Giving a hand in a society means helping yourself in other words. A better place of living is where the is journey and laughter in everyone's heart. Helping the old and the young is what makes everyone happy.
11/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 966 1713: * A better place of living is where there is joy and laughter

16/09/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Cinderella!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
29/11/23, 10:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Cinderella and Parents @263772704474 @263789661713 

I hope this message finds you well. As *Cinderella's exams are presumably completed*, I would like to discuss when you plan to return and *resume our EWYL sessions*. Her progress is important, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work together.
