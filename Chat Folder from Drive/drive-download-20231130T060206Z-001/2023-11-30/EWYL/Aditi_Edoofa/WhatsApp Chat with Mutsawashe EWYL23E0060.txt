16/09/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Mutsawashe!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 234 5238: Morning to you. I will have to check with Mutsawashe. Midweek is a bit of a challenge for me as we are not allowed phones during workdays.
16/09/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
Please check in with Mutsawashe and let me know as soon as possible.

07/10/23, 9:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, Mrs. B Mandinde, I trust that everything is going smoothly for you. I can imagine there must be quite a bit of pressure on your end too, especially with Mutsawashe currently in the midst of her exams.
07/10/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 227 4918: That is true. Mrs Mandinde is travelling out of town today as well. So she will not be reachable.

I hope this message finds you well. As *Mutsawashe's exams are presumably completed,* I would like to discuss when she plans to return and *resume our EWYL sessions.* Her progress is important, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work together.

Please let me know her availability. <This message was edited>

Can you share what you've retained till now from your EWYL Sessions so that we can resume from that point?
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 300 9465: I think I need a reminder
