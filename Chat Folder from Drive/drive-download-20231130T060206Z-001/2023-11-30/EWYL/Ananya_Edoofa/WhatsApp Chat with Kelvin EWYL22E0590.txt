03/08/23, 7:41 am - +91 78273 08969: Good morning, 

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in plans. Instead of having our session tomorrow, I will be conducting it today from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm. The reason for this change is that I'll be on leave tomorrow as my mother has come to town, and I'd like to spend some time with her.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to our session today.

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

Okay thank. Looking forward to a positive action.
16/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 522 4715: Okay noted, when will that session take place? 
Thank you so much. I would'nt have done it without your encouragement and guidance. Thank you.
16/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 522 4715: Thank you so much for the great opportunity. Feels great to see that my efforts were not put to waste
16/08/23, 3:25 pm - +91 78273 08969: Can we have our session now?
16/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 522 4715: Yes ma'am
16/08/23, 3:28 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 522 4715: Yes, I am ready
16/08/23, 3:30 pm - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 522 4715: Okay noted. This is great and feels good to have been found eligible for the Edoofa grant
16/08/23, 3:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 522 4715: No ma'am. Could you please enlighten me
16/08/23, 3:39 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 522 4715: That is great. Feel great that my efforts didn't go un noticed. Thank you for the motivation and encouragement
16/08/23, 3:42 pm - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 522 4715: Okay. Noted with thanks. I shall keep on pushing forward for better results.
16/08/23, 3:46 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 3:46 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>

17/08/23, 7:22 pm - +263 71 928 8293: Dear Ma'am Tenzin Tsomo 

I hope I find you and your team well, My family and I would like to acknowledge the call you made with Kelvin.  Yes Kelvin gave us an interesting update concerning the EWYL earnings the positive and interesting changes offered by the EDOOFA team so far it's  encouraging to learn that previously the student would earn $30 from the first  payment made by student introduced by Kelvin but the good news is that the earnings has been reviewed upwards to $50 And secondly if the the student makes a second payment for securing a place the earning is $100 and once the other payment is made the earning is $50 and when the final payment is made the earning will be another $100 therefore it means Kelvin will earn on each student introduced a total amount of $300.00.
We appreciate you so much for the work you are doing.  I am Kelvin"a Father

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Ananya your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Ananya's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

To begin our session today, I have a really interesting video that will make your life easier and more interesting! You are going to love it! 🚀

https://youtu.be/2HfhqzlqLHY?si=ZGBW5lB4gLN6h5Y9

01/11/23, 3:41 pm - +91 90416 75658: So as a person in the business field, i think this tool could be helpful lets say when I want to make a logo for my company or any other company.

01/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Fantastic, Kelvin! 
As promised and discussed during our call on Saturday, we will begin the training sessions for the *$300 plan today*! Are you ready for this?🚀

01/11/23, 3:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! To start, I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:
- *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*
01/11/23, 3:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 3:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I guess 3 minutes should be enough to read the first step!
01/11/23, 3:59 pm - +91 90416 75658: I am now done maam
01/11/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
01/11/23, 4:08 pm - +91 90416 75658: I could look for school groups on any social media platform like Facebook or whatsapp then joing and share about Edoofa
01/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, let me share a few more then!
01/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
01/11/23, 4:16 pm - +91 90416 75658: Okay noted thank you. These could be great too
01/11/23, 4:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
01/11/23, 4:19 pm - +91 90416 75658: Okay noted ma’am. Thank you
01/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step  "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
01/11/23, 4:22 pm - +91 90416 75658: Okay noted maam
01/11/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude today's session here. In the next session, we will be discussing this Eligibility check.

As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. I would like you to frame 4-5 questions for yourself by this weekend. I will read them and approve them!
01/11/23, 4:25 pm - +91 90416 75658: Okay noted maam. Thank you for your time
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Thank you for sharing the Wednesday wisdom and I wish you a Happy Diwali
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

15/11/23, 4:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am concluding today's session here.I am sharing your Wednesday lesson, which features an incredibly inspiring story of Alex. I would appreciate it if you could share your views on Alex's journey with me by tomorrow positively.
15/11/23, 4:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

16/11/23, 2:59 pm - +91 90416 75658: Greetings ma'am. I hope you are well today.
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - +91 90416 75658: Alex's story is about an individual who faced a series of challenging circumstances that could have easily dictated the course of his life. Born into a modest family in a neighborhood plagued by crime and limited opportunities, Alex decided to master his circumstances rather than succumbing to the bleak outlook imposed by his surroundings. Despite encountering financial struggles, limited educational resources, and societal prejudices from a young age, Alex used these challenges as stepping stones to fuel his determination.

His key to success was an unwavering belief in the power of mindset. Instead of viewing his circumstances as insurmountable obstacles, he saw them as opportunities for growth and resilience. Recognizing that education was his ticket to a brighter future, he embraced every opportunity to learn, even if it meant studying under the dim light of a street lamp.

As Alex progressed through school, he faced numerous setbacks and hurdles but refused to let these challenges define him. Through sheer determination and hard work, he excelled academically, earning scholarships that paved the way for a college education. His story is a testament to the transformative power of mastering one's circumstances through education.

Throughout his journey, Alex realized the importance of building a support system. He sought out mentors who had overcome similar challenges, learning from their experiences and drawing inspiration from their success stories. By surrounding himself with positive influences, Alex strengthened his resolve and fortified his commitment to mastering his circumstances.

As Alex achieved success in his academic pursuits, he did not forget the community he came from. Instead of allowing his circumstances to create a rift between him and his roots, he actively returned to his neighborhood as a source of inspiration. Alex became involved in mentoring young individuals facing similar challenges, emphasizing the importance of resilience, education, and a positive mindset.

In essence, Alex's story illustrates that the key to mastering one's circumstances lies in cultivating a resilient mindset, making intentional choices, and viewing challenges as opportunities for growth. His tale serves as a beacon of hope, urging everyone to embrace the power within themselves to shape their lives actively, rather than being passively shaped by external forces.

23/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*

23/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 90416 75658: I was not yet your student at that time

Recognizing your potential, I will help in personal training to help you to accumulate substantial scholarship credits. Although you're currently ineligible for the grant, with two months left—November and December—ensure your attendance at every session and webinar from this point onward.
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - +91 90416 75658: How am I ineligible ma’am. Its not that I am not accepting it but I just want to know the reason behind so I can improve for next time
23/11/23, 4:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Who said that you are not eligible, Kelvin? I just want to highlight that the grant is a barrier to your capability.

You need to realize that your dedication is endless, and so is your spirit to win at life. Therefore, I don't want you to settle for such a small amount. You can earn more credits than your grant.

The sky is your limit, Kelvin! Move forward and work well so that you can earn more and more credits. And don't worry, I am here with you, and I will make sure that you achieve this

29/11/23, 3:35 pm - +91 90416 75658: I went through them
29/11/23, 3:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
29/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 90416 75658: Wow. Thats so inspiring.
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
29/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 90416 75658: I am quite blank ma’am😅
29/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 90416 75658: If you could tell me his response. His story is very inspiring to young aspiring entrepreneurs like us
29/11/23, 3:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
29/11/23, 3:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kelvin, where is Bryn?
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - +91 90416 75658: His phone fell so he is not available on whatsapp at three moment. I think I shared this with you on the call we had on Saturday again.
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, however why don't you ask him to join through your phone?
29/11/23, 3:54 pm - +91 90416 75658: Wow. That is great. Linked In is a great tool to success then
29/11/23, 3:54 pm - +91 90416 75658: That day I was not at home. He will join me on the next call
29/11/23, 3:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am suggesting this for the current session!
29/11/23, 3:55 pm - +91 90416 75658: Okay. Let me tell him to come join in
29/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
29/11/23, 4:08 pm - +91 90416 75658: I will make use of Raghav’s story ma’am
29/11/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :
