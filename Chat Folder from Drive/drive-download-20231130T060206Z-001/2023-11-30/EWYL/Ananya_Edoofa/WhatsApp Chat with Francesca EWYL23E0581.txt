Would you like to share a quick introduction?
13/09/23, 2:07 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Well my name is Francesca.....
I love drawing and singing a lot I usually draw and sing during my free time 
And I am passionate about becoming a lawyer
13/09/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Really? Wow! Why don't you show some of your drawings?
13/09/23, 2:09 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Francesca! Share some more!
13/09/23, 2:12 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Sadly I can find the book I usually draw in....
13/09/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That is alright, I understand.
13/09/23, 2:13 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Thank you
13/09/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
13/09/23, 2:18 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Yes I do <This message was edited>
13/09/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Tell me then!
13/09/23, 2:28 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: To get experience through working hard and to earn maximum credits towards the scholarship <This message was edited>
13/09/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
13/09/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
13/09/23, 2:34 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Thank you for the addition
13/09/23, 2:34 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: It has been well understood
13/09/23, 2:35 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: good news for me 😁
13/09/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
13/09/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 2:41 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Wow this is great
13/09/23, 2:41 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: I have read
13/09/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: - Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
13/09/23, 2:46 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Okay
13/09/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
13/09/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 3:07 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: I have read

14/09/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
14/09/23, 2:22 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: I liked the section where there were guides to help overcome hardships and come out stronger
14/09/23, 2:22 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: This message was deleted
14/09/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
14/09/23, 2:32 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Yes I did notice the Edoofa hall of inspiration and i would live to be celebrated and be mentioned by the founder himself
14/09/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from so far discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

14/09/23, 2:50 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: 2. The goal of my mentor is to use her knowledge and experience to give me advice and answer any of my questions and to make sure that I am growing after each and every discussion we may have

17/09/23, 6:27 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Hello
Due to the document above my understanding is that there are 4 guides factors for searching companies namely nature of the company,  scale of the company, financial stability and background of the founder
To follow up there are also 6 steps
The first step is mainly about searching about the company 
Step number two focuses on studying more about the company
step three is about studying the website of the company 
Fourth step includes checking various social media pages of the company 
In step five you study the background of the founder of the company 
The final step studies the background of the people associated with the company
18/09/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
18/09/23, 2:22 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Thank you
18/09/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

19/09/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _Through WhatsApp community groups_

Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
19/09/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: One can create a WhatsApp group where right students will be identified and added to the group. This method is efficient as it can reach out to a number of students with one go. Students who are currently in A level or who have finished can be added to that group. One can start with a catchy line as it will attract more people.
19/09/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
19/09/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

21/09/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.

08/11/23, 3:39 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: I have gone through the six tips
08/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To start, I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:
- *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*

I guess 3 minutes should be enough to read the first step!
08/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 3:44 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Done
08/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
08/11/23, 3:47 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: From my old school
My friend
Neighbours
My friends old schools
My parents friend
church
Other xuls in my area <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 3:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
08/11/23, 3:52 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Yes I have noted
08/11/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
08/11/23, 4:00 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Yes ma'am
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you read those sample questions?
08/11/23, 4:05 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Yes I did
08/11/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! . Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share such questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 4:08 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Yes ma'am 🥲
08/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 4:11 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Okay ma'am
08/11/23, 4:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
08/11/23, 4:15 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Yes ma'am
08/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
08/11/23, 4:32 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Okay
So you have talked about various communication channels
For example Facebook students group where I can encourage fellow peers to join
School friends and parent and colleagues
And that as a certified edoofa student leader I am supposed to share the questions that's you have shared with me on the document
08/11/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Seems like you have now clearly understood the process, and as a Edoofa Certified Student Leader I am sure that you will be able to have a clear mindset while attending to the students for your community-building projects. All the best!🚀
08/11/23, 4:33 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Thank you ma'am
08/11/23, 4:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me remind you about these two:

*Wednesday Wisdom* - Every Wednesday, you will receive a detailed lesson on a specific skill of the week. It follows a well-structured curriculum that promotes skill-based learning and enhances creativity among learners. To unlock the full potential of your learning journey, remember that it's not just about reading the lessons; it's about embarking on a quest where completing the tasks is your treasure map. Each task is a key that unlocks a new realm of knowledge and skills. So, don't just be a reader; be an achiever, a taskmaster who harnesses the true power of education.

*Saturday Activities* - In addition to excelling in academics, students need to acquire skills that will help them enhance the physical, artistic, and emotional aspects of their lives and succeed in this competitive world. Therefore, it is important to apply and revise what you learn in the Wednesday lesson. The Saturday activities motivate students to do the same.
08/11/23, 4:35 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Okay ma'am
08/11/23, 4:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. And here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
