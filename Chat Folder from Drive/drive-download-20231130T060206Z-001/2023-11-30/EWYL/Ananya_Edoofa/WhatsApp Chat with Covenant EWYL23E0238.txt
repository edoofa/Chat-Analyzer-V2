You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

16/08/23, 10:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms with me.
16/08/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 441 1392: Greetings Ma'am. I'm ready for the discussion
16/08/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 441 1392: I'm Ready Ma'am
16/08/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 441 1392: Ok following ✍️
16/08/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 441 1392: Yes I'm fully aware
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 441 1392: Thank you
16/08/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 441 1392: I will keep aiming higher
16/08/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 441 1392: Ok noted
16/08/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 441 1392: Ok. Please can I do the signing tomorrow when I get access to a printer.
16/08/23, 3:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Definitely, Covenant! Make it sign by your parents as well.
16/08/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 441 1392: Ok I will
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟

I have an update to share with you regarding your *student application forms*. The following students have *not responded to our counselors' messages*. I suggest that you connect with them once and understand what has really happened. You can also suggest that they at least connect with the counselors to discuss their career paths.

Nathan Magama
Nonhlanhla Moyo
19/10/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also,  while I was recording your student applications, I saw the other student applications you shared with me. I learned that Anotidaishe Nyevhe, SITERA P, Nezandonyi Tadiwanashe, and Mapipi Artwell,  are in the final stages of eligibility.

Do you think it would be very helpful to the students if you could communicate with these students or their families about everything here in India? It could significantly assist them in moving closer to the scholarship program. What do you think? <This message was edited>

08/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _Let us begin our EWYL Group session_

Check out these six powerful tips for transforming yourself into a dream achiever:
Link: https://www.instagram.com/p/CzVl_ADBbbz/?img_index=1
08/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 79019 93590: I have read them.They are really powerful
08/11/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?
08/11/23, 2:47 pm - +91 79019 93590: Yes sure
08/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 79019 93590: 1. What motivates you to study your higher education in India?
2. Where do you see yourself 5 years after graduating?
3. How do you think studying abroad will be beneficial not only to you but your home country.
4. What kind of  opportunities do you think you will get from studying abroad under Edoofa other than other scholarships? <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 79019 93590: Ok Ma'am
08/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 79019 93590: Yes sure
08/11/23, 2:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step *"International Student Admission Eligibility Check"*
08/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 79019 93590: Yes sure
08/11/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
08/11/23, 3:08 pm - +91 79019 93590: Firstly To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:
1.Facebook Student Community Building Group
2.School Friends Juniors Connect
3.parents' friends
4. Relatives, friends of friends
 Then In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship.
The international students Admission Eligibility test is important to avoid instances where students skip the information I share with them without reading, and when they are asked by the counselors about the same thing it will sound new to them
08/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Seems like you have now clearly understood the process, and as a Edoofa Certified Student Leader I am sure that you will be able to have a clear mindset while attending to the students for your community-building projects. All the best!🚀
08/11/23, 3:14 pm - +91 79019 93590: Thank you
08/11/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now,, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your *Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity*. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 3:16 pm - +91 79019 93590: Noted Ma'am. Eagerly looking forward to them
08/11/23, 3:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me remind you about these two:

*Wednesday Wisdom* - Every Wednesday, you will receive a detailed lesson on a specific skill of the week. It follows a well-structured curriculum that promotes skill-based learning and enhances creativity among learners. To unlock the full potential of your learning journey, remember that it's not just about reading the lessons; it's about embarking on a quest where completing the tasks is your treasure map. Each task is a key that unlocks a new realm of knowledge and skills. So, don't just be a reader; be an achiever, a taskmaster who harnesses the true power of education.

*Saturday Activities* - In addition to excelling in academics, students need to acquire skills that will help them enhance the physical, artistic, and emotional aspects of their lives and succeed in this competitive world. Therefore, it is important to apply and revise what you learn in the Wednesday lesson. The Saturday activities motivate students to do the same.
08/11/23, 3:19 pm - +91 79019 93590: Nice 👍
08/11/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. I want to inform you that, due to the occasion of Diwali, I won't be available from the 10th of October to the 13th of October. During this time, I encourage you to read our Wednesday lessons for today and provide me with your understanding of the significance of Diwali by tomorrow. I look forward to your response.
08/11/23, 3:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

09/11/23, 5:16 pm - +91 79019 93590: Diwali stands as a testament to the profound wisdom
embedded in Indian culture. It exemplifies the timeless values of
righteousness, knowledge, gratitude, and unity. 
Diwali imparts several valuable lessons that resonate deeply with the
human spirit. Firstly, it teaches the importance of inner illumination,
encouraging individuals to dispel ignorance and cultivate knowledge
and wisdom. The lighting of diyas signifies the enlightenment of the
soul, urging people to seek self-realization and spiritual growth.
Secondly, Diwali emphasizes the significance of gratitude and
generosity. During this festival, families share their joy and wealth
with others, be it through charity, gifts, or communal feasts. This
practice fosters empathy, kindness, and a sense of interconnectedness
within society, fostering a spirit of unity and compassion.

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you tomorrow.

*Date: 23/11/2023*
*Time: 6:00 PM*
23/11/23, 9:52 am - +91 79019 93590: Noted Ms Ananya
23/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Covenant!🌸
I hope you are doing well. Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
23/11/23, 2:36 pm - +91 79019 93590: Yes
23/11/23, 2:36 pm - +91 79019 93590: Ma'am
23/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $300 annually. 
Do you remember this?
23/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 79019 93590: Yes I remember Ma'am
23/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, Can you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? To make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy those guidelines obediently. 
Can you recall what they were?
23/11/23, 2:44 pm - +91 79019 93590: Yeah I remember some of the guidelines. It stated that I'm supposed to have 75% or above attendance in the Edoofa activities, which include the Saturday , Wednesday activities etc.
23/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
23/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 79019 93590: Yes I remember these too
23/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Over the last few months, we've been checking how well you're doing. We've been keeping an eye on whether you're showing up for our weekly calls, and webinars, and completing the tasks I've given you, like submitting reviews, usernames, testimonial videos, and so on. 


The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*
23/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 79019 93590: Yes
23/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits.
23/11/23, 2:53 pm - +91 79019 93590: Yes I understand Ma'am
23/11/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75%.
