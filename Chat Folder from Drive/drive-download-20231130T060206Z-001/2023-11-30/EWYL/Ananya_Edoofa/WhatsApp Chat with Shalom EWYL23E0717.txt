05/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 683 2254: OK Ms Ananya
06/10/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 683 2254: No I don't understand what the two objectives are Ms Ananya
06/10/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/10/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Thank you Ms Ananya I've now understood what the two objectives are all about
06/10/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
06/10/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 683 2254: I've read the screenshot Ms Ananya 

It's nice to know that one can earn so much through the EWYL program 


And I would also want to earn such through hardwork and determination
06/10/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
06/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 683 2254: OK Ms Ananya 
I'm ready to start to start thre EWYL journey with the help of you, Ms Davi and Ms Sanjana
06/10/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
06/10/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 683 2254: This message was deleted
06/10/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if you have read the document or not?
06/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 683 2254: I've read the document Ms Ananya 

And l must say I'm also lucky to be part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and l would also one day want to be sharing my story of my Edoofa program with other Scholars like Ms Swarna Akhter has done
06/10/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly share your understaning with me before our next session. Our next session is on Monday. We do not have our sessions on Saturdays and Sundays. 

Happy Weekend!🌸
06/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 683 2254: What I've understood from the document is that 
One must learn to use time wisely and that the decisions we make have an impact on our daily lives and future . I also got some quotes that motivated me to shape my future and also learnt something through Mr Angad Singh story 


I also got the background of the Edoofa Scholarship founder Mr Angad Singh
06/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Same to you Ms Ananya 

Have a happy weekend🌺

Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of.

After school, once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
10/10/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Good evening Ms Ananya
10/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Wanted to ask if I'm supposed to do both of the project , The one where I have to collect information about a certain company and the one that involves my community..or I'm supposed to choose one project to do from the two projects
11/10/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Shalom!

There are three projects, I think you missed the last project.
11/10/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: You have to work on all of these; however, as of now, we have put the first project on hold. Once we resume, we will work on this together.

I'm ready
12/10/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/10/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Shalom, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
12/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 683 2254: OK noted Ms Ananya will surely do so
12/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 683 2254: So what's the next step of our session
12/10/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday - 9:30 am to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
12/10/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
12/10/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
12/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay Ms Ananya have taken note of the timing of my sessions but l have a bit of a challenge with keeping up with that time as I will  at school from 7:30am to 4pm and phones ain't allowed at school
12/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 683 2254: OK Ms Ananya
12/10/23, 4:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand. Would you like to temporarily pause our sessions until you've completed your exams, or would you prefer to continue with the new schedule?
14/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Good evening Ms Ananya I've sent the emails
19/10/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I know you're all deep into your studies, and that's fantastic! 📚 But I wanted to share an incredible video with you that I believe can help alleviate some of the exam stress. 🌟

29/11/23, 12:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shalom! @263786832254 @263772968339 

I hope you are doing well. You know, many of my student's exams are over now, and they are all set to resume their EWYL journey and take a step toward their future education without wasting a single day of their holidays!
