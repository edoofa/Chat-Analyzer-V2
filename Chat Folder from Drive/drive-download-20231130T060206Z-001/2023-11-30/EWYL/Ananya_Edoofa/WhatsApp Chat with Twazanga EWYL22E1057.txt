11/08/23, 4:27 pm - +260 95 7604595: Good evening dear parents and team! I have exciting news for you my parents. I am embarking on this amazing project from team Edoofa. It is called the $300 dollar package. All I have to do is invite people to join Edoofa and make sure they go through all the processes and finally come here to India. I have to invite atleast 3 students to join the program and for each payment they make for the enrollment, registration and departure i will be given $100 which totals to $300. So if i manage to get three students to come in a year, I’ll have $900 which will go to my school fees. This amount is almost my entire school fees for two semesters! All I need is your support and I know I will definitely pull through
11/08/23, 4:31 pm - +260 96 1804241: Good Evening Twazanga, this is good news indeed. You have our support on this exciting project. We will help you to recruit as many  students as possible 👍

05/10/23, 3:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So these are the following questions:

-A short intro of yourself.
-What was the event all about?
-Share your personal experience.
-Share a note for your fellow Edoofians!
05/10/23, 3:32 pm - +260 95 7604595: Hello everyone!🌟 my name is Twazanga  Nayame, I am a student at Lovely Professional University in Punjab. I’m in my first year studying Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. I come from Zambia, a beautiful country and home of one of the seven wonders of the world, the mighty victory falls, also called “Mosi oa-Tunya” which means “smoke that thunders”⚡️ Zambia is rich in mineral resources, natural resources and is a land full of cultural diversity as it has 72 tribes. I could go on and on talking about my country as I love it so much🇿🇲😅.


On 04/10/23, my school hosted an international student photo shoot in which only one student was supposed to wear a native attire from their home country. 

I was selected by my fellow zambian students to represent our country Zambia in the event.
My experience being a participant was good. I got to meet people from different countries and I had the privilege to interact with some of them and learn one or two things about their culture.

To my fellow Edoofians, I’d like to encourage you to embrace the many opportunities you may come across, the effect may not be seen right there and then but with time and patience, it’ll surely happen. One good turn leads to another, one day you might become the next big thing!🚀
05/10/23, 4:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for your response, Twazanga! 

Also, I wanted to share something exciting with you today. I've been part of an incredible journey as a mentor, and I'm thrilled to show you a reel that features not just me, but also some of my co-mentors.✨

10/10/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday

18/10/23, 3:37 pm - +260 95 7604595: Most of the people I socialize with are in boarding schools because I was in a boarding school
18/10/23, 3:37 pm - +260 95 7604595: There’s not many good day schools in my town that could have students that can afford to come here
18/10/23, 3:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you attend a day school or a boarding school?
18/10/23, 3:41 pm - +260 95 7604595: I was at a boarding school
18/10/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so are you connected with any of your juniors?
18/10/23, 3:47 pm - +260 95 7604595: Yes but the people that are interested already applied before the 300 dollar plan came about
18/10/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Twazanga! Have you tried searching for students on facebook?
18/10/23, 3:55 pm - +260 95 7604595: Trust me, with the number of scammers on Facebook these days, it wouldn’t work
18/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would still recommend to try Twazanga!
18/10/23, 4:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let's conclude today's session. We will connect according to our timetable.

18/10/23, 4:28 pm - +260 95 7604595: Alright Ms Ananya, goodnight
26/10/23, 3:00 pm - +260 95 7604595: <Media omitted>

01/11/23, 2:44 pm - +260 95 7604595: I’m kindly asking for permission to postpone this session to a later day as I am working on a CA which is due today.
01/11/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Twazanga! Let us do one thing  I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:
- *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*
01/11/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 3:08 pm - +260 95 7604595: Before we discuss this further, I have a question. Before the $300 plan was introduced, my parents and I actively participated in engaging 2 schools with Edoofa. Even so, I also introduced a person to Edoofa and he is currently here in India through me. How is it that I have not earned a single dollar for that?
01/11/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will help you with that, Twazanga! Can I know the names of those students?
01/11/23, 3:12 pm - +260 95 7604595: Chinyama Mushivi and I engaged MCM Mufulira trust school and Chati South Secondary School
01/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, kindly give me some time. I will give you an update regarding this.
01/11/23, 3:14 pm - +260 95 7604595: Alright ma’am
01/11/23, 3:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: All the best for your CA!

08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 5:24 pm - +260 95 7604595: Good evening Ms Ananya
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

Check out these six powerful tips for transforming yourself into a dream achiever:

15/11/23, 2:37 pm - +260 95 7604595: Good evening ma’am
15/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
15/11/23, 2:41 pm - +260 95 7604595: For the Edoofa program?
15/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes!
15/11/23, 2:43 pm - +260 95 7604595: Social organizations like schools, churches, associations and organizations
15/11/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - +260 95 7604595: Alright
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
15/11/23, 2:52 pm - +260 95 7604595: Noted!
15/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. 

Kindly read that!
15/11/23, 3:15 pm - +260 95 7604595: Which one is it Ms Ananya?
15/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here, Twazanga!
15/11/23, 3:26 pm - +260 95 7604595: I’ve gone through it
15/11/23, 3:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, did you notice the questions?
15/11/23, 3:28 pm - +260 95 7604595: Yes
15/11/23, 3:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great,Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
15/11/23, 3:32 pm - +260 95 7604595: Okay
15/11/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
15/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
15/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end, but since our session time is over, I am concluding today's session here.

I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program. This marks an end to your training!

I am sharing your Wednesday lesson, which features an incredibly inspiring story of Alex. I would appreciate it if you could share your views on Alex's journey with me by tomorrow positively.
15/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

18/11/23, 11:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Congratulations_*

Now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*🏆
18/11/23, 12:16 pm - +260 95 7604595: Thank you Ms Ananya
22/11/23, 9:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Grant Discussion: Guidelines_*

Let's revisit the time when Mr. Angad visited your country and promised you a Grant. Now that you are approaching your second semester, that time has arrived and therefore, I would like to discuss its eligibility.

I am confident you will excel in this discussion! I have scheduled our meeting for the following:

*Time: 7:00 PM*
*Date: 23/11/2023* <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 1:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 1:11 pm - +260 95 7604595: I have read it
23/11/23, 3:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Twazanga!🌸
I hope you are doing well. Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
23/11/23, 3:38 pm - +260 95 7604595: Yes I am
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
23/11/23, 3:46 pm - +260 95 7604595: That’s a great approach
23/11/23, 3:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago? 
Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving .
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - +260 95 7604595: The title of student leader?
23/11/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This Twazanga!
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - +260 95 7604595: Oh great!
23/11/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
23/11/23, 4:19 pm - +260 95 7604595: Indeed! The sky is not the limit, I’ll keep aiming higher
23/11/23, 4:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - +260 95 7604595: Okay
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the next semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.

5. I am sure you remember that a minimum of 75% attendance is required. We are currently analyzing your attendance and engagement during our sessions and the webinar. If all the requirements are seen to be fulfilled, you will be able to redeem the grant
23/11/23, 4:24 pm - +260 95 7604595: Can you please explain the first point further… does this mean that if I earn more credits than the grant and I choose the credits, the grant will never be given to me?
23/11/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: According to the document, you have the opportunity to redeem either of them, and the great news is that the higher quantum will be selected. This means that you have the chance to benefit from the more substantial option.
23/11/23, 4:29 pm - +260 95 7604595: Alright
23/11/23, 4:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant.

25/11/23, 8:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Twazanga!

Over the past few weeks, I have observed that, due to your classes, exams, and other events, it has been difficult for you to manage calls in the evening. Keeping this in mind, I thought of extending my working hours for you and have changed the timing for the call today.

Time: *8:00 PM*
Video call link: *https://meet.google.com/vwr-sezp-ixr*
25/11/23, 8:17 am - +260 95 7604595: Good morning Ms Ananya
25/11/23, 8:18 am - +260 95 7604595: That’s really nice of you, see you over the call
25/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly Join the call!
25/11/23, 5:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Saturday activity*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline: Monday, 25th November 2023*
25/11/23, 6:00 pm - +260 95 7604595: Ma’am there is an error with the date, is it supposed to be Monday or today?
25/11/23, 6:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for it. You can submit it by Monday.
25/11/23, 6:02 pm - +260 95 7604595: Alright Ms Ananya
27/11/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Twazanga!

I've personally looked into how active you've been in the last two months, and I've found some important details to discuss. These findings are crucial because they'll determine whether you qualify for the Grant.

To discuss this, I've scheduled a session with you today at *6:45 PM* in your EWYL group. I hope to see you there before your call so that we can discuss more during the call. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 2:11 pm - +260 95 7604595: Alright ma’am
27/11/23, 2:27 pm - +260 95 7604595: According to me, the spirit of competition means the thrill or desire to be better than others. It can also be the feeling of achieving something higher than your aim. 
The spirit of competition has helped me achieve some of the things I hold as big achievements in my life. When I was in primary school, I developed the talent of swimming. I was one of the very best in the school. I was selected to represent the school at an international level. At first, I came out last or close to last in my first races but that never stopped me from training harder and trying again. Eventually, I started rising to the top till I came out second place and got a bronze medal for it. 
The spirit of competition is an important virtue as it helps us achieve success, internally and externally.
27/11/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, Twazanga!  🌟🏆Keep harnessing that competitive spirit—it's a powerful force for achieving goals and overcoming challenges. Your efforts and achievements are truly commendable!
27/11/23, 2:36 pm - +260 95 7604595: Thank you Ms Ananya!
27/11/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Twazanga, are you ready for the discussion?
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - +260 95 7604595: Yes ma’am
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:37 pm - +260 95 7604595: Alright
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - +260 95 7604595: Okay, please go ahead
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - +260 95 7604595: Great!
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, you have to maintain your consistency throughout, to maintain 75% attendance. 

 I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - +260 95 7604595: Yes I am
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I'm really happy to tell you that Nicassio from your college earned *more* credits than his grant last month. He understood that a grant has a limit, but credits don't. With the $300 plan, he's living his dreams and making his parents proud. He achieved this in just a month! Imagine the results if he continues on this trajectory.
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - +260 95 7604595: That’s nice for him
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While listening to him from Ms. Jasmine, who has been mentoring him to earn more and more credits and fulfilling his dream life, I could have imagined you in his place. Out of all the students on that star list, I immediately thought of you as our next star performer as I know you have the capability to achieve something similar.
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, not only me but Ms. Sanjana has also seen your dedication closely. And since there is no doubt that you are responsible and dedicated, we have decided to guide you through this with special attention and some extra sessions.
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - +260 95 7604595: Well, I just hope for the best because I have tried talking to students but if they are not giving in, I can’t force them
27/11/23, 4:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:04 pm - +260 95 7604595: I will continue but the responses I’ve been receiving are demotivating
27/11/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity by not only redeeming your grant amount but *greater, by earning unlimited scholarship credits.* 

Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - +260 95 7604595: Alright
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I can confirm that with this target thi s December you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
27/11/23, 4:13 pm - +260 95 7604595: By this December?
27/11/23, 4:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, this is the plan you can opt for if you wish to pay your fee yourself, and I am sure I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - +260 95 7604595: I mean, even if I were to find candidates that are willing, it’s not possible that they’d have paid all their fees by December
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, you have whole January to pay your fee Twazanga, so if you try hard you can easily earn more than the Grant amount.
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - +260 95 7604595: I’m supposed to pay my first semester fee by 31st December
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, let me confirm this with my team because as far as I am aware you have a chance to submit it by January!
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - +260 95 7604595: For real? They sent a notification to my ums that my fees are due by 31st December
27/11/23, 4:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me consult my team, I will let you know by tomorrow!
27/11/23, 4:43 pm - +260 95 7604595: Okay
29/11/23, 7:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder: EWYL Group session is back!_*

Arthur, This is to remind you that we have our session scheduled for *today at 6:00 PM*

As you move ahead in your academic journey, I am sure you realize the financial responsibility that comes along with it. I can understand how overwhelming it can it initially but let me assure you that without constant discussions we can manage to work to the fullest in the $300 plan. 

Remember that I have set some goals for you and now it has become my personal agenda to see you achieve that.
So, let's make the most of the session so that we can maximize our impact on our progress📈

29/11/23, 2:38 pm - +260 95 7604595: Good evening Ms Ananya
29/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Twazanga! So, before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
29/11/23, 2:41 pm - +260 95 7604595: Wow, that’s a great achievement
29/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
29/11/23, 2:43 pm - +260 95 7604595: Please do tell me😂
29/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, try to guess Twazanga!😄
29/11/23, 2:49 pm - +260 95 7604595: I’m bad at this 😂
29/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
29/11/23, 2:57 pm - +260 95 7604595: Wow! That’s really impressive
29/11/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
29/11/23, 2:59 pm - +260 95 7604595: Exactly! I’ll work towards that
29/11/23, 3:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :
29/11/23, 3:21 pm - +260 95 7604595: Learning online certification courses
