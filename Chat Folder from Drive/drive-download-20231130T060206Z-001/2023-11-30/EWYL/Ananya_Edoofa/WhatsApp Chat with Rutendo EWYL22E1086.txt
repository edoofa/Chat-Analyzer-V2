To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

16/08/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🌟
16/08/23, 3:15 pm - +91 89683 69740: Greatings ma'am yes l am ready for the session
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:17 pm - +91 89683 69740: Yes l am read ma'am,go ahead
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:20 pm - +91 89683 69740: Yes that's true ma'am,one can work hard knowing that their education is covered for real
16/08/23, 3:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:22 pm - +91 89683 69740: I know lts given to people who show hardwork and who are not in thir comfort zones,it is given to people who are not reluctant but to those who stand up for their future,so l assume its the reason why there is this grant
16/08/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:28 pm - +91 89683 69740: Wow am elated ma'am thankyou
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 5:18 pm - +91 89683 69740: Sure ma'am l believe l can do it....
16/08/23, 5:22 pm - +91 89683 69740: I am sorry l went offline unnoticed

Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

15/11/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dear Students,

Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $175 annually. 
Do you remember this? <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 89683 69740: Yes sure l remember that
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly.

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

27/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - +91 89683 69740: I attended All webners ma'am. And sessions l missed 2 in September ma'am, and sure at the orientation l wasnt there
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 89683 69740: Ma'am lf l put effort will l redeem this grant amount l lost now?
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Rutendo, the orientation program was the one where we all came to your college and you did not attend that. Remember?
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 89683 69740: Or it is starting afresh?
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 89683 69740: Yes thats why l said l wasn't there.
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that Rutendo would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.

My aim is not to compare Rutendo you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You can work for your next semester, Rutendo!
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 89683 69740: Okay noted
27/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Do you know why I shared this with you? Because I want you to think of the long-term picture, you might be in a position to use these credits for the coming term, but what about next year, next to next year?
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 89683 69740: Okay l understand
27/11/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents to fullest_
27/11/23, 3:16 pm - +91 89683 69740: Well ma'am,you can tell me rhe way to improve the performance
27/11/23, 3:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, Rutendo!
27/11/23, 3:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
27/11/23, 3:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want to share fact with you that many of you are not realizing, while the grant amount is limited, there's no cap on earning scholarship credits.
Recognizing your potential, I will help in personal training to help you to accumulate substantial scholarship credits. Although you're currently ineligible for the grant, with two months left—November and December—ensure your attendance at every session and webinar from this point onward.
