15/11/23, 10:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Emmanuel!

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I'm thrilled to witness your enthusiasm for the EWYL project, and I'm equally excited to embark on this amazing journey with you.

However, please excuse the slight delay in the process. I've been occupied with the orientation at our partner university, and we recently had a small Diwali break, which made it a bit challenging to connect with my students for a short period.
15/11/23, 10:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: By the way, to give you a glimpse of the festivities and orientation, I've attached a few photos. It was a joyous celebration, and the orientation went well too. I thought you might enjoy seeing how Diwali is celebrated here in India and the positive energy from our orientation sessions.

17/11/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Emmanuel, kindly excuse me for not being able to continue our discussion, as I was engaged in an important conversation with the head of our department, Ms. Sanjana. We discussed how we can help our students acquire quality skills that will make them job-ready.

I am confident that we will generate some brilliant ideas. In the meantime, I would like you to share some unique skills you wish to learn before coming to India! We shall discuss this in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays."
17/11/23, 3:05 pm - +260 96 7415696: Ok thanks so much I will be waiting, have good day!

20/11/23, 10:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Emmanuel, it's great to learn more about you. However, since I can't wait to begin our journey, let's connect today at 1:30 p.m. to compensate for our previous session.
20/11/23, 10:17 am - +260 96 7415696: Ok thanks will be there
20/11/23, 1:29 pm - +260 96 7415696: *Dear Mentor, my name is Emmanuel Chana, and my EWYL group name is Emmanuel EWYL23E0741. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 21/11/2023 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Emmanuel! 🌞

Here's a little inspiration to start our day: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue those counts.' - Winston Churchill. Now, let us begin our session with enthusiasm and a quest for knowledge. 📚✨
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - +260 96 7415696: Good afternoon
20/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - +260 96 7415696: Not quite, if you can  elaborate more on that
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - +260 96 7415696: I understand
20/11/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - +260 96 7415696: Ok thanks
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/11/23, 2:20 pm - +260 96 7415696: Yes
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

20/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As our virtual session draws to a close, remember that knowledge is a journey, not a destination. Let the ideas percolate, and may your curiosity continue to spark new adventures. Until our digital paths cross again, keep the learning flame alive. Stay inspired, stay curious, and embrace the wonders that each moment brings. Until next time, champions of wisdom! 🚀
20/11/23, 2:28 pm - +260 96 7415696: Surely Knowledge is  a journey
21/11/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning! 🚀

23/11/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
23/11/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 7643534: That sounds great
23/11/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
23/11/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 9:27 am - +260 97 7643534: I have finished reading it
23/11/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: As today wraps up, get excited for tomorrow, it's full of possibilities! Meanwhile, I want you to share your understanding of our projects before our session tomorrow. 

We'll catch up at 8:30 am to kickstart a new day of enthusiasm. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 9:33 am - +260 97 7643534: Thanks ma'am it was really interesting have a good day
23/11/23, 7:36 pm - +260 97 7643534: The projects are meant to enhance and make us aware of the dynamic generation we are in thus equipping us with necessary tools of knowledge to race at the speed of modern change.
There three projects in the EWYL program but I'll tend to sum it up the first being the corporate alliances of my understanding its a project aiming at EWYL edoofian students to help edoofa corporate with the businesses, companies that are aligned with educational interest to help edoofa have many partners.
The second one is community building of which by my understanding is that us students of edoofa need to motivate and persuade our fellow youths who have finshed or yet to finish school and advise them on the works of edoofa and the goodness of the edoofa program,thus meaning bringing more to the program who are not aware of the problem yet.
And the last is african schools educational reform mission 
This lets us edoofian students to seek for school that can partner up with edoofa so it would be easy to for edoofa to access more pupils who have finished.
That was my summary and in conlusion i read and learnt that with each step you take in making project come into reality we are awarded with scholarship credits will posse as great help in lessening the burden of our parents
23/11/23, 7:46 pm - +260 97 5363915: Surely it is a helpful program that will benefit many who needs to build up bright future. It's really a good program.
24/11/23, 8:43 am - +260 97 7643534: Good morning ma'am
24/11/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Emmanuel!

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx.
24/11/23, 8:52 am - +260 97 7643534: I now know
24/11/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great,  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
24/11/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 9:03 am - +260 97 7643534: I have heard it ma'am
24/11/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
24/11/23, 9:09 am - +260 97 7643534: He say that in the first project which is the corporate alliance we are to seek for technological or digital companies and tell them or introduce them to the edoofa thus seting up a meeting with the edoofa for better communication between the companies and the edoofa.we can talk to different companies by the help of a LinkedIn app
24/11/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, Emmanuel. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
24/11/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 9:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, let us conclude our session here and get ready for more enthusiasm on Monday at 8:30 am. We do not have sessions over the weekend, so recharge and come back ready to rock!

Happy Weekend! 🚀
24/11/23, 9:30 am - +260 97 7643534: I have read I'll write of my understanding and queries then until tgen have a good day ma'am
27/11/23, 8:18 am - +260 97 7643534: My understanding of this is that we must consider the nature of the  companies if they are digital operative  and also we must put in considerasion the scale of the company eg is this firm operative on a large scale or small though we must be moderate when choosing. And also if the company is finacially stable, and before going any further we must learn of its background and the background  if the founder to know of there achievements. there after they are steps we are to put in consideration like first thing we search of the company learn of it its background and see if it is operative on apps, websites or social media for easy access
27/11/23, 8:33 am - +260 97 7643534: Good morning ma'am
27/11/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Emmanuel!

Did you know that India and Africa share a rich history of diplomatic and trade relations that dates back centuries? The strong bond between these two regions has been further strengthened in recent years through collaborative efforts in various sectors, including trade, infrastructure, and technology.
27/11/23, 8:47 am - +260 97 7643534: That's very good
27/11/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 7643534: I summarized what i understood

27/11/23, 8:52 am - +260 97 7643534: Thank you ma'am
27/11/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

27/11/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: We have decided to put this project on hold for now. Once we resume, you can begin your search. Is that alright?
27/11/23, 9:03 am - +260 97 7643534: Okay
27/11/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Emmanuel, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Emmanuel!
27/11/23, 9:18 am - +260 97 7643534: Yes
27/11/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 9:27 am - +260 97 7643534: I understood it says that we are to approach our friends or student's that have recently or still to finish secondary education. But we should  keep in condideration if those who are serious at academic stuffs and after we have made a list of those who are interested then we are to inform the groups and as they consult with there families then we must send them a form to fill which is going to be given to me and all who are to do this project then at the end we are to submit it in the groups
27/11/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great!
27/11/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our one-hour session time is over, I feel like we could have covered more if we had started our session on time.

Starting tomorrow, I'd appreciate it if you could send me a message on EWYL 5 minutes before our session. This way, we can make the best out of our time together.

I hope I won't have to wait for you at the session time and then send you a text.

Have a good day!
27/11/23, 9:29 am - +260 97 7643534: Lets make it 10 min before the session so it would last a bit longer  I'll do that have a good day too ma'am

28/11/23, 8:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Emmanuel!

*_Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:_*

The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.🤯🗼
28/11/23, 8:23 am - +260 97 7643534: That's fascinating
28/11/23, 8:29 am - +260 97 7643534: Am ready for the session

28/11/23, 8:34 am - +260 97 7643534: I understand
28/11/23, 8:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
28/11/23, 8:37 am - +260 97 7643534: Okay am following
28/11/23, 8:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/11/23, 8:41 am - +260 97 7643534: Okay
28/11/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
28/11/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/11/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
28/11/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
28/11/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/11/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

28/11/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 8:57 am - +260 97 7643534: Please correct me if am right so to my understanding i should create a WhatsApp group with you included and then i should be search and telling those applocants who want to be in the edoofa program to join the group so vast information can be shared about edoofa and also gather more people through the same group if am not mistaken
28/11/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, Emmanuel!
28/11/23, 8:59 am - +260 97 7643534: Okay i understand
28/11/23, 9:01 am - +260 97 7643534: So for the form should i write it to them like the same format above or i have to print them and capture it
28/11/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/11/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
28/11/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
28/11/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
28/11/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
28/11/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
28/11/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
28/11/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.
