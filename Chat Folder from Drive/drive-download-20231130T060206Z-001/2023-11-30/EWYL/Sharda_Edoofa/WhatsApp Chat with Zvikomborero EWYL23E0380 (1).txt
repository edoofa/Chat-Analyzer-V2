02/08/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Good Job*, Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

17/08/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 203 3411: Guide for searching companies
The task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with EDOOFA and are 
willing to extend their help in the overall development of all the students that enrol for 
the EDOOFA programme. To make sure that one looks for the right type of companies, 
one must keep into consideration the following factors:
a) NATURE OF COMPANY: The nature of company must be either student-centric 
(for eg: career development platforms, ed-tech platforms,) or it could be recreational 
(for eg: virtual gaming platforms, podcasts/music apps, social interaction platforms) or it 
could be a content-centric platform ( news apps, blogs etc)
 Few examples:
1) For Ed-tech platforms: Brainshare, Obami
Source: https://www.itnewsafrica.com/2019/02/top-10-edtech-startups-transforming￾learning-in-africa/
2) For Recreational/App-based platforms: OurHood, PalmPay
Source: https://disrupt-africa.com/2016/02/5-african-social-networking-startups-to-watch/
3) For Content centric platforms: Africazilla, Over Saturated
Source: https://blog.feedspot.com/south_africa_news_websites/

b) SCALE OF COMPANY: The scale of the selected company should not be either too 
big or too small. Keep into consideration the employee size of the company (can vary 
from 50-200)
c) FINANCIAL STABILITY: Companies so selected must be financially sound. 
Checking the recent funding updates from various sources like Crunchbase, LinkedIn, 
Inc42 Media can help.
d) BACKGROUND OF FOUNDER: Companies with a founder having a strong 
background (in terms of experiences and qualifications) are the most suitable ones. 
 Few examples:
1) https://www.linkedin.com/in/gossy/?originalSubdomain=ng
This is the profile of a founder working on a new project (gaming industry). It 
is clear from his work experience and background, how relevant he must be in 
his industry, what his network be like and how successful he must be.
2) https://www.linkedin.com/in/godwinbenson/
Another founder, who has been working in the education industry for 5 years. 
Prior to that, he was also engaged in startup endeavours, also worked with 
some big names. This gives credibility to how he has built his career and how 
serious he is about the growth of his current company.
Platforms that can be used: Google, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Inc4media, Internshala(or 
any other internship providing sources), Social media pages( Facebook, Instagram, 
Twitter),
1) Techzim: https://www.techzim.co.zw/tag/zimbabwean-startups/
(platform to find information regarding start-ups in Zimbabwe)
2) https://nigeria.startups-list.com/
3) https://www.ghanayello.com/companies/startups

Step 1: Searching
For Google: You can use keywords like – “recently funded start-ups in 
Nigeria/Ghana/Zimbabwe you are focussing on in 2019”, “young entrepreneurs 
from _____”. After typing any such keyword, you need to open the links and read from 
in between and find the names of companies that suit your requirement.
You can also search for “start-up news” and get links for various media platforms that 
update constant activities of all the start-ups. (For eg: Inc4media in India is a platform 
that provides news and information for Indian start-ups)
For LinkedIn: Start connecting with founders of few start-ups and explore their 
connections, activities to get a constant update. You can also get all the necessary 
information right from the employee scale to the funding updates of any company by 
searching on LinkedIn and exploring the company page.
There are following tabs on a LinkedIn page of a company-

15/09/23, 9:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 9:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
15/09/23, 9:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
15/09/23, 9:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
15/09/23, 9:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

15/09/23, 9:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 9:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

MANICALAND
16/09/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the *School is not connected* with Edoofa:
16/09/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
16/09/23, 9:38 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the *School is connected* with Edoofa:

It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
16/09/23, 9:38 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
16/09/23, 9:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
16/09/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 203 3411: yes

19/09/23, 9:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations.
19/09/23, 9:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.
