We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
22/09/23, 1:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
22/09/23, 1:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
22/09/23, 1:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.

22/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 747 4278: Yes Madam
22/09/23, 1:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
22/09/23, 1:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
22/09/23, 1:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: How does that sound, Precious?

30/09/23, 9:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening, Precious!
I trust you're doing well

Our conversation on call was truly enjoyable, and I'd like to kindly remind you of the three tasks you need to complete:

📍 Please ask your *parents to confirm in this group that you've discussed the $300 plan with them*.
📍 *Share a screenshot* of the *Google review* you write for Edoofa.
📍 *share a screenshot* of the *Facebook review* you write for Edoofa.
03/10/23, 8:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
