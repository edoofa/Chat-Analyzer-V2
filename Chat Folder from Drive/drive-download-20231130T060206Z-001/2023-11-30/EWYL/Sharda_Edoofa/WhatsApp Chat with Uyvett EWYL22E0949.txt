I hope you will be available for your EWYL after November 15th.
15/09/23, 9:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Uvyett

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 2:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: That is indeed a great news. Looking forward to the session on saturday.
03/10/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Uvyett

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: *During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family*

 *I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023. We will have our session from 8:30am to 9:30am on Tuesday*
Kindly be available for the same. 
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

14/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 210 4454: Her availability starts tomorrow after attending her last exam then back home
15/11/23, 8:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Uvyett*
In the spirit of our session today, I'd like to share this simple yet powerful quote: 'Believe you can, and you're halfway there.' – Theodore Roosevelt.

_Through WhatsApp community groups_

Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
21/11/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 072 9798: I understand the credits
21/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 072 9798: I understood that I am supposed to reach out to A level students...form six students...for a start..I may begin with my former xul mates
21/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 072 9798: To connect with them I create a group and share it in other groups tt have upper six students
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 072 9798: In this group I convey necessary information about edoof with my mentor also being a part of this group
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Uyvett, I am impressed with your understanding.
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, this is how you have to make sure that the application form is filled
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

23/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.'

23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
23/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 072 9798: Let me listen to it then

23/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 072 9798: Am really sorry..it seems to be taking a while to download
23/11/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is alright Uyvett. I can completely understand it.
23/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 072 9798: So I understood that the third project involves reaching out to different schools and talking to the headmasters
23/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 072 9798: It would be necessary to explain to them how I joined edoofa and also how our journey so far has been
23/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 072 9798: I must be able to set up a way for the edoofian directors to communicate with the headmasters I would have talked to
23/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 072 9798: For a start I would begin by reaching out to my former school headmaster
23/11/23, 2:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session*.

Let's start our session with a bit of inspiration:
*"Your attitude determines your direction."*
