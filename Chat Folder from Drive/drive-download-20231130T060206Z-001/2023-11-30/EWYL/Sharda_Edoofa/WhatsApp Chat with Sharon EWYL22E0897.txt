I trust you are in good health.

I understand that *Sharon* is currently occupied with ongoing exams, and I want to ensure my student doesn't miss out on any valuable learning opportunities. Therefore, I'd like to share today's weekly newsletter, which you can review at your convenience.

19/10/23, 4:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would really appreciate it, if you can go through the newsletter and share your understanding of the same.
This will ensure we are on the same page.
19/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 784 6333: From the newsletter I learnt that a person must not worry about being successful but we must work hard towards being significant and success will naturally follow. I also learnt that one must look at all possible scenarios so that when something happens nothing will surprise me. 


From Praise's story  I was inspired and got motivated that I can do anything in this world

Kindly excuse me for the delay in reply. There was some technical discrepancy in my device. 
This is Indeed a wonderful understanding of the Newsletter. I really liked how you have summarized the main points.
26/10/23, 3:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Sharon and parents! 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

Thats my hobby 
I'm also into football

hat's great to hear that you love singing! Music can be such a wonderful way to express yourself and enjoy your hobbies. Is there a specific genre or type of music you enjoy singing the most?

And it's awesome that you're into football as well! Do you have a favorite football team or player you're a fan of? Playing football as a hobby can be a lot of fun. Do you participate in any local matches or just enjoy playing with friends for fun?

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
