I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Sharda your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.
31/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 488 7380: Events like chess tournaments, tennis and marimba as well

I hope you are doing well

It's great to see your diverse range of interests! Chess tournaments can be intellectually stimulating and highly competitive. Have you participated in any chess tournaments, and if so, do you have a favorite game or memorable moment to share?
01/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 488 7380: Yes i have!
A few weeks back i was in our capital city, Harare, for chess nationals. It was a great experience cause there were many schools from different cities...they had different skills and different experiences that got us learning from them. At first it was overwhelming but as time went on i was able to deal with everything
01/11/23, 4:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am really happy to know about this, Priviledge.
And, I have my full faith that you will do great.
01/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 488 7380: Thank you ma'am
03/11/23, 10:12 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Priviledge

07/11/23, 1:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 488 7380: Thank you, ma'am! 
I think the key factors that will help me succeed in my EWYL journey are hard work, consistency, determination, and creativity in a sense that when I'm given a project, i have to be creative and find ways on how i can finish it in a short period of time. For example, if i have a project that includes me interacting with people, i need to find strategies on how to win their attention and convince them to do what i want them to do. Furthermore, creativity goes hand in hand with hard work, consistency, and determination. Without all those 3, is no creativity. Creativity comes with research, setting-up your mind in whatever you're doing and not giving up
07/11/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You're absolutely on the right track! Hard work, consistency, determination, and creativity are indeed key factors for success in your Earn While You Learn journey. Your proactive approach to projects and the ability to think creatively and efficiently will undoubtedly set you apart. Keep up the excellent work and continue to harness these qualities; they will serve you well in your endeavors.
07/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 488 7380: Thank you ma'am!
07/11/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: you are welcome please!
