29/08/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." - Lao Tzu

No matter where you are on your path, remember that every step you take today brings you closer to your goals. Let's make this session a productive and rewarding one together.
03/11/23, 1:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon *Comedy* @263784738512 @263711388046 
I hope you are doing well.

I really hope that you will be available for today's session. 

This is a gentle reminder that you have your EWYL Training session scheduled today from *1:30 pm*.
Please ensure that you are *available for the session on time.*
03/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 138 8046: Good afternoon Ma'am
03/11/23, 1:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello and welcome, *Comedy*! Let's begin this session with a little inspiration: 'The only way to do great work is to love what you do.' So, let's dive in, do what we love, and make this session truly remarkable.

03/11/23, 4:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that the time is over, let us reconveve again after the weekend.
03/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 138 8046: Ok
06/11/23, 12:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Comedy
I trust you are in good health.

I would like to kindly remind you of your *scheduled EWYL Training session today*, commencing at *1:30 pm*. Please ensure that you are *available for the session on time.*
06/11/23, 1:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle." - Christian D. Larson

*Hello, Comedy ! Let's start our session with this empowering quote in mind.*
Are you ready ?
06/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 138 8046: Good evening Ma'am
07/11/23, 1:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Comedy,

Just a quick reminder of our *session today at 01:30 PM*. Be ready to join on time. Excited for our session!
07/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 138 8046: Ok
07/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you available for the session, Comedy?
07/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 138 8046: Yes I am available
07/11/23, 3:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
07/11/23, 3:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
07/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 138 8046: Ok
07/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 138 8046: Yes
07/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
07/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
07/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
07/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
07/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Comedy*, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
07/11/23, 3:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will definitely help you out.
07/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 138 8046: Ohhh olk
07/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 138 8046: ......

EDOOFA, initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in India, firmly believes that quality education should be accessible to all, irrespective of social or financial limitations. This exceptional scholarship program addresses the challenges of affordability and employability in higher education through its unique work-study model.
07/11/23, 3:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs.

Collaborating with over 100 schools, including partnerships with esteemed educational leaders such as Mr. Shorwi Kawadza, Principal of Hartzell High School, Mutare, EDOOFA has witnessed the success of more than 80 students who have already embarked on their journey to study in India.
07/11/23, 3:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

07/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 138 8046: Yes
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
07/11/23, 4:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
