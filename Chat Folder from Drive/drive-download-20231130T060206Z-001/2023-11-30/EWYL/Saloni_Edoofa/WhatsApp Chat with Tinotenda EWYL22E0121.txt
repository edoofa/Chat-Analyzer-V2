26/09/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 403 7217: Sorry Mam
26/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 403 7217: Afternoon mam  can you explain to us because we don't no anything about the money
26/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 403 7217: About the $300
26/09/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now onwards, for every form that Tinotenda will share, he will get:

$75 if the referred student pays partial enrolment fees of $200
$25 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of the remaining $150
So, basically, $100 if the referred student pays complete enrollment
$100 if the referred student pays complete registration fees
$100 if the referred student comes to India.
26/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 403 7217: Oky Mam is this money goes to Tinotenda's hands or you pay her fees
26/09/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This amount can be adjusted in her fees only if she earns any.
26/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 403 7217: Oky Mam we do understood thank you
26/09/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great!
26/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 403 7217: My understanding is that If Tinotenda shared a form she will get $75  and the student get enrolled she get $25 and if the referred student  pays complete enrollment, Tinotenda get $100 and the referred student goes to India, Tinotenda get another $100  to make it $300 that's my understanding Mam
26/09/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, you have got it!
26/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 403 7217: Thank you mam so give Tinotenda more forms so that we can help her to distribute the forms

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

15/11/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

25/11/23, 6:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello my Proud Edoofian, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
