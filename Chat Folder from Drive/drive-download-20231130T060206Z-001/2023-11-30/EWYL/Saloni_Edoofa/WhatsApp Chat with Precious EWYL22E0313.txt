Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.

Your journey has been really transforming. Back when you were in Zimbabwe, we talked about projects in our sessions rigorously. Your hard work, passion, and dedication also helped you fetch other projects like Social Media, Community Relationship management, and whatnot. Your diligence and smart ideas always stole the show and therefore you got the grant as well at the meet and greet event. Both of us, you and me, maintained a lovely relationship, and hence this journey was not more than a dream come true for many.

Now, I want you to inspire others as well through your journey on how you have ended up earning more than $250 so far and you aspire to earn more and work hard like you used to do.

In the write you can talk about introducing yourself, how you started with your EWYL Journey, your biggest contributors, how you worked, challenges, and how you overcame all of them

I want you to prepare this write by tonight and share it with me, really excited🌟🌈
02/09/23, 10:53 am - +91 84275 06957: Wow I'm so happy about this Mam🤭

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

18/10/23, 11:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Precious!
How are you?
18/10/23, 11:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Did you consult the medical team at LPU?
19/10/23, 5:44 pm - +91 84275 06957: Not yet Mam
19/10/23, 5:45 pm - +91 84275 06957: Because money is required at the medical Lpu team so I don't have money for now
19/10/23, 8:10 pm - +27 62 833 9840: This message was deleted
20/10/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Precious!
How are you?
20/10/23, 8:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: What I know from the team is that medical consultation is free there, yes medicines will not be free but at least you can ask them wat is going on to you health.
20/10/23, 8:47 am - +91 84275 06957: Thank you Mam,I will surely go tomorrow because today I haven't managed to go to college

20/10/23, 8:52 am - +91 84275 06957: Thank you Mam ☺️
20/10/23, 9:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: @27628339840 Precious was given an amazing opportunity a month ago and she was asked to get you over the conversation here but I saw no response so I thought to personally reach out to you.
20/10/23, 9:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: As part of the community-building project, the students have the opportunity to share their Edoofa journey with their peers, neighbors, classmates, relatives, and cousins. They can introduce them to what Edoofa is, and how it can benefit them, and share your own inspiring story. If they show interest, you can provide them with a student application form, and once they've filled it out, share their forms with me. Your enthusiasm and willingness to help others embark on a similar path are truly commendable. 🌟🌍📚
20/10/23, 9:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: In the past, for the community building project, the student earned a total scholarship credit of $50. But now, we're excited to offer you an opportunity to earn not just $100, not even $200, but an impressive $300 for each student application form you submit to us!
20/10/23, 9:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here's the breakdown of this incredible $300 opportunity:
 You'll receive $75 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of $200.
 An additional $25 will be yours if the referred student pays the remaining $150 as partial enrollment fees.
1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
20/10/23, 9:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what you feel about this opportunity given to Precious?
20/10/23, 9:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: @27628339840
20/10/23, 12:27 pm - +27 62 833 9840: Your plans and visions are 100% good, so Precious is supposed to use these opportunities  as soon as possible

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 4:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

c) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

27/11/23, 3:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You know Precious, personally I don't even believe my eyes what has happened to you. You know when you arrived in India, and I went to the airport to receive you, I had a 101-degree fever. Ms. Deepali clearly said that if you wish to rest that day, you can not exert yourself in traveling since my house is like 2 hours away from the airport. I said to her that no, I would be going since my best student would be coming and I promised her way that I would be coming to receive her. I had so many expectations from you Precious and I thought that we could be a good team and you would outshine yourself but the reverse happened. You performed really poorly, missed all my calls and EWYL Group sessions, and constantly your name started getting highlighted in the Defaulters List. Now at this moment Precious, I really regret having so much trust over you.
27/11/23, 4:00 pm - +91 84275 06957: No Mam it's like I have been facing so many challenges even up to now I'm still facing

27/11/23, 4:02 pm - +91 84275 06957: So it has been distracting me each and everyday ,I have confusion now wether I'm going to be in India until I finish my coarse or I will return back home
27/11/23, 4:03 pm - +91 84275 06957: My Daddy is not feeling well at the moment and is in hospital for the past 2 months now,he is my only sponser
27/11/23, 4:04 pm - +91 84275 06957: So all these things happening in my life are making me confused of how life in India is going to be for me for the years to come
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - +91 84275 06957: I still have pending fee for first semester and have been blocked and being unblocked and all this is something that is stressing
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - +91 84275 06957: My HOD said that since I have worked for Edoofa in bringing some students to LPU i should show them the certificate I got from Edoofa so that I may receive help on my tuition from the school,that's why I was pleading for the certificate because it's needed as early as possible
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - +91 84275 06957: If I don't get any help from school this is going to lead to me returning back home
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - +91 84275 06957: So all these challenges Mam are bringing me down 🥹and to attend the sessions i really want but sometimes im too stressed to the highest extend

This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
28/11/23, 2:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 84275 06957: Yes I remember but it was $300 annually
28/11/23, 2:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent Precious, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
28/11/23, 2:44 pm - +91 84275 06957: Making sure to attend sessions
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - +91 84275 06957: Also uuum doing everything that is expected of a proud edoofian to do
28/11/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,
28/11/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
28/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 84275 06957: Olk Mam
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
28/11/23, 2:53 pm - +91 84275 06957: That's amazing Mam
28/11/23, 2:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
28/11/23, 2:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
28/11/23, 2:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:

28/11/23, 3:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you have any pending fees as of October 2023, but you have cleared it.
28/11/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
28/11/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 84275 06957: Yes
28/11/23, 3:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it

28/11/23, 3:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: But you won't be able to make use of it since you are not eligible for the grant.
28/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 84275 06957: It doesn't matter
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 84275 06957: I just want to show it as proof that I'm an edoofian
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 84275 06957: The school will only help me with my fee when they see this proof
