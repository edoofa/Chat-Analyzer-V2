You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

22/08/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Infomed over the call.
22/08/23, 3:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Shantel, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. (already done)

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.
22/08/23, 3:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 3:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: A handwritten letter can be something like this (this is just a sample for you, don't copy-paste anything)
The letter has to be completely based on your personal experience
22/08/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 918 0886: Noted with thanks
22/08/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 918 0886: As per our discussion on the video call, l understood that the 300 usd plan will be attained through community building project where by l will be advertising the edoofa scholarship program and submit the application forms for the gathered students. Upon completion of the first part of the enrolment fee payment by the student, l will be getting a 75usd credit, 25usd upon completion of the second payment of the admission fee and thus if the student decides to pay in two installments and when the student decides to pay the whole fee at once, l will be getting a 100 usd scholarship credit at once.

Upon completing of the admission fee to the chosen school, l will be getting another 100usd  scholarship credit and l would also be earning another 100usd scholarship credit upon the student's arrival to India.

2. How Edoofa can benefit them?
3. Why are they filling out the student application form?
4. Are they aware of your journey?

However, since your arrival, I've noticed a dip in your engagement and participation, which has given me pause. I'd love to understand the challenges you're currently facing so that I can provide the necessary support to help you overcome them. Your success is still very much within reach, and we're here to make sure you excel! 🚀🤝
18/10/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As our session comes to an end, I want you to know that I'm genuinely grateful for the connection we've shared.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 3:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Shantel, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*🏆
15/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 918 0886: Okay ma'am
15/11/23, 3:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also Shantel, how are you working on the $300 plan?
15/11/23, 4:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

23/11/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $250 annually. 
Do you remember this?
23/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 918 0886: Yes ma'am I remember
23/11/23, 2:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great, Can you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? To make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy those guidelines obediently. 
Can you recall what they were?
23/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 918 0886: Yes
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share the same with me?
23/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 918 0886: One was supposed to share at least 10 forms     of the students that want to be enrolled into the program, one had to share the "l am a proud edoofian" mantra for 21 days and actively participate in the EWYL Line. One had to recite the mantra as a way of marking their attendance for the day, during the 21 day grant challenge and in order for one to redeem the grant one has to have at least 75% participation in the EWYL line and the grant is said to be only released in the even semesters
23/11/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share that with you for better clarity.
23/11/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
23/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 918 0886: Okay
23/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 918 0886: I remember
23/11/23, 3:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Over the last few months, we've been checking how well you're doing. We've been keeping an eye on whether you're showing up for our weekly calls, and webinars, and completing the tasks I've given you, like submitting reviews, usernames, testimonial videos, and so on.
23/11/23, 3:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*
23/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 918 0886: Following
23/11/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75%.

But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.
