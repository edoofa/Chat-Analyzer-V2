16/08/23, 1:34 pm - +260 96 8492349: Yes please
16/08/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
16/08/23, 1:45 pm - +260 96 8492349: Yes please
16/08/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
16/08/23, 1:47 pm - +260 96 8492349: @260965393861  is my father and @260977393869  is my mother
16/08/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to welcome you to the group, I am sure you will welcome tremendous growth and splendid transition in Subilo as we move ahead in this journey🚀
16/08/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Subilo, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
16/08/23, 1:54 pm - +260 96 8492349: Long term goals I just have to attain my careers of choice
16/08/23, 1:54 pm - +260 96 8492349: I feel the EWYL program will help look at it vast
16/08/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That's great, I am happy to hear this idea⚡
16/08/23, 2:00 pm - +260 96 8492349: Surely
16/08/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/08/23, 2:01 pm - +260 96 8492349: You might as well explain them
16/08/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
16/08/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
16/08/23, 2:09 pm - +260 96 8492349: I highly understand now
16/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.

23/08/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​

How did you get in touch with the contact person?
23/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.

28/08/23, 2:11 pm - +260 96 8492349: How lovely it is!
28/08/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
28/08/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/08/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
28/08/23, 2:22 pm - +260 96 8492349: Noted!
28/08/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/08/23, 2:22 pm - +260 96 8492349: Alright
28/08/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Subilo/Saloni/28AUG2023*
28/08/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/08/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
28/08/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
28/08/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/08/23, 2:23 pm - +260 96 8492349: Great
29/08/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

29/08/23, 1:49 pm - +260 96 8492349: I tried to engage a few but most have other

29/08/23, 2:27 pm - +260 96 8492349: The names?
29/08/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No like which category of students did you approach, like school groups, Facebook groups?
29/08/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I'll see you on *Thursday* from 01:30-02:30 PM since the organization will remain closed on the occasion of our Indian festival _Raksha Bandhan_�

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.
29/08/23, 2:48 pm - +260 96 8492349: Ohh just school groups
29/08/23, 2:48 pm - +260 96 8492349: Alright, have a great day
31/08/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_

31/08/23, 3:47 pm - +260 96 8492349: Alright, have a blessed day
01/09/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

01/09/23, 2:34 pm - +260 96 8492349: Ms Saloni, so On Monday the 4th, I'll be opening school and I'm not allowed to carry a phone
01/09/23, 2:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
01/09/23, 2:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:

16/09/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Saturday* from *08:00 AM - 09:30 AM* from next week onwards⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 11:41 am - +260 96 5393861: Well noted
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day! I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that due to the _organization being closed this Saturday_, our next session will be rescheduled to the following week, specifically on *Wednesday, September 27, 2023* _12:00-01:00 PM_. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you see the video, do let me know how you find it and of course, pick out your best section from the newsletter. Excited to hear that out!

27/09/23, 12:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you saw the video and the newsletter that were shared in the last week?
27/09/23, 12:45 pm - +260 96 5393861: Yes the news letter and the video was received and watched.
27/09/23, 12:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!
27/09/23, 12:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Subilo can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
27/09/23, 12:53 pm - +260 96 5393861: Same page indeed and following
27/09/23, 12:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
27/09/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
27/09/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
27/09/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
27/09/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
27/09/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

I will not begin anything before she herself is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
28/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.

17/10/23, 10:23 am - +260 96 5393861: - [ ] This week’s newsletter was a great reminder to both the parents and students towards acknowledging and working hard to achieve their dreams and goals
- [ ] It spoke greatly about working towards something significantly.Defining and understanding your life goals/dreams will help you find a better approach in becoming successful 
- [ ] Working hard is a vita role in our career chasing; there is competition and everyone is striving to win. So let your hard work be an exceptional from the rest and success will naturally follow 
- [ ] Also in accordance with Henry Ford’s beliefs “ providing values before seeking value is a wise approach, “ knowing your principles and resources is a great value in accomplishing what you desire because it tells more about you and how you will walk the path towards the goal 
- [ ] And lastly it urged us that the only limit is yourself, you can be anything and can achieve anything. Take the risk, dream big and strive in achieving your goals

How are you doing?

This week in India we celebrated _Dussehra, also known as Vijayadashami_, which is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India. It signifies the *victory of good over evil* and marks the end of the nine-day Navaratri festival. Dussehra honors the legend of *Lord Rama's triumph over the demon king Ravana*👺, symbolizing the victory of righteousness and truth. It is celebrated with grand processions, cultural events, and the burning of effigies of Ravana, signifying the defeat of negativity. Dussehra also emphasizes the importance of moral values and the need to stand up against injustice, making it a significant cultural celebration in India.🇮🇳
26/10/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Dussehra, although not originally linked to Zambia, has found relevance in the country through the Indian diaspora. Zambia is a country with a rich tapestry of cultures and traditions, which is reflected in the variety of festivals celebrated throughout the year. Among the most prominent is *Independence Day,* commemorating Zambia's independence from British colonial rule on October 24th. *Labour Day* on May 1st is also celebrated with parades and events to honor the country's workers. Additionally, Agricultural Shows are held across the country, showcasing Zambia's agricultural heritage. Various ethnic groups in Zambia, such as the Bemba, Tonga, and Ngoni, celebrate their own cultural festivals, including ceremonies and rituals that highlight their unique heritage.
26/10/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *So tell me, what are your thoughts on these similarities🫱🏻‍🫲🏼?*
26/10/23, 3:37 pm - +260 96 5393861: - [ ] They all highlight and commemorates the core values that formulate the community and way of life
- [ ] They are all festivals that reminds us of past events and reflect a strong belief of culture 
- [ ] They all give us time to commemorate past events and appreciate the people who took a strong led in reforming these festival celebrations
- [ ] They are all are period that help people understand more of their cultural heritage and preserve it
27/10/23, 12:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!

That is great, I am so delighted to have your views on it🌟
I think Zimbabwe and India, despite their geographical and cultural differences, share certain similarities in their festive traditions. Both countries celebrate major festivals with vibrant colors, music, and a strong sense of community. Both nations also celebrate various agricultural festivals, reflecting the importance of farming in their societies. Additionally, the idea of family and community bonding is central to both countries' celebrations, emphasizing the significance of togetherness during these festive occasions.
01/11/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning, esteemed and proud Edoofians parents!
