You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?
04/08/23, 7:38 pm - +263 78 437 2336: Greetings to you ma'am. I apologise my network was poor

05/08/23, 6:12 am - +263 78 437 2336: When I went to apply for my visa l was told that l had insufficient balance in my balance in my account. In my bank statement there was 750 balance, you had told us to have 500 in our account however the people from the embassy wanted a bank statement with 1200. I was aaked to come with a bank statement with 1200 today as it was my visa collection day however I failed because my father wasn't around to collect the bank statement.

As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations.

I hope you all are in great health and spirits. Since you were not able to attend/complete the last Grant Session, I have scheduled one other session for the Grant discussion. 🎓
There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 24-08-2023 at -
_*2:30 pm (Zimb time) / 6:00 pm (Indian Time)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want you to read the Grant Letter that was shared with me along with the FAQ document. Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
*No more sessions will be held after this.*
24/08/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 437 2336: Okay ma'am
24/08/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 437 2336: Good afternoon
24/08/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 437 2336: Good evening maam
24/08/23, 2:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, 
I hope you all are perfectly fine. First of all, I want you to share your understanding of the Grant Letter and the FAQ. I want you to know what you have understood from it.
24/08/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 437 2336: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good, Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
24/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 437 2336: Yes ma'am
24/08/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
24/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 437 2336: Thank you ma'am
24/08/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
24/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 437 2336: I participated in the grant challenge
24/08/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
24/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 437 2336: Okay
24/08/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 437 2336: Thank you
24/08/23, 3:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
24/08/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 437 2336: Thank you ma'am
24/08/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the next semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
24/08/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 437 2336: Okay ma'am
24/08/23, 3:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

25/11/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_
I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL
