03/08/23, 8:08 am - +27 76 148 2525: Good morning, will be available.
03/08/23, 8:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: How are you doing Charleen?
03/08/23, 8:32 am - +27 76 148 2525: I am doing good thanks and yourself Ma’am ?
03/08/23, 8:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am good Charleen. Thank you for asking
03/08/23, 8:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So have you gone through the newsletter?
03/08/23, 8:35 am - +27 76 148 2525: Yea I have
03/08/23, 8:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
03/08/23, 8:44 am - +27 76 148 2525: From the first Newsletter I liked the first quote which told us how expensive our days are and how we should use them wisely as you can regret some of the things you did and did not do .
I also learnt from the Edoofian  Nkosilamusa that we shouldn’t underrate religious groups cause the build us to be better people and we learn how to live with others and also leadership.

From the second news letter I loved the 3rd quote which mentioned that they is no secretly success as it is hard work . You need to sweat in order to succeed . As no Pain no Gain . I also like the testimony from the Edoofian Holiness when she stated that things happen for a reason and that if you are not chosen to be a leader they is something else waiting for you .
03/08/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: This is great. I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
03/08/23, 9:07 am - +27 76 148 2525: Yes it is Great
03/08/23, 9:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, It is time to conclude the session here. 🌟

29/08/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Charleen, 
How are you?
29/08/23, 9:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

Through work of social media it is possible to grown our community. A secondary student doing their last year is a target as they are looking forward to their future therefore sharing such as opportunity would be great and educating them about Edoofa and persuading them .

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
01/09/23, 2:36 pm - +27 76 148 2525: Okay
01/09/23, 2:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
01/09/23, 2:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 3:09 pm - +27 76 148 2525: As part of community building. I can create a group chat whereby I add students who are in upper 6 or doing their last high school year for which I’ll be telling them about how they can pursue their education on scholarship and preparing their future . I will address all questions given by the students and make sure all information is shared and understood .
01/09/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Charleen, I am impressed with your understanding.
01/09/23, 3:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
01/09/23, 3:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
