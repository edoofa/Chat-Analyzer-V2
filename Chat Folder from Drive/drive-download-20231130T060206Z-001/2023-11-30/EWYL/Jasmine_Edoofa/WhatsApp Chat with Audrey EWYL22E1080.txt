15/09/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 510 8655: Good morning
15/09/23, 9:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:55 am - +263 71 510 8655: Noted,but Audrey still is not available or active on WhatsApp since they are not allowed to use phones whilst at school.So not sure we as parents can we proceed on her behalf?

25/09/23, 2:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Audrey can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
25/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Ok noted
25/09/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if Audrey is available. If no then, 
1. Either you put your program on hold for now and resume after you have completed your exams
2. Follow the new timetable of meeting me twice a week. 
May I know which one you choose?
25/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Option 2 I think is best.
25/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 510 8655: Audrey not available but will chose option 2.
25/09/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Well since you are planning to choose option 2. I am happy to see that you will be participating but I would suggest you to put the program on hold since lessons and activities are for Audrey, After going through the lessons, he is expected to have a discussion with me. 
Also, I will be explaining all the three projects. Will you be able to participate in the sessions?
25/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 510 8655: If it's best for to be available we can put the program on hold till she finishes her exams which are around the corner.

17/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 510 8655: Good morning here is my response
1 I agree with Henry Ford's belief that of providing value before seeking value as a wise approach.If one provide value  in whatever we wish to embark on obviously you get recognition,quality products,superb results etc
17/10/23, 11:33 am - +263 71 510 8655: 2 The results that one can get from such a principle include fame,success,rewards, winning in completion because of the value earlier on one has put.Nothing beats quality.

26/10/23, 3:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good morning_*, I trust you're doing well. 

Today, I'd like to share some insights about *Dussehra, a festival observed in India on the 24th of October* Dussehra marks the triumph of Lord Rama, an embodiment of the deity Vishnu, over the demon king Ravana. As per the epic Ramayana, Ravana had kidnapped Lord Rama's wife, Sita. This festival signifies the victory of righteousness (Rama) over malevolence (Ravana). Allow me to describe how I personally celebrated Dussehra.
