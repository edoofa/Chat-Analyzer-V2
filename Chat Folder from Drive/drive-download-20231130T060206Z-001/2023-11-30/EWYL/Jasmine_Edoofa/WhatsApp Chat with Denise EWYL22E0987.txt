23/08/23, 4:27 pm - +260 97 7895493: This upward adjustment is interesting and very welcome. And as we chatted,  it took me back to the school that she was trying to connect to the officials at Edoofa... has the link been established,  because,  it was left hanging on the part of Edoofa... There was to be a meeting with the school administration which had not been done.
23/08/23, 4:29 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am so sorry but I did not understand the link you are asking about.
23/08/23, 4:41 pm - +260 97 6293983: I shared a form filled out by a school some time back and they said they'd schedule a meeting with the headteacher
23/08/23, 4:42 pm - +260 97 6293983: I didn't ask to find out if that happened but It turns out it didn't
23/08/23, 4:51 pm - +260 97 7895493: On community building,  instead of just targeting students,  there was a part that encouraged linking schools to Edoofa to enable   students that want to study abroad have easy access with the help of the sch.
She sold the idea with the school admin and  they embraced it very well , she also informed the people concerned (Edoofa)to schedule a meeting with the school. 
This too had points attached to it.
23/08/23, 5:03 pm - +260 97 7895493: And on this exercise,  is there a way of creating a link to trace every person and school linked to Edoofa back to Denise as their referral when when they get to learn about it from her?
23/08/23, 5:10 pm - +260 97 6293983: Not unless they use a form presented by me that I'll send to my mentor
23/08/23, 5:10 pm - +260 97 6293983: They shouldnt use any link
23/08/23, 5:13 pm - +260 97 7895493: Noted... ✅
24/08/23, 7:53 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
I hope everyone is well.
24/08/23, 7:53 am - +91 78273 08969: Denise, Please share the form again and I will check on that.

24/08/23, 8:18 am - +260 97 7895493: This is understood but they're times when information and the form is given to a would be Edoofian  but for some reason, they doubt the process and go quiet... after   some months , you get to learn that they're  on board and having sessions with counselors or preparing for their travel without having sent back the offline form . 
That is why I asked if they could be a link to trace you back to the person that first shared the information with you. 
** The forms too can have that provision of the referrals' details at the bottom. 
 My thoughts.
24/08/23, 8:19 am - +260 97 7895493: Have a blessed day.
24/08/23, 8:29 am - +91 78273 08969: I can understand your concern but even if the student gets on board after several months and gets enrolled you will get the credits.

29/09/23, 1:28 pm - +91 78273 08969: Dear Denise,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Jasmine your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Jasmine's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

04/10/23, 9:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Denise🍂

I hope this message finds you well and in high spirits. It is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I introduce myself as your new mentor, *Ms. Jasmine.* I am genuinely excited to embark on this journey with you and assist you in reaching new heights as we strive to earn the maximum scholarship credits along with some extraordinary skills from the EWYL program.
So, first of all, I would like to know how are you doing?
04/10/23, 9:44 am - +260 97 6293983: Good afternoon Ms Jasmine ...
I'm looking forward to embark on this journey with you too, I'm hoping it will be a wonderful journey.
04/10/23, 9:45 am - +260 97 6293983: I'm doing well thank you
And how are you?
04/10/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊 I am so glad that we are not completely strangers because I clearly remember meeting you at GGI.
04/10/23, 10:00 am - +260 97 6293983: I'm so glad you're my mentor
Because you're the only one who made me feel comfortable that day
04/10/23, 10:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am so touched to hear that Denise. You know I especially asked Ms. Tenzin to give your responsibility to me.
04/10/23, 10:05 am - +260 97 6293983: 🤭🫶🏾
04/10/23, 10:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now, allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program. 
I am dropping a video below. Do have a look at it.
04/10/23, 10:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 10:10 am - +260 97 6293983: The network is quite slow
I will be back after my lesson to watch it
04/10/23, 10:10 am - +260 97 6293983: See you then
04/10/23, 10:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Denise

04/10/23, 12:32 pm - +260 97 6293983: I really do hope we'll be connected for the longest period because I've already had two changes in mentors 😅
04/10/23, 12:32 pm - +260 97 6293983: Thank you
04/10/23, 12:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, dear. Don't worry about that. So tell me how was your day?
04/10/23, 12:40 pm - +260 97 6293983: Tiring as usual
Just came back from a three hour workshop
My timetable is always packed
04/10/23, 12:41 pm - +260 97 6293983: But I'm getting used to it
Slowly but surely
04/10/23, 12:41 pm - +260 97 6293983: Actually starting to enjoy it
04/10/23, 12:41 pm - +260 97 6293983: How was yours?
04/10/23, 12:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: My day is going good. I have been taking sessions since morning. Denise, If you have time, then I would first love to know you as a person.
04/10/23, 12:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have always heard, first from Mr. Maurice and then from Ms. Tenzin, that Denise is someone who talks a lot and has a lot of questions all the time. How true is this?
04/10/23, 12:44 pm - +260 97 6293983: 😂😂😂
04/10/23, 12:45 pm - +260 97 6293983: It's very true
Once I get comfortable enough
I'm quite inquisitive
Even my teachers know I have questions even when I don't raise my hand
04/10/23, 12:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That's interesting. So, why were you so quite at the orientation?
04/10/23, 12:47 pm - +260 97 6293983: I was uncomfortable
I felt out of place
And I didn't like that ms Tenzin got my hopes up and didn't think to tell me in advance that she wasn't coming
04/10/23, 12:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It was a sudden change of plan Denise. She was aware that you would be hurt and this is why she especially told me to meet you and hug you. You know some things are not in our hand but we have to adjust.
04/10/23, 12:53 pm - +260 97 6293983: I understood that
And it meant a lot to me that she asked you to hug me
And that you made the effort to talk to me even though I was so quiet
I guess I just don't do well with sudden changes and I was processing it
04/10/23, 12:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I'm really glad to hear that you understood and appreciated the gestures made during that moment. Now, if you ever need someone to talk to or if you have any questions or concerns about anything, don't hesitate to reach out.
04/10/23, 12:59 pm - +260 97 6293983: I won't
Thank you 🫶🏾
04/10/23, 1:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Denise, Right now I have one pre- scheduled session. I hope you will understand.
12/10/23, 9:01 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Dear Denise_*,
I hope this message finds you well. As your mentor, I understand the challenges you face with classes, tests, and assignments that can make our meetings difficult.

To provide more flexibility:

12/10/23, 9:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it more clear -
*First Week*: Call on Saturday 
*Next Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday
*Next Week*: Call on Saturday and so on.

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile. I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

08/11/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I trust you're doing well. Although it's a bit late, there's crucial information I need to share with you.

I hope you remember that you were granted Scholarship Grant 2023 by Mr. Angad during his meet and greet in Africa.

*Tomorrow, on the 23rd of November 2023, I've scheduled a session from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm.* We'll have a comprehensive discussion about the grant during this time. Please ensure you don't miss it. Wishing you a restful Goodnight.
22/11/23, 8:45 pm - +260 97 6293983: Good evening
Thank you 
Have a good night

23/11/23, 12:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*
I'd like to remind you about your session today for the Grant discussion. 
Before joining the session, kindly take a moment to review the Grant letter that I'll be sharing below.
23/11/23, 12:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - +260 97 6293983: Good evening
23/11/23, 4:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening, 
I am delighted to discuss with you the proceedings of the grant, the one that you received from our esteemed founders, Mr. Angad Singh & Mr. Avreen Singh during their visit to Zambia. I hope you recall the event that I am talking about.
23/11/23, 4:22 pm - +260 97 6293983: Yes I do
Very well! It was incredible
23/11/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me start this session by asking you about the importance and understanding of the Grant. So are you ready?
23/11/23, 4:24 pm - +260 97 6293983: yes please <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 4:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess the remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
23/11/23, 4:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
23/11/23, 4:36 pm - +260 97 6293983: Understood 🤔
23/11/23, 5:12 pm - +260 97 7895493: Good evening Ms Jasmine.  I hope you have had a fruitful day. 
Could you shade more light on the grant guideline number 6.
