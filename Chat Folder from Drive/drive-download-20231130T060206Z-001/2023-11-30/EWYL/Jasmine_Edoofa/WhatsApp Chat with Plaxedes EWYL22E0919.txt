Yes, Indeed. It's delightful to hear that Plaxedes will be available from today evening up to Sunday. According to me, I don't think that coming to the sessions with me on and off will bear any fruitful results. 
Could you kindly tell me that when Plaxedes will be available for straight 15 days?

29/08/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 679 8904: Okay maam enjoy and make sure to share love with your beloved ones😚

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.

31/08/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.

For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*
31/08/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 679 8904: Yah that will help.a.lot
31/08/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
31/08/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 679 8904: Okay maam

31/08/23, 9:14 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Job*, Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.
31/08/23, 9:14 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 9:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 679 8904: Thank you very much let me look at them
31/08/23, 9:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: We've covered the fundamentals of the program, the key team members, and the program structure in today's session. Please review the newsletters we discussed today and we'll pick up from where we left off tomorrow. Before we end, I'd like to recognize your active participation, which has added value to our conversation. Our next session is at 08:30 am tomorrow, so please be on time.✨ 
Have a great day ahead.
31/08/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 679 8904: Have a great day thank you very much
01/09/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning,

01/09/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the inconvenience caused, but I must request your understanding for today. We have scheduled visits to several universities in the coming days, and an unexpected urgent meeting has arisen that requires my immediate attention. I assure you that we will make up for the missed session during our next meeting, which is scheduled for *Monday at 8:30 a.m.*

Until then, please take good care, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend ahead.
01/09/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Okay but l will already be at school by then

04/09/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Plaxedes
Okay, Plaxedes. As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to send a mail on to me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because  _  from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Jasmine as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - ewyl@edoofa.com, and jasmine.edoofa@gmail.com.

 Once you are done, kindly let me know so that I can confirm.
04/09/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Okay maam
15/09/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 690 6202: Good morning Ms Jasmine
I think option 1 can do
15/09/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, May I know the time.
16/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 690 6202: 1300-1400 hours

07/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Yes maam
07/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Let's proceed
07/10/23, 3:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
07/10/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Thank you
07/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Nice to know you miss Jasmine
07/10/23, 3:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
07/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 679 8904: I think is to earn while you earn
07/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Helping my parents with the fees
07/10/23, 3:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
07/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Yah thanks for  the enlightenment maam
07/10/23, 3:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
07/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Okay so if l will be working the money will be going to the university straight ryt
07/10/23, 3:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Plaxedes
07/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Okay now l understand
07/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Which one is our last step
07/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Next l.mean
07/10/23, 3:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What Plaxedes?
07/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 679 8904: I mean after the EWYL which one is our next step
07/10/23, 3:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Plaxedes, EWYL is itself the last step. Under the EWYL program, a student is expected to do projects and earn Scholarship credits in return.
07/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 679 8904: So the project l will be doing it here in Zimbabwe or there in India
07/10/23, 3:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You can start working on the projects while you are there in Zimbabwe and then continue while you are in India. 

The main advantage is that when you start working on the projects while you are there in Zimbabwe, you can actually earn scholarship credits and come to India with all your fees already earned.
07/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Which types of project  are required
07/10/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I will let you know about them ina  while
07/10/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Shall we proceed?
07/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Yes maam
07/10/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 

Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
07/10/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
07/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Okay l will talk to her maam we will be in touch
07/10/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
07/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Thank you
07/10/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates you to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days. <This message was edited>
07/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Okay l will   be intouch  with you
07/10/23, 3:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them after the session and let me know once you have read them.

07/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Thank you
07/10/23, 3:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. Will that be okay?
07/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 679 8904: Yes lm okay with it

How are you doing today? You know, while I was traveling to the office today, I thought that we were already late to begin our EWYL journey and work on the project, as you were occupied with your exams. So, I was thinking of connecting on a daily basis here in your EWYL group.

This way, I can ensure proper guidance and an effective path to work on your project, maximizing scholarship credits. *Therefore, from now on, let us connect at 1:30 pm in the afternoon in your EWYL group to proceed with your EWYL journey*!
