As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️

29/08/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

I hope this message finds you well. As your mentor, I understand the challenges you face with classes, tests, and assignments that can make our meetings difficult.

To provide more flexibility:
*1. We will now have our video calls on alternate Saturdays.*

09/10/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it more clear -
*First Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday 
*Next Week*: Call on Saturday 
*Next Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday and so on.

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile. I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
09/10/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know is the schedule is crystal clear to you. If not, feel free to discuss.
09/10/23, 4:29 pm - +260 95 7285931: Good evening
It is clear, thank you.
10/10/23, 2:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, ⭐
_*SESSION TIME FOR TOMORROW here on the EWYL GROUP- 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm*_
Make sure you are present and please acknowledge your availability.
11/10/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let's begin our session for today. First, kindly respond to the following questions with either "Yes" or "No":

1. Have you shared your photograph with me?
2. Have you provided your Facebook username?
3. Have you shared your Instagram username?
4. Have you written a review on Google and shared the screenshot with me?
5 Have you written a review on Facebook and shared the screenshot with me?
6. Have you shared your date of birth with me?
11/10/23, 3:25 pm - +260 95 7285931: 1.Yes
2.Yes
3.Yes
4.Yes
5.Yes
6.Yes
11/10/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now, I'd like to discuss our "Star of the Month" initiative, which is our $300 plan. Let me clarify why we introduced this plan. It's designed to help you achieve maximum results with minimal effort. 

However, it's crucial to use your smart strategies when reaching out to students. Are you employing effective tactics maximizing the potential of this plan and using smart methods to make the most out of this plan?
11/10/23, 3:31 pm - +260 95 7285931: Yes.
11/10/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us don't have a good understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, we expect that the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
11/10/23, 3:33 pm - +260 95 7285931: Yes I do.
11/10/23, 3:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 3:39 pm - +260 95 7285931: Yes we are.
11/10/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, the purpose behind creating this video is to ensure that you provide accurate and precise information to the students. Once you submit the video to me, I'll review and approve it. After that, you can share your video with the students. Does this clarify things for you?
11/10/23, 3:41 pm - +260 95 7285931: Yes it does.
11/10/23, 3:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 13-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Friday. Will you be able to do that?
11/10/23, 4:00 pm - +260 95 7285931: I will not manage to do it this week.....most likely net week.
11/10/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, it was wonderful talking to you. I hope you had a good time as well. I truly value your active participation. I'll be in touch soon, and I wish you the best of luck with your exams. <This message was edited>

23/11/23, 3:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, champion! 

I am delighted to discuss with you the proceedings of the grant, the one that you received from our esteemed founders, Mr. Angad Singh & Mr. Avreen Singh during their visit to Zambia. I hope you recall the event that I am talking about? <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 3:40 pm - +260 95 7285931: Good Evening Ms.Jasmine......yes i do.
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me start this session by asking you about the importance and understanding of the Grant. 
So are you ready?
23/11/23, 3:47 pm - +260 95 7285931: Yes
23/11/23, 3:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead and share
23/11/23, 3:57 pm - +260 95 7285931: According to my own understanding, A grant is a fund or specific amount of money given by an organization to an individual for a special purpose.
23/11/23, 4:00 pm - +260 95 7285931: Grants are important because they help in offering financial support which  contributes to the growth and development of an individual
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
23/11/23, 4:09 pm - +260 95 7285931: Okay....
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago? 

Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you deserving.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
23/11/23, 4:23 pm - +260 95 7285931: Thank you very much........
23/11/23, 4:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
23/11/23, 4:43 pm - +260 95 7285931: Okay....Noted.
23/11/23, 6:50 pm - +260 97 7896120: Good evening. Was caught up in another meeting at work, but tried to follow the proceedings.  Thank you for the information
23/11/23, 7:37 pm - +260 97 7896120: And thank you for dedicating time to take us through the process. Most appreciated.
