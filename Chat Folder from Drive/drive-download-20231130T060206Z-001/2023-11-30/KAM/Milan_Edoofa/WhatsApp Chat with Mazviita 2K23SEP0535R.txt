For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
15/09/23, 5:58 am - +263 71 686 5384: Sorry I fell asleep but yes we may.proceed
15/09/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Mazviita.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

May I know if you are ready to further proceed with the session?
15/09/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Good evening .We are doing alright . Yes we are ready to proceed
15/09/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok I have went through the image
15/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
15/09/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
15/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Very clear Thank you
15/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
15/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
15/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes . Iam following
15/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok I understand
15/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
15/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
15/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 686 5384: After this fee  will there be other costs besides for visa
15/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After the fees, there will be no cost, dear. Apart from The plane ticket and the VISA of course.

15/09/23, 11:39 pm - +263 71 686 5384: I guess there are non
16/09/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 247 6509: If there are any we will definitely ask fo clarification

20/09/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm doing wonderfully, thank you for inquiring. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes I am very ready
20/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
20/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes I managed to watch the videos
20/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
20/09/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes I learnt quite a lot from the videos ,got a better understanding of the whole program and hve also understood that Well l have understood that Edoofa is not just scholarship program rather it is a community per say that helps one to achieve set goal through education
20/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 71 686 5384: I have also come to know that Edoofa is connected to quite a number of schools  as well as university were most Edoofians are enrolled at
20/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
20/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
20/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
20/09/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
20/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes thank you very much we may continue
20/09/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
20/09/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 7:30 PM.
20/09/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

21/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, I have now received it. Awaiting the remaining tasks.
21/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok  noted
21/09/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 686 5384: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 360 8257: Good evening . We all had a blessed afternoon thank you for asking
21/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 686 5384: For the second question this is what I got from my research

The relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development .  An entrepreneur is a person who creates a business in the face of risk and uncertainty , entrepreneurship plays a key role in economic development. It creates new jobs for every member of society since it needs both skilled and unskilled labour, generates wealth, and helps to improve living standards. The innovative ideas and new technologies developed by entrepreneurs can lead to improved productivity and efficiency, which in turn leads to higher incomes and greater prosperity.

 Entrepreneurship also promotes competition, which encourages companies to improve their products and services. This leads to more efficient allocation of resources and increased economic output. In addition, the profits earned by entrepreneurs are often reinvested into the economy, which helps to drive further growth. Entrepreneurship also fosters innovation, as new businesses are more likely to take risks and try new ideas than established companies.  However being an entrepreneur is quite difficult . There are a lot of long hardworking hours , in an economy like Zimbabwe there is uncertainty of investment sometimes this discourages entrepreneurship thus no economic development .
21/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 71 686 5384: For the third question 

GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. It's the set of rules, standards, and practices that govern the preparation of financial statements in the United States. It's designed to ensure that companies' financial statements are prepared consistently and accurately, so that investors and creditors can make informed decisions. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is the organization responsible for establishing and updating GAAP. That is what I understood about GAAP. 

From my understanding GAAP is important because  it helps to ensure that companies' financial statements are prepared consistently, so that investors can compare them and make informed decisions. Secondly , it helps to prevent companies from manipulating their financial statements to mislead investors or creditors. And thirdly, it helps to ensure that companies' financial statements are accurate and reliable. In short, GAAP is essential for maintaining the integrity and transparency of the financial markets.
21/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 686 5384: For the Fourth question 

Accounting standards are a set of rules and guidelines that companies and organizations must follow when preparing their financial statements. 
 
Accounting standards are  mandatory because they're designed to ensure that financial statements are prepared consistently and accurately, and to promote transparency and accountability. The main purpose of accounting standards is to ensure that financial statements are prepared in a way that is fair, clear, and understandable. This allows investors, creditors, and other users of financial statements to make informed decisions.Sure, I'd be happy to talk about the importance of accounting standards. There are a few key reasons why they're so important:
Accounting standards also help  promote consistency and comparability in financial reporting. This allows investors to make  comparisons between companies, and makes it easier to identify trends and patterns theyalso  promote  transparency and accountability thereby  b y following the same set of rules, companies are less likely to manipulate their financial statements to give a false impression of their performance.
21/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 71 686 5384: The Fifth question was my absolute favorite 

 The main difference between accounting and auditing is that accounting is the process of recording, analyzing, and reporting financial information, while auditing is the process of verifying the accuracy and integrity of that information. In other words, accounting focuses on creating financial information, while auditing focuses on checking that information for accuracy.  So basically an auditor oversees the work of the accountant 

 Another key difference is that accounting is an ongoing process, while auditing is usually done periodically, such as once a year. Additionally, accounting is typically performed by the company's own staff, while auditing is often done by an outside, independent firm. One last difference is that accounting involves a wide range of financial information, while auditing focuses specifically on financial statements and related disclosures.
21/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 686 5384: I hope I was able to complete my tasks well
21/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have successfully filled out the online SOP form and answered the questions perfectly. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
21/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Unfortunately I haven't been able to take my O level certificate at school but l have the screenshot from the Zimsec portal

21/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 71 686 5384: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom (Accounting and International Finance) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
21/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes the information is accurate
21/09/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
21/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes iam ready
21/09/23, 10:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, my available hours are coming to an end. We shall connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM for further proceedings of our session. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Thank you Have a great night
22/09/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening.

I hope you are as excited as I am as we are approaching the weekend. Please how are you doing this lovely evening?
22/09/23, 8:15 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Hello there
22/09/23, 8:16 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Iam very excited about the weekend . How was your day
22/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
22/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes I am ready
22/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
22/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
22/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
22/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Oki understand . So for me to receive an offer letter I don't have to wait until my A level results come out ?
22/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed. We can proceed with the early registration process using your A-level statement of entry. Could you confirm if this is clear to you?
22/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Please evaluate further
22/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Maybe telling me about time frames in  terms of particular dates in which the proceedings will take place
22/09/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: am committed to assisting you throughout this process. By maintaining consistent communication in our sessions, we can efficiently progress and aim to reach the discussion about the offer letter within a two-week timeframe. Is this understanding clear and agreeable to you?
22/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes thank you
22/09/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yess we managed to discuss this during our sessions
22/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes i understand all this but my question is will all this be done by the end of this year or early next year ? , Because there are a lot of preparations to be done and as it is right now iam under exam pressure which are starting in Less than a month
22/09/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, please do not worry about that right now. As for the further session, we can also proceed with your parents as well.
22/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok understood thank you
22/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you might be still able to continue the session for now?
22/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes we may continue
22/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
22/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes understood
22/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
22/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
22/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
22/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok okkk noteddd
22/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Understood thank you
22/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
22/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
22/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Okkk I understand that you for enlightening me now a lot is clear
22/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
22/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
22/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
22/09/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
23/09/23, 4:09 am - +263 71 686 5384: Good morning . Please pardon me my battery died during our session .
23/09/23, 4:10 am - +263 71 686 5384: I clearly understand the admission process thank you

25/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 71 686 5384: For now I don't have any questions but is they are any l will definitely ask thank you
25/09/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/09/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
26/09/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
26/09/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Iam very excited thank you🙏
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Woww.
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 686 5384: I can't wait honestly . thank you very much
26/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
26/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
26/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes I am ready
26/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
26/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes I have gone through the benefits we may continue
26/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
26/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Okk I fully understand
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 5:42 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes you explained very well thank you
26/09/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/09/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 6:03 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok I understand but  is there a due date in paying this $750
26/09/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed there is and you wll be well informed about the dates by the time of the payment.
26/09/23, 6:21 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok understood thank you
26/09/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/09/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/09/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/09/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
26/09/23, 6:38 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok thank you I understand
26/09/23, 6:38 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Thank you .be blessed
27/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes thank you . Iam in understanding of how the whole process works
27/09/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/09/23, 4:59 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yesss they won't
27/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/09/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 686 5384: The first 2 are correct however I disagree with the third one
27/09/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The same goes for me. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/09/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes very clear
27/09/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
27/09/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/09/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes understood
27/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/09/23, 5:44 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok okk I understand
27/09/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 5:47 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Mmmm no questions so far
27/09/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
27/09/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes iam very excited about this journey
27/09/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 247 6509: As afamily we are also following the proceedings.Its exciting
27/09/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Mazviita's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
27/09/23, 6:07 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok thank you very much .be blessed
27/09/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
27/09/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 247 6509: Thanks
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Thank you very much.
28/09/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 686 5384: We will do our proper research on the university and get back to you
29/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mazviita!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
29/09/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 360 8257: Good afternoon.We are fine
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. May I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now so that we can discuss the same here?
29/09/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Good evening .
29/09/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 686 5384: We were able to go through the admission letter
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
30/09/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 686 5384: The semester tuition free after the schoolarship is $900 
 The standard duration of my course is 3 years 
The admission and procedure free is $300

The registration fee is $750
30/09/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 686 5384: Good morning hope you are well
30/09/23, 11:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I am doing very well. Now, what you have shared is completely correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
30/09/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 686 5384: Yesss very clear
30/09/23, 11:16 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
30/09/23, 11:16 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
30/09/23, 11:16 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
30/09/23, 11:19 am - +263 71 686 5384: Ok I will
30/09/23, 11:19 am - +263 71 686 5384: Ok I understand
30/09/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
30/09/23, 11:20 am - +263 71 686 5384: Yes we are together
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
03/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Afternoon we are all well
03/10/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 686 5384: We understand
03/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes we may proceed
03/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
03/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes clear
03/10/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
03/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yesss
03/10/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
03/10/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
03/10/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
03/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yessss we understand
03/10/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/10/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 686 5384: No I reside in Gweru
03/10/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/10/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/10/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes we understand however as a family we feel that the dates are too soon and the money is difficult to arrange in such a short period
03/10/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, the dates mentioned are as per the offer letter itself, and according to what you had discussed earlier with the admission officer. In that case, why do you feel like the fee is difficult to arrange please?
03/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 247 6509: From  research it seems that university is a private  one of which fes may be too high..I want to believe there are other government universities which may charge affordable fees
03/10/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please share your understanding of the difference between private and government institues?
03/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 247 6509: Iam comparing with the Zimbabwean situation where government universities charge lesser fees than private
03/10/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Let me help you with the Education System of India. There are two types of Universities as shared below -
03/10/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. Public Universities - Since Public University receives funding from the government, they are more affordable and are given more credibility when compared to private universities to be admitted there, students have to sit for a National Level Entrance Exam and there are no scholarships offered, apart from that, there is no provision for international students to take admitted over there.

Hence, there are multiple institutes and colleges affiliated with those universities, and students can enroll in those institutes, the degree which they get is directly from the public university they are affiliated with and has the institute's name written on it. Basically, the students study at an institute/college but are registered with the university.
03/10/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. Private Universities - When we talk about Private Universities, International students can easily be admitted over there on a scholarship, they would pursue their education at the university and would be registered there, however since these are private universities, the fee structures are a little higher when compared to public universities. I hope you are clear with the difference first?
03/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 247 6509: That's fine
03/10/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now as you know there is no provision for International students to be admitted into a Public University, there are multiple institutes that are affiliated with those universities and students can take admissions into those universities by taking admissions at their associated institutes/Colleges. The degrees that students get after completing their education are directly from the university they are affiliated with. I hope this is clear, right?
03/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes we understand
03/10/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear about the reason that you did not receive an offer letter from a government institute?
03/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes we understand
03/10/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, shall we move ahead with our discussion here please?
03/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes
03/10/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may you please also let me know of this as well?
03/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 686 5384: We are looking at our financial state right now and it will be diffulct to arrange the money
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of the same please. Moving ahead, I can understand that it might be difficult for you to arrange the money, however, let us first discuss about the offer letter completely and get clarity on the same and then we will move ahead to have a conversation about the challenges that you are facing in doing that. Will that be okay with you?
05/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Afternoon
05/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 686 5384: We understand sir
05/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes we may proceed
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you have taken a note of Mr. Rajan's details here so that we can move ahead?
06/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Good evening sir
06/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes I have thank you
07/10/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/10/23, 11:21 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
07/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 686 5384: Good morning
07/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 686 5384: We are all doing fine
07/10/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 686 5384: Yesss but we are still discussing about the offer letter since  my parents said it was too expensive for them  and also difficult to arrange the money needed by 12 October
07/10/23, 11:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please dear, thank you for letting me know of that please. We will discuss that with each other moving ahead during our discussion too dear. For now, shall we proceed?
07/10/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 686 5384: Yes
07/10/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 686 5384: We may proceed
07/10/23, 11:25 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
07/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 686 5384: Ok thank you
07/10/23, 11:33 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
07/10/23, 12:14 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Okkk thank you noted l
09/10/23, 6:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 6:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 6:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
09/10/23, 6:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
11/10/23, 8:37 am - +263 71 686 5384: Good morning
11/10/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 686 5384: Sorry for not being able to connect with you as Iam preparing for examinations
11/10/23, 11:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well.

I want to express my gratitude for your patience today, as I was unavailable for our discussion. Moving ahead, I'm pleased to inform you that starting tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT, we'll be holding scheduled sessions. During these sessions, we'll address any concerns or questions you may have and plan the next steps in your admission journey.

Your active participation in these sessions is highly valuable therefore, we will connect with each other here tomorrow at the scheduled time. Have a pleasant night!
13/10/23, 12:06 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Good morning

13/10/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, can you please help me in understanding more about the challenges that you faced due to which you were not able to raise the finances for Mazviita's registration?
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier, when we were connected with each other here so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion and planned the next steps in your higher education journey. Hence, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other here for the same?
16/10/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 360 8257: Good morning . Sorry Mazviita is very busy these days preparing for her final examination the first one is at 2oclock today

16/10/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that, in that case, how were you preparing to raise the finances for Mazviita's admission process?
16/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Hello how are you all
16/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok in my understanding my parents thought the deadline would be a little bit further so that the have enough time to arrange the money
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear. Thank you for letting me know of that please. However, if you would have shared the same with me here earlier, we could have discussed on the same and planned the next steps in your admission journey accordingly. 

Even now, it is not too late and we can still plan the things out in a better way. For that, can you please help me in understanding about two things:

1. By when do you think you would be able to complete the payment of the first part of registration fee?
2. How much amount were you able to raise till now towards Mazviita's registration process?
17/10/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Good morning we are doing fine

17/10/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 360 8257: Good evening.I don't think we can afford such amount of money
17/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 247 6509: Initially we thought the scholarship will bail us out .However from your explanations 750 us for a n ordinary Zimbabwean teacher  is not affordable within a short period
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, I understand that you are finding the finances to be very challenging, however, on that note, can you please help me in understanding more about the fact that if it is the $750 registration fee that is the challenge or the per annum costs please?
18/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 360 8257: Both Good afternoon
18/10/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that we have shared Mazviita's application with one of our other partner universities as well where the costs of her educaiton per annum, would be around $1200-1500 please, what are your thoughts on that please?
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents Mazviita!

19/10/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 686 5384: Thank you very much we are looking forward to it

I hope you are doing well today.

As per the conversation that we had here earlier, where you wished to get a more affordable university for Mazviita's higher education, we had worked towards the same. With all the efforts we have invested, I am thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, MVN University in India, and they have decided to offer you a remarkable 100% scholarship. ⭐

27/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes we went through the acceptance letter
01/11/23, 8:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/11/23, 8:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your availability. However, on that note, I would like to mention that due to some urgent work that came up yesterday, I could not connect with you here in time. Shall we move ahead with our discussion here now?
01/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Good evening . We understand and yes we may continue
01/11/23, 9:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, it has been around two weeks that you have received the offer letter, but we were not able to discuss that yet, hence, can we move ahead to finalize the discussion here and now today so that we can proceed to secure your seat at the university as well?
01/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes we may discuss however my parents are not available
01/11/23, 10:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, let us proceed. Moving ahead, I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
01/11/23, 10:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
02/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 686 5384: 1.$0
2.$0
3.$1250
4.$125
5$1000
02/11/23, 2:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/11/23, 2:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout your course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
02/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes the university has provided us with a great opportunity
02/11/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: 0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
02/11/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1250 + $250 = $1500.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1250. I hope you are clear about that?
02/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes clear
02/11/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure - 

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
02/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes very clear
02/11/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
02/11/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
02/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ookkk I understand
02/11/23, 4:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1250 and so the balance fee becomes $1250 - $1000 = $250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
02/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yesss I understand this
02/11/23, 4:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1500, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1500 - $1000 = $500.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
02/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes .What about before
02/11/23, 4:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you well here. Can you please come again and let me know what do you wish to know?
02/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Sorry was saying so before I come I have to pay $1000
02/11/23, 4:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right. Before you come to India, you only have to pay the registration fee i.e. $1000, however, since you are a part of the Endowment Program, you have a grant of $150 please, this means that you only have to pay $850, I hope this is clear?
02/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok I understand
02/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 686 5384: On top of the $850   I have to pay the $1250
02/11/23, 8:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you well here @263716865384 . Can you please come again and help me in getting clarity on that?
03/11/23, 7:11 am - +263 71 686 5384: Ok iam saying after we pay the admission and process fee .I will pay the $1250 per annum fee later on or immediately
03/11/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mazviita!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/11/23, 11:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here and I now understand your concern. After you pay the admission and processing fee of $850, that fee will then be adjusted to your per annum costs of $1250, this means that the balance fee that you would need to pay will be $1500 - 1000 = $500 before the start of the academic year. The 

$850 is only the registration fee, and the per annum fee covers your annual educational expenses.
03/11/23, 11:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Along with that, from the second year onwards, the total per annum expenses would be $1250 that would be required to be paid in timely manner in two equal parts over a span of 6 months. I hope this is clear?
03/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok I understand thank you
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and MAzviita!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 05:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 05.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
06/11/23, 11:47 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Thank you we will connect then
07/11/23, 5:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and MAzviita!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Good evening yes we may proceed
07/11/23, 6:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, first I would like to answer your query here regarding the per annum expenses, yet, it would be $1250 per annum moving ahead from the second year of your university. I hope this is clear?
07/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yesss I understand
07/11/23, 6:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, on that note if I may ask, do you have any other queries that you would have?
