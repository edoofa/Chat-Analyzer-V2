04/10/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes sir am available .
09/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Am sorry for late respond
09/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No need to apologize. I'm glad you're available now. Let's proceed with our discussion.
09/10/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 869 1789: This stage i understand  that ,that is the stage  which you sent me different Universities  and then i will choose  one that i want .
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes we are on the same page sir.
09/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/10/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes sir i am ready for this.
09/10/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 869 1789: My apology  on my network  sir .
09/10/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes sir we can proceed.
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Noted .
09/10/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Noted sir.
09/10/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes sir.
09/10/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes sir.
09/10/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 869 1789: No sir.
09/10/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 869 1789: No sir i don't  have any query
09/10/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

 I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes sir i am.
09/10/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
09/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Ok noted sir.
09/10/23, 10:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings David I was going throu the the documents and noticed that your I *Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)* was not shared with me could please share it with me as soon as possible
14/10/23, 8:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and David.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Gulzar Group of Institutes in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 8:52 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 12.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 8:52 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 869 1789: Noted.
14/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and David!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutes by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes we gi through  it Sir.
14/10/23, 12:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
14/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 869 1789: 1. $1200
2.$1200
3.$750
14/10/23, 12:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1200.
14/10/23, 12:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
14/10/23, 12:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. Three Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a three-seater (three people staying together) hostel is $1250, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a three-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1200+ $1250) = $2450.

2. Four Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a Four -seater (four people staying together) hostel is $1000, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a four-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1200 + $1000) = $2200.
14/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 869 1789: So the grant is not included on this tuttion fee.
14/10/23, 1:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding the Grant, stay assured that we will discuss about it moving ahead during our conversation. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
14/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes am clear sir.
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad you understand. Given the fact that there are two options for accommodation at Gulzar Group of Institutes, which category would you like to choose for yourself?
16/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 869 1789: The  last category .
16/10/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Good  morning  sir  ,am good  and you.
16/10/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes  sir am clear .
16/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Am sorry  for late responding ,i had an examination .
17/10/23, 1:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alrigh please dear, I am sure that you must have done well in your exam.
17/10/23, 1:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/10/23, 1:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes sir i am clear .
17/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 869 1789: How are sir.
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine please, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2200 and so the balance fee becomes $2200 - $1000 = $1200 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure.
17/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Noted sir.
We will afford .
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: At the same time, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well - 

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee of $2200, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2200 - $750= $1450, and that can be paid in two parts of $725 at a gap of 6 months (August 2023/January 2024). 

Are we on the same page here as well?
18/10/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes sir we are on the same page.
18/10/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
18/10/23, 10:46 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes sir we are on the same  page
18/10/23, 10:46 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Noted.
18/10/23, 10:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 10:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 10:48 pm - +263 78 869 1789: I stay in Kotwa growth point sir in Mudzi district .But i can be able to reech Harare .
18/10/23, 10:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 10:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 10:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 10:50 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Noted sir.
18/10/23, 10:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 10:52 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes sir in case of emergency .
18/10/23, 10:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi

18/10/23, 11:07 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Noted sir.
18/10/23, 11:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/10/23, 11:12 pm - +263 78 869 1789: What if i fail to meet the target of the due dates you provide with me ,do you give a period of time to find the fee.
18/10/23, 11:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask are you facing any challenges in doing the same as per the deadline dates please?
18/10/23, 11:17 pm - +263 78 869 1789: I think that we may face a little  bit of challenge ,but am not sure.
18/10/23, 11:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is what I am asking, why do you feel that you may face a challenge in doing so please?
18/10/23, 11:20 pm - +263 78 869 1789: I was just asking  in case of emergency .
18/10/23, 11:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if you may face any difficulty in doing so, you can then let me know and we will then discuss about the same and plan things ahead for your admission process, I hope this is clear?
18/10/23, 11:22 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Yes sir it is clear .
18/10/23, 11:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. May I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask?
18/10/23, 11:24 pm - +263 78 869 1789: No sir i don't  have.
18/10/23, 11:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

18/10/23, 11:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
18/10/23, 11:34 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Ok sir ,noted.
19/10/23, 10:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from GGI. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from GGI as a family yet?
19/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 869 1789: Good morning  sir
Yes we discussed the offer letter
19/10/23, 11:31 am - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
19/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 869 1789: Mother  told me that she will do all his best to make all the payments needed  for me to proceed with my education .
19/10/23, 11:45 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
19/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 869 1789: Ok go ahead  sir.

I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?

19/10/23, 11:54 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I would highly advise you to do so. Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
19/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 869 1789: The first one sir.
19/10/23, 12:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
19/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 869 1789: For now i don't  have sir but we shall try our best to meet the target  you gave us.
19/10/23, 9:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, I would advise you to finalize a date for the same. With your sessions now completed, and the offer letter in your possession, your next important step is to ensure the payment of your university registration fee within the shared deadline to secure your scholarship seat.
19/10/23, 9:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you've made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I’m here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!

27/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 869 1789: We managed to come up with a date where all the money  for the registration fee will be ready.
28/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 869 1789: Good afternoon sir.
30/10/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I apologize for not responding to your message earlier. When you replied, it was outside of my working hours, and it happened to be the weekend, so our team was unavailable. Thank you for your patience.
30/10/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, since you have mentioned that you do have a date in mind for the completion of your registration process, hence, can you please help me in knowing about the same as well so that we can plan the next steps in your admission journey accordingly?
30/10/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 869 1789: Is it possible  for November .

30/10/23, 10:42 pm - +263 78 869 1789: But the only issue is ,the situation went against our expectations  on the payment of the Fee ,which led us not to meet the target of our dates you gave us.But about the payment of registration fees we already arranged money  for that, the only thing is where we thought we shall have it on time but it is relaying .

Is there any problem  if we just move our target  to 20 november ,but if we manage to have it before that date we will actually pay .On that note we are very certain .
31/10/23, 4:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and David!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/10/23, 4:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your position with me here. Now, on that note, can you please let me know by when would be the right time for us to discuss the same and plan the way ahead for you so that you can complete the admission process accordingly?

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?

I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 12:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Following our last conversation, I had informed the academic board that you would be sharing the mail with them shortly, and they were waiting for your email regarding the confirmation of the payment plan as well as the date of making the payment. However, as it wasn't sent in a timely manner and considering the imminent closure for the current round of applications that will be taking place by tomorrow, I personally took the initiative to have a conversation with the team and university officials on your behalf.

After presenting strong cases and emphasizing the challenges you've encountered, they empathized with your situation. Understanding the circumstances, they have kindly granted an extension for the payment deadline up till 30th November. Hence, it's imperative to proceed with making the payment before the stipulated date.
29/11/23, 12:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: This extension was secured by showcasing our dedication and efforts on your behalf. It's essential to exhibit our goodwill and ensure that the commitment made on your behalf is upheld.

Please proceed with the payment as agreed upon before the extended deadline. Should you encounter any difficulties or need further assistance, feel free to connect with me at your earliest convenience.
