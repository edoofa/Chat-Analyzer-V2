My parents pay for my tuition
08/09/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand, then I am sure, you will understand the questions, The sponsor is the person who will cater for your higher education, usually, the sponsor is mostly the parent or the guardian of the student

I hope we are clear now?
08/09/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam

Thank you for sharing the forms it is duly noted with us and we will update them in our records. 

Now that we are done with the forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
08/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good afternoon
08/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Let's proceed
08/09/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
08/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
08/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
08/09/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
08/09/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
08/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam they are
08/09/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
08/09/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
08/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Understood
08/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
08/09/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
08/09/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
08/09/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes ma'am understood
08/09/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
08/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 455 7432: We  can proceed
08/09/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
08/09/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
08/09/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
08/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
08/09/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
08/09/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

08/09/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
08/09/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
08/09/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
08/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 455 7432: 9 pm today
08/09/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, we shall reconnect today at 09.00 pm.
08/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Thank you ma'am...enjoy the rest of your day
08/09/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome and thank you.
08/09/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
08/09/23, 10:33 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good evening ma'am
08/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 71 455 7432: I'm so sorry...I was having terrible network challenges  , but l successfully managed to watch all the videos
08/09/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
08/09/23, 10:35 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
08/09/23, 10:41 pm - +263 71 455 7432: The two most important things are diligence and following instructions.  All the schools in the Edoofa Scholarship program are good schools as they were all picked carefully for students. Edoofa and it's group of universities and colleges provide education that is employable and affordable. The EWYL program is available in all the Edoofa schools,  this program is to help the student earn credits that make education cheaper...The program also helps the student develop a skill set that is necessary for a fully equipped person in the professional world.  The SOP is a document or form that l the student will get assistance in making, the form is my university application form
08/09/23, 10:45 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Oh and the other thing...

I should go to bed confidently knowing that lm a proud EDOOFIAN😌😅
08/09/23, 11:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding I am happy to know that you are a proud Edoofian. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
08/09/23, 11:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
08/09/23, 11:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
08/09/23, 11:12 pm - +263 71 455 7432: I ageee
08/09/23, 11:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
12/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 455 7432: 1. Give a brief introduction, highlighting your skills with an example (Audio format)
12/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 455 7432: 2. Please elaborate on the scope and importance of Medical lab Technology
12/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 455 7432: A medical lab technician is a healthcare professional who performs chemical, microscopic, and microbiological diagnostic analyses on body fluids such as blood, urine, sputum,stool, cerebrospinal fluid ,  pericardial fluid, and synovial fluid, as well ad other specimens. The findings after investigations are used by the medical team to make decisions regarding a patients healthcare . In treatment of a patient, medical lab technician play the primary role because they do the diagnostic. No treatment can be done without an idea of the problem. Medical Laboratory Science has played a significant role in the advancement in the field of Medicine.

Scope of mlt -_-
• Collection and receiving of specimens.
•Calibration and standardization of equipment .
• Standardization and selection of test. analytical procedures.
• Maintenance of supplies of laboratory reagents.
• Preparation of chemical and biological reagents.
• Maintenance of records and preparation of statistics.
• They look for bacteria, parasites, and other microorganisms.
• They use automated equipment and computerized instruments capable of performing a number of tests simultaneously, as well as microscopes, cell counters, and other sophisticated laboratory equipment.
• Then they analyze the results and relay them to physicians.
12/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 455 7432: 3. What is GLP (Good Laboratory Practice) and why is it followed in the LAB?
12/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 455 7432: GLP...Good Lab Practice. 

This are the practices that ensure the quality, safety and correct organization of pharmaceutical research. GLP is done to maintain consistently high standards and comply with any  regulations set by government agencies. 

Following are examples  of GLP...

● Audit and inspections 
~these must be done regularly to ensure that proper practices are being followed. Audits primarily cover research protocol,processes and reporting. Inspections take place by external regulatory bodies.  

●Standard operating procedures 
~these are guidelines to be followed by inspectors and laboratories. They should be accessible to all members of staff. 
~ these ensure that proper standards are being met and they establish efficient production and reliable research results.

●Data recording 
~includes what the test was,how it was performed, when it was carried out and who did it. All data must be recorded to reduce errors. Staff should never rely on memory.
~These practices ensure traceability and correct record keeping. Standard lab notebooks are used for this task.

●Correct use of equipment 
~ use of wrong equipment creates wrong data or information. Equipment recalibration should be done before using equipment. Records of maintenance should also be kept. 


GLP is required to avoid mistakes and errors and make sure everyone is following the same rules. This leads to productions of proper results. These GLP should be employed to ensure there are more successful research items
12/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 455 7432: 4.Kindly mention different sterilisation methods used in Lab, why are they important?
Explain any one of them in detail please
12/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Sterilization is widely employed to destroy all forms of living microorganism in a substance.It involves the application of heat/chemical on the substance like drugs, food, surgical equipment, nutraceuticals etc. if food materials are not subjected to sterilization, chances are that it contains dangerous bacteria which can cause severe infection when consumed. Disease-causing bacteria usually aren't  visible to the naked eye and hence a variety of sterilization techniques are employed in microbiology. Although there are many techniques of sterilization available out there, heat and chemical method is widely employed to sterile metals and food substances.

I'm going to explain radiation sterilisation.

Radiation

Ultraviolet light is effective for controlling microbes in the food substance. It has a higher wavelength that lies between 100 nm and 400 nm. The energy is about 265nm, which is strong enough to destroy microbes. When microbes are subjected to radiation, ultraviolet radiation penetrates into the core DNA and thymine molecules. During the process of photosynthesis, the linked thymine molecules could not align the adenine of RNA molecules, as a result, the molecular structure changed. Further, the chromosome replication is impaired. Since this microorganism is damaged, it cannot produce proteins and dies shortly.

It is not surprising that the ultraviolet rays from the sun play a vital role in controlling microorganism in the layer of air and soil. The same way, ultraviolet is used to reduce the microbe population. It is also used to reduce the surface contamination in the morgue, toilet, pharmacy, hospital room, food operation room etc.
12/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 455 7432: 5. Explain a few techniques for placing samples under a microscope ?
12/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 455 7432: The main methods of placing samples onto microscope slides are wet mount, dry mount, smear, squash and staining.

Dry Mount:

The dry mount is the most basic technique: simply position a thinly sliced section on the center of the slide and place a cover slip over the sample.

Dry mounts are ideal for observing hair, feathers, airborne particles such as pollens and dust as well as dead matter such as insect and aphid legs or antennae. Opaque specimens require very fine slices for adequate illumination.

Since they are used for primarily inorganic and dead matter, dry mounts can theoretically last indefinitely.

Wet Mount:

Used for aquatic samples, living organisms and natural observations, wet mounts suspend specimens in fluids such as water, brine, glycerin and immersion oil. A wet mount requires a liquid, tweezers, pipette and paper towels.

Staining:

A variety of methods exist for staining microscope slides, including non-vital or in vitro stains of non-living cells and vital or in vivo stains of living tissue. Staining provides contrast through color that reveals structural details undetected in other slide preparations.

Staining solutions such as iodine, methylene blue and crystal violet can be added to wet or dry mounts.

A simple staining method:

Add a drop of staining solution on the edge of one side of the cover slip

Position the edge of a paper towel on the opposite end

Allow dye to be pulled across the specimen

Stains are especially useful in the fields of histology, virology and pathology, allowing researchers to study and diagnose diseases, identify gram positive and negative bacteria as well as examine detailed attributes of a variety of cells.

13/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 455 7432: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
13/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
13/09/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
13/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Ms. Saloni
13/09/23, 8:59 pm - +263 71 455 7432: I already sent them
13/09/23, 8:59 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same, I hope you have a wonderful journey ahead with your Mentor!
13/09/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Thank you maam
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
13/09/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
13/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
13/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
13/09/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
13/09/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
13/09/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam he did
13/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
13/09/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
13/09/23, 9:40 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Noted
13/09/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
13/09/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
13/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Understood
13/09/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
13/09/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
13/09/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
13/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
13/09/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the process. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction. We will reconnect tomorrow at the same time.
13/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Thank you maam
13/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
14/09/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Alex.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good evening ma'am
14/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes we may proceed
14/09/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now I believe you have had a discussion with your family regarding your admission process, so I would like to know if you have any queries or concerns to share?
14/09/23, 9:40 pm - +263 71 455 7432: What are the consequences for missing the payment deadline for registration 

How broad is the payment period
14/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query, however, before I answer that, I would like to know what makes you think that you will not be able to make the payment as per the deadlines given by the university  for the registration?
14/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 455 7432: There are severe economic challenges that Zimbabwe is facing as a country 


That might be a factor
14/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 71 455 7432: But my parents will try their best to make the ends meet
14/09/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I completely understand, however, I am sure, your parents are working hard for your higher education and they will not let anything happen that will affect your higher education, right?
14/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
14/09/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
14/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Not yet maam
14/09/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand Alex, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
14/09/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
14/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Totally, one hundred percent ma'am
14/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 455 7432: The payment plan sounds flexible
14/09/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
14/09/23, 10:24 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
14/09/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
14/09/23, 10:27 pm - +263 71 455 7432: No ma'am l wasn't aware of that
14/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
14/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
14/09/23, 10:30 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Understood
14/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Done✅
14/09/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
14/09/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
14/09/23, 10:33 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
14/09/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/09/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/09/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/09/23, 10:35 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Understood
14/09/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/09/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/09/23, 10:37 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes Ms Kirti
14/09/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/09/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/09/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/09/23, 10:40 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Understood ✅
14/09/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with our discussion however, as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I would reconnect with you tomorrow at 02.00 p.m. to resume our discussion. 

I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
14/09/23, 10:46 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Have a good night ma'am
14/09/23, 10:46 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Thank you
14/09/23, 10:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you have a great night to you too.
15/09/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alex.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
15/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good afternoon ma'am
15/09/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
15/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 455 7432: I would appreciate it if you provided more information
15/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
15/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
15/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
15/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam l understand
15/09/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for the delay in response, as I was attending a meeting may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good evening ma'am
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam let's proceed
15/09/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you have any queries till here?
15/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 71 455 7432: No ma'am....every thing is clear
15/09/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
15/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
15/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
15/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam l agree
15/09/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once your results come in 2024, you will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
15/09/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
15/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam l understand
15/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and instead of reappearing for his/her exams and starting with his/her Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
15/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
15/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
15/09/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
15/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Clear as day
15/09/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
15/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam they are clear
15/09/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. Let us reconnect tomorrow at 10.00 am. I hope you will be available tomorrow.
15/09/23, 10:40 pm - +263 71 455 7432: I might have challenges connecting with you at 10 am

Is it possible to arrange for time in the afternoon
15/09/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, may I know if 01.00 pm tomorrow will be fine?
15/09/23, 10:44 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
15/09/23, 10:44 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Thank you very much for understanding
15/09/23, 10:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome have a great night.
16/09/23, 9:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Alex.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good afternoon ma'am
20/09/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Alex,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with receiving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students.
20/09/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good evening ma'am
20/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263714557432 I hope you are doing well.
21/09/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 455 7432: Good morning
21/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alex.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to connect with each other yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/09/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 455 7432: We may start
21/09/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know,  I hope you were able to have a discussion as a family by now so I'm interested in knowing how the discussion went regarding the advantages of early decision benefits, as we discussed previously?
21/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 455 7432: They loved the idea ma'am
21/09/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
21/09/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 455 7432: They are currently at work ma'am
21/09/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I am sure, they will be able to go through the conversation once they are available. 

Now, I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
21/09/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
21/09/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
21/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 455 7432: We are on the same page
21/09/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
21/09/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
21/09/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
21/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
21/09/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
21/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
21/09/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 21st of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 06th of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
21/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam l understand
21/09/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
21/09/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
21/09/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 21st of September, the deadline becomes the 06th of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 21st of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 06th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 06th of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
21/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 455 7432: We're on the same page
21/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
21/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Everything is clear
21/09/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
21/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 455 7432: 1..
Standard registration 

The registration fee is to be paid within 15 days. It ranges from 500 to 750 USD. 

2...
Early admission 

This is for students who apply before their results are out. There are 6 benefits that come with early admission. EDOOFA gives the student a 150 USD Grant meaning the student had to pay 500 dollars, assuming the registration is 750. The first 300 is to be paid within 15 days and the second to be paid within one month, which is another additional 15 days
21/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
21/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Clear✅
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *06th October* and *06th November*.
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would want your parents to come online and if they are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *06th of October and 06th of November*), can you give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare your application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
21/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Before Monday ❔
21/09/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please since you mentioned that your parents are not available right now, and if you are unable to have a discussion by tomorrow which is Friday then we will be connecting on Monday to know your thoughts and if your parents are ready to give us a go-ahead so that we can prepare your application for the scholarship and share it with the universities.
21/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 455 7432: The will be in touch in the evening to give you the go ahead
21/09/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, let us reconnect in the evening. I hope you and your parents are available to connect at 09.00 pm.
21/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes, thank you maam
21/09/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great day ahead!
25/09/23, 6:58 am - +263 77 571 1236: Good morning Ms Kirt, sorry  for the delaywe haven't been available  but you can proceed with the applications
25/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good afternoon ma'am
25/09/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Alex.

I hope you are doing well, and had a fruitful weekend. That is alright please since it was the weekend we were not available to connect as well. May I know if you are available to connect with us today so that we can move ahead with the discussion?
25/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam let's begin
25/09/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that your parents have given us the go-ahead to move forward with your university admission process, I believe they are financially confident that they will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *06th of October and 06th of November*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
25/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam we are prepared
25/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, as your parents have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing your application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for your higher education well.
25/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes maam
25/09/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, with this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Am l still able to make early admission
25/09/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.
25/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Understood
25/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Thank you maam
25/09/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great day ahead.
25/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Same to u
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Alex!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 12.30 PM. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Thank you very much sir for the great news
29/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Alex!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
29/09/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good afternoon
29/09/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes sir we are
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
29/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 455 7432: 1. $900 USD 
2. 4 years or 8 semesters 
3. $300 USD 
4. $750 USD
29/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
29/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes sir
29/09/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
29/09/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
29/09/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
29/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Understood
29/09/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
29/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes sir we are
29/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
29/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 455 7432: I understand
29/09/23, 2:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
29/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 455 7432: When you say waived off,you mean l am not to pay it❔
29/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Since l got early admission, isn't it that the Edoofa Scholarship program will pay $150 USD from the $750
29/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right, since it is waived off, you do not have to pay it.
29/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
29/09/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
29/09/23, 2:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
29/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 455 7432: That is great news 😅
29/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes sir understood
29/09/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
29/09/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 455 7432: I stay in Kadoma
29/09/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
29/09/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
29/09/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
29/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Understood
29/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Is there another payment method that includes a direct transaction to the bank
29/09/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please.  Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
29/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes sir
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
29/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 455 7432: I will tell you when my parents have decided  which method to use
29/09/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure dear. Now, for your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
29/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Understood
29/09/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
29/09/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
29/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes sir
29/09/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
29/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes sir l understand
29/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
29/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 455 7432: No sir..I understood everything
29/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Thank you
29/09/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
29/09/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Alex!

How are you doing today? Were you able to have a conversation as a family regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University by now?
01/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good afternoon
01/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 455 7432: I haven't received the email from the university yet, does the process usually take this long
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Alex!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here dea.r On that note, I would like to mention that there might be an error in your detaila that are present in our records, therefore, may you please re-confirm that on which Email ID would you like to receive the offer letter?
03/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 455 7432: alemafindi3@gmail.com
03/10/23, 4:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here, let me share it with the university officials and get the letter mailed again.
03/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Thank you very much sir
03/10/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, may I know if you were able to have a conversation with your parents about the offer letter from Galgotias University please?
03/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes sir
03/10/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's great to know that you spoke with your family about your career and I'm confident they were happy to see you making progress in the right direction. How did the conversation with your family go? What were their thoughts?
03/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 455 7432: They just had slight concerns on accommodation
03/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 455 7432: If l am to stay off campus 

Would l get assistance in  finding a place to stay
03/10/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students.
03/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 455 7432: For how much annually
03/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, when it comes to finding off-campus accommodation the university officials along with the Department of Student Welfare here at Edoofa will help you in finding the same. And the costs for the same would be around $800 per annum with the food costs factored in. I hope this is clear?
03/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 455 7432: It is clear sir
03/10/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask dear? <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 455 7432: What type of foods are included in their menus
03/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 455 7432: The type of food they provide
05/10/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Alex!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, regarding the query that you have asked about the food, can you please give me clarity whether you are asking about the off-campus accommodation or the on-campus one?
05/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good afternoon sir
05/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 455 7432: U stated that the 800 dollars is for accommodation and food 

For off campus
05/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 455 7432: And the other thing....

I still haven't received the email from the university yet
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right. Now, in case of off-campus accommodation, students have two options with them, either they can buy their food from outside or they can cook for themselves. 

For both the options, there is no fixed choice of food, hence, they can eat whatever they wish to. I hope this is clear?
05/10/23, 4:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Before that, may I know if you are clear till here dear?
05/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 71 455 7432: So basically it's 800 dollars for accommodation without food
06/10/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Alex!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alex, I believe you are confused here. Let me help you with your concern here properly so that you can get better clarity on the same. 

The Off-campus accommodation options at Galgotias University cost around $800 per annum. Now, in this $800, the rent and food costs are both factored in please. This means that within this $800 per annum your rental will be catered to and along with that, you would have the other portion of money left to cater for your food. I hope you are clear with that?
06/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Yes sir...understood
07/10/23, 11:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Alex!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/10/23, 11:19 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Moving ahead, may I know if you have any other queries to ask please?
07/10/23, 6:52 pm - +263 71 455 7432: No sir
07/10/23, 6:53 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Just  that l still haven't received the email from the university yet
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Alex!
I hope you are doing well.
11/10/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Alex, stay assured that I have already informed the university officials of the same and they would be mailing the same soon. The reason that it might be delayed is that the university is currently processing a large number of applications and hence, it is taking time. I hope you understand this?
11/10/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet? <This message was edited>

Hence, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other here for the same?
16/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good afternoon sir

I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand that dear, however, since we were already in a conversation about your offer letter, you should have informed me that you have an exam, so that we could have planned the next steps in a better way, right?

17/10/23, 5:50 pm - +263 71 455 7432: Good afternoon sir
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Alex!

18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alex, can you please let me know what have your parents planned in order for completing your admission process, since we are already 5 days past the deadline date that was given by the university to complete your admission process please?
19/10/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 455 7432: Good morning Mr Singh
19/10/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 455 7432: Was that offer from galgotias the only one l got or the Edoofa team chose the best among the ones l received
19/10/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Alex!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here please?
19/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 455 7432: Yes sir it is clear
19/10/23, 10:54 am - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
19/10/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 455 7432: Understood
19/10/23, 11:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?

27/10/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Alex!
I hope you are doing well today.
27/10/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side the other day we were connected with each other here. Moving ahead, from what we had discussed with each other here the last time we connected, we were planning to make the payment of $200 that you have now in order to secure Alex's scholarship with the university. 

Now, can you please let me know what have you planned to do in that case and how do you wish to move ahead with the registration process?
08/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 71 455 7432: Good morning

I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.
