12/10/23, 4:05 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Wanted to ask on visa application what other requirements do they need..
12/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @27846201892 please be assured that all your queries will be answered as we move ahead with our discussions. So may I know if you are ready to start with Gracious's Admission process for the year 2024?
12/10/23, 4:13 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Yes am ready...
12/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
12/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
12/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
12/10/23, 4:19 pm - +27 84 620 1892: We are excited indeed...
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
12/10/23, 4:43 pm - +27 84 620 1892: This message was deleted
12/10/23, 4:44 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Am done ma'am...
12/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
12/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 4:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Gracious, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
12/10/23, 5:33 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Noted with thanks...
12/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 8:43 pm - +27 84 620 1892: This is great news ma'am Edoofa is doing a good job 🙏🏾🙏🏾
12/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/10/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 8:48 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Yes ma'am..
12/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 27, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 27, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 27, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/10/23, 9:01 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Unfortunately right I have to clear fees for my son who is here at University of Pretoria so i wont  be able to pay  registration fees this month.
12/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @27846201892 I completely understand the situation you are in, however, let me help you understand that the generation of offer letters depends upon the university please, every university has a different timeline for evaluating the applications and then generating the offer letter, so please do not worry.
12/10/23, 9:41 pm - +27 84 620 1892: That's amazing maam because I dont want to miss this opportunity for my daughter...
12/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand no parent would want to miss on this opportunity. Now Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/10/23, 9:43 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Please provide me with more information
12/10/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/10/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
12/10/23, 9:55 pm - +27 84 620 1892: I wìll get through this tomorrow ma'am need to rest now...
12/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand, you must be tired let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm. Have a great night and rest well.
12/10/23, 9:57 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good night 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
13/10/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Gracious.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
13/10/23, 3:13 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good day ma'am yes am available
13/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/10/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that so may I know if you are clear so far?
13/10/23, 3:16 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Yes am clear...
13/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
13/10/23, 3:24 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Noted ...
13/10/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
13/10/23, 3:48 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Yes i agree...
13/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
13/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
13/10/23, 7:55 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Very clear ma'am. Sorry for late response was busy with work..
13/10/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
13/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
13/10/23, 9:44 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Very clear
13/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
13/10/23, 9:46 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Understood
13/10/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 9:50 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Everything clear...
13/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Gracious guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that gracious is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
13/10/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @27846201892 may I know if we are still connected?
14/10/23, 6:35 am - +27 84 620 1892: Good morning am very excited ma'am.
14/10/23, 8:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Gracious.

I hope you are doing well, I am glad to hear that. With this, I'd like to conclude our discussion, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
14/10/23, 8:46 am - +27 84 620 1892: Blessed day too ma'am 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

18/10/23, 7:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Gracious,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 7:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 8:06 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good evening everyone... Yes I went through it but the problem is as I said earlier that right now am busy with my other son's tuition fees which is due before end of December so I dont think i will be able to meet this deadline of $300... I dont know if there is another option so that we wont miss this opportunity...
18/10/23, 10:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you were able to review the offer letter, and I completely understand your situation. Managing your priorities, especially with your son's tuition fees due by the end of December, is essential. It's reassuring to see your careful planning and budgeting.
18/10/23, 10:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Regarding the Early Registration Scheme and the $300 deadline, I want to assure you that we will explore possible options to ensure you don't miss this opportunity. We value your commitment to your children's education.
18/10/23, 10:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Before we discuss your situation further and explore alternatives, it's important for you to have a clear understanding of the offer letter. Gathering all the details will ensure we have enough information on hand to make an informed decision about your child's scholarship application and help you complete the admission formalities within the timeline. I hope you resonat with the same?
19/10/23, 7:13 am - +27 84 620 1892: Good morning everyone... Thank you so much am glad you understand my situation...
19/10/23, 9:26 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning to you as well @27846201892 and I am glad to see that we both are together. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 9:26 am - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
19/10/23, 10:14 am - +27 84 620 1892: Noted with thanks...
19/10/23, 10:19 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are all set to discuss Gracious's offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
19/10/23, 10:20 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s Gracious's per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
19/10/23, 10:31 am - +27 84 620 1892: 1.Tuition fees after the scholarship is $900
2. Standard duration of her course is 3 years. 
3. Admission and procedure fee is $300.
4. $750
19/10/23, 10:38 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in Gracious's offer letter, her course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling six semesters for his degree. 

With the scholarship offered, her tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means her annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
19/10/23, 10:39 am - +27 84 620 1892: Yes
19/10/23, 10:52 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased that we have been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
19/10/23, 10:52 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
19/10/23, 10:52 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, Gracious can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- Gracious will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist her in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, Gracious as a student can also look for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
19/10/23, 11:05 am - +27 84 620 1892: Ohh this great news atleast $800 to $1200 is a bit affordable.
Wanted to ask that on campus accommodation fee its once of payment ?
19/10/23, 11:18 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Indeed @27846201892. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation and were able to take note of the same. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. 

Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
19/10/23, 11:27 am - +27 84 620 1892: Yes indeed.
19/10/23, 11:34 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Continuing the discussion regarding Gracious's offer letter, now as you can see in the offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
19/10/23, 11:47 am - +27 84 620 1892: Very clear .
19/10/23, 11:54 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to Gracious's overall cost of education.
19/10/23, 11:55 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Yes we are together but I dont think i will meet this deadline..
19/10/23, 2:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I can understand your concern @27846201892 and thank you for sharing this with me. As you can see the admission and processing fee of $300 mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme & the Endowment Plan for Edoofians. This means it will not be added to Gracious's overall cost of education.
19/10/23, 2:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This special gesture has been granted to the student, considering the economic challenges in Zimbabwe and the financial priori commitments parents have in place. However, it's essential to understand that you are competing for an international scholarship, and students from all over the world are vying for this scholarship seat. Given this, universities have to establish timelines to provide equal opportunities to all students.
19/10/23, 2:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Gracious's through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that she is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/10/23, 4:07 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Yes please explain....
19/10/23, 4:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Gracious's behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/10/23, 4:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Gracious's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/10/23, 9:13 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good evening let me try to run around but i doubt if i will get it because my budget for Gracious is early next yr...
19/10/23, 9:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, @27846201892, take a day or two to work out your finances. I understand that your initial plan was for Gracious to complete her admission process early next year. However, Gracious has managed to secure an offer letter early, which has granted her the benefits of the Endowment Plan. This plan can significantly alleviate your financial burden in the coming years. Have you considered this aspect?
19/10/23, 9:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In simpler terms, if you were to initiate Gracious's admission process early next year, you would have a longer timeframe to pay the $750, but now, you have to pay $750 within 15 days. Furthermore, by securing the scholarship seat now, Gracious will have the same benefits next year. This means her per annum cost of education might be slightly higher in the future, as universities may revise their fee structures.
19/10/23, 9:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: By adopting this approach, you'll be saving on long-term finances. I hope this perspective helps you see the bigger picture, and with some adjustments in your financial preparation, you might be able to work out a plan.
20/10/23, 10:20 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Gracious,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. In our conversation yesterday, we were in the midst of addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission and the scholarship offer letter from Galgotias University.

However, halfway through our discussion, we did not receive a response from your end, and consequently, I have been expecting a reply from you. Could you please confirm if you had the opportunity to go through my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
20/10/23, 10:24 am - +27 84 620 1892: Good morning how are you?
20/10/23, 10:25 am - +27 84 620 1892: I will go through the message today in the afternoon...
20/10/23, 10:30 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am doing well, and thank you for confirming, @27846201892. I am glad to see that we are still connected. In light of this, could you let me know by what time will you be able to review the messages from yesterday and respond? 

This will help us schedule our discussion accordingly and ensure that we can complete our conversation today. This way, you will have all the details you need and can focus on completing Gracious' university admission formalities in a timely manner.
21/10/23, 7:28 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good evening sorry for the late response was busy with work .. Truly speaking am very stressed because i dont want to miss this opportunity but unfortunately right now financially am not stable because of some challenges am facing...
26/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Gracious,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the messages you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:12 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good evening sir how are you?
26/10/23, 9:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you for asking ma'am. Due to the festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 9:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
26/10/23, 9:16 pm - +27 84 620 1892: 08:00 am is fine with me..
26/10/23, 9:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your response @27846201892. I am glad to hear that you will be available tomorrow at 8 am. We look forward to our discussion and will be ready to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. If you have any specific topics or questions you would like to address during our discussion tomorrow, feel free to share them here in your admission group overnight, and we will make sure to cover them tomorrow.
30/10/23, 10:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Gracious!
I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to let you know that Ms. Vilsha could not connect with you here in due time since she is not feeling well and is taking rest till the time she is completely fit. I appreciate your patience here.
30/10/23, 10:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, I believe you are aware of the fact that the deadline date given by the university to make the payment of your registration fee is tomorrow. On that note I am sure that you must have prepared to complete your admission process accordingly. Now, if you have any queries or concerns that you wish to share, you can do that here, otherwise, I will be waiting to get an update from your end regarding the payment of the registration fee.
31/10/23, 7:25 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good evening sorry for late response was trying to run around to pay registration fee but unfortunately i failed to get it...
Get well soon to Ms Vilsha 🙏🏾
31/10/23, 11:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Gracious!

31/10/23, 11:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for sharing the update with me here. Now, on that note, can you please let me know the reason that you could not get it completed and how are you planning to complete the registration now?
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Gracious!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 07:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 07.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 6:37 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good evening everyone... alright l will be available
07/11/23, 7:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Gracious!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 8:50 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Sorry we had load shedding and my fone was flat... We can move ahead..
07/11/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, earlier when we I connected with you here, you had mentioned that you were not able to complete the registration. On that note, can you please let me know how is it that you are planning to complete the same?
08/11/23, 4:45 am - +27 84 620 1892: Good morning...Am sure I will be able to complete registration next yr around march thats when i will be free..
08/11/23, 7:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Gracious!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/11/23, 7:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. On that note, can you please first help me in understanding more about the challenges that you faced this time in completing your admission process due to which you were not able to do the same?
08/11/23, 7:41 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good evening am fine how are you?
08/11/23, 7:46 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Well I have 3 kids my first born is at University of Pretoria and its his final year second at University of Zimbabwe and last born Gracious so am facing some financial problems coz i have to clear their tuition before end of February. But definitely after that i will be able to pay Gracious's registration fee.
08/11/23, 8:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that, however, for clearing their fee, you have till the month of February, right?
08/11/23, 9:00 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Correct..
08/11/23, 9:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please help me in understanding that if you would proceed with Gracious's admission process now, what would be the challenges that you will face?
08/11/23, 9:27 pm - +27 84 620 1892: I only have financial problems now ..
08/11/23, 9:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask what are those financial problems/challenges that are bothering you?
10/11/23, 7:59 am - +27 84 620 1892: Sorry i don't understand here
14/11/23, 9:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Gracious!
I hope you are doing well today.
14/11/23, 9:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Firstly, please accept our sincere apologies for the delay in getting back to you. The team was observing a week-long break due to the Diwali celebrations, and unfortunately, we weren’t available to address queries during that time.
14/11/23, 9:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you have mentioned you did not understand the here. I wanted to ask about the financial challenges that you have mentioned earlier. What are the challenges that are causing hindrance in moving ahead with Gracious's admission process?
14/11/23, 9:29 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good evening..As I said earlier I have 2 other kids who are at University so am busy clearing the fees.
15/11/23, 7:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Gracious!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/11/23, 7:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I do understand that, however, on that note, I would like to mention that along with the other two kids, you also have to think about Gracious's higher education as well, right?
15/11/23, 8:25 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Very correct
15/11/23, 8:26 pm - +27 84 620 1892: And i will make sure she go to university without fail
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please, and I like the spirit. Now, on that note, since we were in the middle of completing Gracious's admission process, and were not able to do so due to the financial challenges that you had mentioned, can you please let me know how is it that you wish to do that now?
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Am sure i will be able to pay in March
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. But in that case, you will be losing on the financial benefits that you are getting now along with the Grant. Don't you think that would create a bigger burden on you in terms of finances?
15/11/23, 9:17 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Let me run around maybe i will get the money.
15/11/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are willing to run around for Gravious. However, running around without any direction won't lead us to getting any positive results, right? In that case, shall we discuss about a payment plan that might help you in dealing with the situation?
15/11/23, 9:25 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Alright
15/11/23, 9:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, for me to be able to help you in drafting a plan that suits you, can you please help me in understanding about the amount that you are comfortable in raising every month towards Gracious's registration fee?
15/11/23, 9:50 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Alright ler me come back to you tomorrow had a hectic day so am very tired want to rest ... Thank you good night 🙏🙏
