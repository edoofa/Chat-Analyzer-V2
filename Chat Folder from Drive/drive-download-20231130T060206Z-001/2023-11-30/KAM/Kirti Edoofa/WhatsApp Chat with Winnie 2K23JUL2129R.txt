03/08/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 260 6194: 2) Difference between Rights and duties 
Key difference: Rights are legal, social or ethical principals of freedom that people are entitled for by a governing body, whereas duties are responsibilities or obligations of an individual, by the governing body, that are required to done by the said individual.
Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. One does not exist without the other. The test of someone has the ‘right’ to something is by whether if someone else has the duty to provide it. The two terms ‘right and its correlative duty’ are inseparable from each other. So, to understand the difference between them, we differentiate the two terms.

Rights ‘Rights’ are defined as the normative rules that are set by a legal jurisdiction, and are owned by the people. Rights are something that every human being deserves, no mater where they come from, or are born in, or where they live in. Rights are generally written into laws. Based on this, people can very easily challenge or defend their rights in the court of law.

It is important to remember that rights are based on a set of agreed behavior and responsibilities that are expected to result in mutual respect and cooperation. A right is not just a law that allows individuals or governing bodies to do or say anything they wish. It is the foundation or framework on which society as a whole structure and defines itself. It is considered to be one of the pillars that let to the establishment of our society and culture.

Other such pillar is ‘duty’, because every rights existence is based on the existence of its duty. ‘Duties’ are defined as things that are to be completed or be followed by an individual. It is extremely important for an individual to perform their duties, so as to protect their rights for the benefit of the society, participating in government, respecting others, respecting diversity, etc. Similarly, the rights of a citizen are freedom of speech, press, petition and assembly, quartering warrants or arrests. 

A simple definition is that, human rights are the rights one has for being a human being. Comparatively, civil rights are contextual, meaning one can be entitled to specific civil rights through being a citizen of a particular country, nation or state Civil rights are proclaimed by the government for the citizens of that country, while human rights are derived from natural law and are universally protected and applied.
03/08/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Winne.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing question 1 and 2 of the academic interview questions, I shall wait for your response for the rest of the questions.
03/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 260 6194: 3)prosecuter is a lawyer for the state who represent the complainant in a criminal trial while an attorney is a lawyer who is not a state lawyer  and not limited to only criminal matters.The only difference is that prosecutor is employed by the state whilst an attorney can be in private practice etc. Basically all prosecutors are attorneys but not all attorneys are prosecutors. A prosecutor is responsible for representing individuals and corporations in civil cases and ensuring that the law is followed in criminal cases. As a consultant to their clients, lawyers serve as a resource to them, educating them about their rights and guiding them through the complex world of law. Moreover, one of the critical distinguishing factors is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, while the defense attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts ti to maintain their client's innocence.
03/08/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Winne.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing questions 1, 2, and 3 of the academic interview questions, I shall wait for your response to the rest of the questions.
03/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 260 6194: 4) 4) I really desire to do criminal law as my course. After a careful research and analysis i have realized that committing crimes has become a normal habit in the society, as such i have a greater vision of making a greater difference. Moreover, some reasons also include :
1 variety of career options
I have realized that a degree in criminal justice is the getway to different professions. These professions include law enforcement, the court system and legal jobs such as paralegal, judicial assistant or corrections.
2) Opportunity to help others
A career in criminal justice is a great way to give back to the community. This field is full of jobs that help others ', from law enforcement to to working in the court system, i will be protecting people from criminal
 activity, helping crime victims and ensuring justice for them as well as the society.
3) Job stability
Many jobs in law enforcement or criminal justice are public sector jobs. Hence crime is a fact of life that doesn't take holidays or down time. As a public servant, my position will not be volatile since it isn't as dependent on the ups and downs of the economy or a tough job market
03/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 260 6194: 5) I believe i possess necessary skills for this field. These skills include :

1) Oratory skills
2) public speaking
3) defending skills 
4) research and analysis 

 *EXAMPLE* 
During my high school i was a public speaker as well as a debater. Being in such a field i would represent my school at different occasions as a public speaker and on more that one occasion i got compliments of being fluent, bold and confident. At one point our debating was supposed to represent the school in Ghana for international debate competitions but however we could not make it because the school coffers were empty. In as much as i have these skills within me i strongly believe that i can be a successful lawyer
03/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 260 6194: I am done answering all the questions... Thank you
03/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
03/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
03/08/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
03/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Very correct
03/08/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
03/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Yes sir
03/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
03/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
03/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
03/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Yes sir, it is not possible
03/08/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
03/08/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
03/08/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
03/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Yes, everything has been clearly explained to me
03/08/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
03/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Well understood
03/08/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
03/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Very clear
03/08/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
03/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 260 6194: I am following
03/08/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
03/08/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 260 6194: I have no queries as everything is very clear
03/08/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
03/08/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Ok... Thank you Sir
03/08/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
04/08/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 260 6194: Good morning, i need some clarity on the issue of Admission fee
04/08/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Winnie.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for your query, however, could you please let me know which part of the admission fee you want me to clarify, please?
04/08/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 260 6194: This admission fee has to be paid soon after receiving the offer letter from a certain university right? When is this admission fee likely to be needed, is it likely to be this month?
04/08/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, let me explain @263712606194 since your admission process will start after August 2023 for a rough idea you can consider that it will stretch till mid-September or early October. Also, once you start with your EWYL Program, you can learn and earn too. So please do not worry you have ample amount of time.
04/08/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Thank you for the explanation
04/08/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
04/08/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Winnie, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 10:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Winnie.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress @263712606194 @263773691078?
19/10/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 260 6194: .. Greetings,I am available
19/10/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
19/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Yes Sir
19/10/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Understood
19/10/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Yes Sir
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Well explained
19/10/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 260 6194: No, i don't
19/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As Winnie's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Winnie is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263712606194 Greetings may I know if we are still connected?
19/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 260 6194: I am so sorry.. Had ran out of data
19/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Yes, please we you can move on
19/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 369 1078: I will own up the obligation by end of this month latest being the 5th of November.
19/10/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Thank you.
30/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Dear Sir, hope I find you well. Just to verify my understanding of payments before I visit the bank this week. Am I right to say that I am supposed to pay $600.for Winie's registration fee to reserve her seat?
30/10/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Winnie.

I hope you are doing well, and had a great weekend, yes please you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $600 to reserve Winnie's seat with the university, however, you are supposed to do that when you receive an offer letter from the university, and we are still awaiting responses from the universities, once we receive any update we shall notify you.
30/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Thank you so much. Have a blessed day
14/11/23, 11:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 11:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Winnie,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 11:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 05:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 11:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 05:30 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
14/11/23, 11:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 369 1078: Good morning Mr Kirti. Today I have space from 8pm.
15/11/23, 12:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Winnie,

I hope you are doing well. I am happy that you were able to acknowledge the offer letter, that is alright please I am looking forward to connecting with you at 08:00 pm today.
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Good evening Sir
15/11/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we can connect now?
15/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Sure
15/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Yes, we can proceed
15/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 369 1078: 1. 900
2. 5yrs
3. 300
4. 750
15/11/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Yes
15/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 369 1078: My question is on hostel fee 2500 / 2000. Does Scholarship reduce that by half as well?
15/11/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me clarify for you. Typically, a scholarship covers only the tuition fees. However, as you are enrolled through Edoofa, we ensure that the cost range we provide you which is $ 2000 - $3000  includes not just your tuition, but also your accommodation and food expenses.
16/11/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 369 1078: Good morning Sir. Thanks for the explanation. As you know that Winie is a less privileged child my concern is to know exactly 'how much I will be expected to contribute per year in total' so that I don't start what I can't finish as her sponsor. So once you are certain of the contribution expected from the parent per year in total let me know.
16/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Winnie.

I hope you are doing well. I shall help you with your concern today. Since we were unable to complete our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
16/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 369 1078: At the moment I am driving. I can only connect for discussion in the evening from 7.30pm
16/11/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand that you must be occupied, however, during the evening we will not be available after 07:00 pm so may I know if you can connect anytime before 07:00 pm?
16/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Let me see if I can create space at 5pm
16/11/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I shall wait for your response.
16/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 369 1078: We can connect 5:15pm I m sure I will be home.
16/11/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I shall be waiting for your response.
16/11/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 369 1078: We can chat Sir
16/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, kindly excuse me it was our dinner break. May I know if you are clear so far?
16/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 369 1078: With tuition I'm clear but with accommodation and food I am not yet clear. It will help me so much if I know exactly the exact amount I will be paying for Winie's education per year. That will help me to budget.
16/11/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming on to that discussion please.
16/11/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 369 1078: I will prefer On campus accommodation for the girl. So my main question was am I going to pay half of the accommodation or I am expected to pay full amount for accommodation. As I have already pointed out that will help me to know what I afford and what I don't afford. I'm afraid to repeat what happened in the past when I assisted another girl and everything changed when the girl was already abroad. She was almost stuck in Cyprus when my contribution was no longer enough to cover her fees and accommodation. That's why I want to be clear with everything before I commit myself
16/11/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand your concern as a parent where you are coming from, if you opt for on-campus you will have to make the payment all at once since it will be an annual deposit and it also includes food. However, it is expensive for our students and hence we prefer our students to opt for off-campus since it is cheaper and students enjoy the freedom of cooking their own meals and since all the students stay near it makes them feel like home away from home.
16/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 369 1078: You know better than I and I am ready to follow your guidance. My biggest concern is not on  the type of accommodation but on my monetary contribution to it. I repeat, I am afraid of accepting responsibility on something that is not well defined in terms of how much will I be paying. The reason being I don't have a salary but I hustle to raise money to pay for education of disadvantaged children.
16/11/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773691078 I completely understand what you are trying to say, however, as we discuss the letter in detail the annual break down will be more clear to you, please.
16/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Thank you Sir.
16/11/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Fine.
16/11/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Yes Sir
16/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Yes Sir
16/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Sure, you may explain.
16/11/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
17/11/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Winnie.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead and complete our discussion today regarding your university letter?
17/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Good afternoon Sir.
I'm busy at work but we can chat. In actual fact the discussion can be answered in one answer. How much money on accommodation am I expected to pay? The whole amount or half the amount? That one answer is enough for me
17/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 08:30 am.
18/11/23, 4:38 am - +263 77 369 1078: Greetings Mr. Kirti. I'm sorry that you had health issues yesterday. Thank God you have recovered. Concerning our discussion, I just have one query which needs clarification. I am very clear with all other things you have explained to us. Only the issue of accommodation payment. I have had what you said that the University offers two types 2000 and 2500. Outside campus it is 1200 and own food. I have understood all that. My one query which I need you as my guide to be honest and straight forward is just to tell me whether I am going to cater for all accommodation and food issues for my girl or there will be some aid from somewhere. That one question addresses the remaining concerns I have. So my request to you is at 8:30 you can answer me on that question. Just send me your response.
18/11/23, 4:54 am - +263 77 369 1078: I am sorry that sometimes I sound as if I am not polite when you request time for discussions. The reason is the nature of my work does not give me time to be on WhatsApp discussions everyday. I am driving most of the time and meeting clients. Like today at 8.30 I have an unmovable session with a client my phone will be on silent until 9.30. By 10am I will be driving out and that means no time for WhatsApp until 2pm. From 4pm I have sessions until 6pm. So in such a day you are left without time for meetings that just pop up daily. Hence when you request a meeting I find space for it and book it. If we can discuss everything in simple, open and straight forward terms that helps me a lot and I appreciate. The reason being I have tight schedules almost every day which makes it very difficult for me to attend to our WhatsApp discussions if they are to come everyday. I really like discussions with you but time limits me.
18/11/23, 8:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Winnie.


I hope this message finds you well. @263773691078 I indeed understand your perspective as a parent, and there's truly nothing to apologize for. We all engage with busy schedules, and navigating the challenges of coordinating across time zones adds an additional layer of complexity. 

We understand the importance of connecting on an individual level and rest assured, we share the same desire. In light of the same, to facilitate our discussion, I would encourage you to share your availability.
18/11/23, 8:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: This way, we can schedule our conversation at a time that suits both of us. Our operational hours from Monday to Friday are from 12:00 PM to 08:00 PM, Zimbabwe time. Given that India is 03:30 hours ahead of Zimbabwe, extending our availability beyond these hours becomes impractical.

However, we recognize that work commitments sometimes hinder parents from connecting during regular hours. In such cases, we are open to extending our availability to weekends as well.
18/11/23, 8:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: Noticing that we haven't been able to connect over the past couple of days, I have personally made myself available to address any concerns you may have and assist you in planning your child's education effectively. Therefore, once you share your availability with us,  we will arrange a suitable time for our discussion. In the meantime, let me address the concern you have in your mind.
18/11/23, 8:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: When you talk about the accommodations, it is important to note that options vary between on-campus and off-campus choices. Some students prefer on-campus housing, while others opt for off-campus arrangements. The decision often hinges on factors such as expenses, available facilities, the community of students, food choices, and other personal preferences. Recognizing the significance of comfort in their chosen environment for higher education, Galgotias University offers students the flexibility to make this choice.
18/11/23, 8:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: On the same note, when you analyze the expenses, students or parents are responsible for covering these costs. However, as you may recall from our initial discussions, the annual cost of a degree education in India typically ranges from $6000 to $8000. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you have qualified for a scholarship on your tuition fee, substantially reducing your overall education costs to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This amount includes not only your tuition fees but also accommodation fees, food costs, and basic amenities such as 24/7 wifi, electricity, and water bills.
18/11/23, 8:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: To simplify the same calculation for you, here is a summary of the fee components we have discussed so far and are mentioned in your letter, providing you with the total expected cost of education at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800
18/11/23, 8:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: This brings your child's per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800 and if you see, this amount of $2800 falls within the range that was shared with you early on. 

With this, now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, I am sure you can see that the entire annual fee after the scholarship is expected to be paid by the student. However, students like you who enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. 

Through the same program, students have the opportunity to scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then use to cover a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 8:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: On the same note, when you analyze the expenses, students or parents are responsible for covering these costs. However, as you may recall from our initial discussions, the annual cost of a degree education in India typically ranges from $6000 to $8000. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you have qualified for a scholarship on your tuition fee, substantially reducing your overall education costs to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This amount includes not only your tuition fees but also accommodation fees, food costs, and basic amenities such as 24/7 wifi, electricity, and water bills.
18/11/23, 9:52 am - +263 77 369 1078: Thank you so much Sir. This all the information I want. It helps me to budget for the girl. I have to put down now her budget for the coming 5yrs basing on the information you have provided. Thank you so much. If I have other questions I will contact you.
18/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 369 1078: On paying the registration fee I first find out possible ways with our banks. If I meet any challenges I will still come back to you.
18/11/23, 10:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that your concern has been answered, may I know if you will be available to connect so that we can discuss the payment plan and modes that we have in mind for you to assist you which is going to reduce your burden as well?
18/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 369 1078: Yes sir, we can chat
18/11/23, 10:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so may I know if you would like to know how this works?
18/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 369 1078: Yes Sir
18/11/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 369 1078: That will be done Sir
18/11/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 369 1078: Sharing with you as my advisor anything within the range of 3000 per year I am able to cover for the education of Winnie and anything above 3500 even if I stretch to the maximum I cannot afford. So right now I begin to plan a budget which will make me raise 15000 for the coming 5yrs. I know God willing I will make it.
18/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 369 1078: Next week before Saturday I will have paid the initial 300 if all goes well
18/11/23, 10:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are so dedicated towards her education be assured that her education will be within $3000 only and not exceed, that. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 10:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 369 1078: In the outskirts of Harare and I do all business in Harare
18/11/23, 10:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 10:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 10:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 369 1078: I stay at Mazowe so Emarald Hill is closer. Thank you. That makes it easier for me then.
18/11/23, 10:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences
18/11/23, 10:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 369 1078: I still have his account details if I consider that option. But at the moment I will pursue Mr Raji option
18/11/23, 11:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the updated account details, if you need them for reference, please.

20/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 71 453 9094: @263773691078 explained everything to me so it's best that we move forward
20/11/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
20/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 71 453 9094: Noted
20/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
20/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
20/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
20/11/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response, however you did not response, since our available hours for today are over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
