12/09/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Arthur,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Arthur's higher education?

I hope you are all fine

I'm sorry I was tied up yesterday.
Today I am available.
17/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Arthur.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright, I understand that you must be busy with work, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Delayed seeing the message 
I'm available now
17/10/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we can connect now. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Before we proceed kindly note that it is Arthur's parent responding. 
Arthur is busy with his studies. 
I will respond on his behalf on what I know.
17/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Considering the career and date of arrival  yes, information accurate. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 338 5382: I'm aware of some of the discussions that transpired. 
Maybe  I might have forgotten some of them.
I have seen the 6 steps and I'm following.
17/10/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. I am glad to hear that you are following. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
17/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Ok
17/10/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with Arthur's university admission process, our main focus will be on completing his scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with his chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for his higher education.
17/10/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
17/10/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
17/10/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
17/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Yes I do agree with you.

May I ask one question pertaining to the career? <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please?
17/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Is there any other opportunity for Arthur to change the career of study under B.Tech?
17/10/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, however, may I know why is that you wish to change his course?
17/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 338 5382: I have been considering the work opportunities of his course and maybe the competition he might have in being considered a candidate.
17/10/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's great that you're considering the work opportunities for his chosen course. Competition can be a factor, but it's also important to remember a successful career can only be made through hard work, which I am sure Arthur does not lack at all, and he will make you proud. However, before considering these reasons may I know if you were able to have a discussion with him about the change of courses?
17/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 338 5382: I haven't discussed with him much I was just exploring some courses and opportunities avaliable locally of different professions.
17/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Having work opportunity in Aerospace engineering might be very minimal in Zimbabwe 🇿🇼.
17/10/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern, I completely understand where you are coming from as a parent, the career opportunity is great and what you are saying is also correct, it has career opportunities however, in Zimbabwe, the opportunities will be minimal in comparison to other countries. And we can always change the course according to your will as we want the best for Arthur as well, however, I would want you to have a discussion with him regarding the same, he should also know about the change of decision in his career field, right?
17/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Thank you very much for your advise.
I will discuss with him.
17/10/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. In that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope by that time you will be able to have a discussion with Arthur and will be available for the discussion tomorrow.
18/10/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Arthur.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Good afternoon 

Time was not on my side today. 
I hope to be able to connect with you tomorrow if all is well.
18/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that you must be occupied, please. However, It is important to note our operational hours, which are from *12:00 PM CAT to 04:00 PM CAT and 07.30 PM CAT to 10.30 PM CAT, Monday to Friday as per Central African Time*. All of our sessions will be held in the same time span, and hence, we kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots.

We have thoughtfully scheduled our discussion sessions within these time frames to ensure engaging and productive conversations. May I assume that you have taken note of our designated discussion hours?
19/10/23, 6:25 am - +263 77 338 5382: Good morning 

Well noted.

Thank you.
19/10/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Arthur.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress?
19/10/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Good afternoon 
I am available now we can continue
19/10/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you were able to have a discussion with Arthur regarding the change of course that you had in mind?
19/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Yes I was able to discuss with him. I gave him time to think about it.
19/10/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, till the time he takes to make his final decision, let us continue with our discussion. So may I know if you are clear so far?
19/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 338 5382: All is clear
19/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 338 5382: It was discussed
19/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2500 to $4000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Yes we are
19/10/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $2600 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $2600 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $3600 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
19/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Noted
19/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $3600 as per the above example.
19/10/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $3600 - $750 = $2850. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1425 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1425 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Very much following 
All is clear
19/10/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/10/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/10/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Well noted
19/10/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 338 5382: You have clearly explained everything, I do not have any queries.
19/10/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I am happy to hear that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
19/10/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
19/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Thank you
19/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
19/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
19/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
19/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 338 5382: I have viewed all of them
19/10/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Arthur, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 338 5382: All sounds good

Following
19/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 338 5382: It does very much thank you
19/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Yes
19/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Following very well no queries so far.
Thank you
19/10/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 338 5382: I will be glad if you provide me with the information
19/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
19/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
19/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 338 5382: From what you have just mentioned above two E grades will give a student 2 points and that will be far from six points for an average pass. Does it mean that you offer such student 100% benefit?
19/10/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query. Let me help you understand when a student attains two E grades, they indeed earn 2 points, which is below the threshold for an average pass. In such a case, the student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship as per our scholarship norms. However, I'd like to draw your attention to an important distinction.
19/10/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When a student reserves their scholarship seat through the Endowment Program, the scholarship percentage doesn't change from the initial 50% and remains unchanged. This means that even if a student doesn't achieve the 6 points required for a 50% scholarship, they would still retain the 50% scholarship they were initially awarded. This offers a significant advantage to students, ensuring they can continue their scholarship opportunity despite a lower academic performance in high school.
19/10/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the event that a student achieves a favorable result in their A-Levels, the university will re-evaluate their application, and based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. So, the scholarship amount can be adjusted upward if the student's performance improves.
19/10/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I hope this clarifies how the Endowment Plan provides students with an edge, ensuring that they have a scholarship opportunity even if their initial academic performance is not at the desired level. It's important to understand that we aim to support students on their educational journey and provide opportunities for growth and improvement.
19/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Ok Thank you for the clarification
19/10/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
19/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 338 5382: True
19/10/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Yes  I do agree.
19/10/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
19/10/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
19/10/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 338 5382: All is clear
19/10/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
19/10/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
19/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Yes I am very clear
19/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
19/10/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Well noted
Thank you
19/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 338 5382: I am clear, no query so far.
19/10/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Arthur's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Arthur is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 338 5382: I am much excited, but I still have to confirm with him about my observations in relation to the career or course he is taking.
I wanted him to be thorough in exploring all the opportunities available.
19/10/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I understand your concern completely, in that case, may I know when can I expect an update from him regarding the course?
19/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Allow me to give him until Sunday.
I don't want him to think I am pushing him to change.
It has to come from him willingly.  If he also decides to change he must have a good alternative career.
19/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I agree with you. That is alright, let us reconnect on Monday at 02:30 pm. I hope you will be available with a update.
19/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 338 5382: I hope all goes well.

Thank you
23/10/23, 8:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Arthur.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our previous conversation may I know if you were able to get an update on Arthur's decision related to the course he wishes to pursue?
25/10/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Arthur,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
25/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Yes I did but he seems to be in a dilemma now.

Courses with better opportunities I had proposed are; civil engineering, software engineering, chemical engineering, etc related to his subjects at A'level.
He is not yet convinced.
25/10/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, may I know if he wants to pursue with the B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering)?
25/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 338 5382: It may appear that way, but I think civil engineering will be better for him. 
Allow me to wait for him.
It looks like I am putting pressure on him to decide on the ideal course if he is to change.
25/10/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, I was occupied with a meeting and my schedule was really tight today at work, let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm. I will be available to connect as I have cleared my schedule so that we can have a discussion.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
01/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 338 5382: Thank you

17/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Okay we can start the discussion
17/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.

17/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Around 07:00pm

21/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 931 0305: Good morning
21/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 71 931 0305: Okay noted
21/11/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

I hope to connect with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
22/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Yes we are together
22/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Well understood
22/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Waiting for this message
22/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Waiting for this message
22/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Yes well understood
22/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Waiting for this message
22/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Waiting for this message
22/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Waiting for this message
22/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Yes
22/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
22/11/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Waiting for this message
22/11/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Waiting for this message
22/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Waiting for this message
22/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Yes it’s clear
22/11/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 30, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
22/11/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
22/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Yes
22/11/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 30, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 30, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
22/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Yes
22/11/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 30, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
22/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Yes it’s clear
22/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Wat are the requirements for civil engineering in the university interms of educational qualifications
22/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For one to pursue Civil Engineering in India, a student must have chemistry, physics, and maths in their A- level.
22/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Okay what are the grades required
22/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: if you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
22/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
22/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Meaning l will be able to do the same course or there will be need for me to change career
22/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263719310305 you will be able to pursue the same course, please.
22/11/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 931 0305: And what if the university rejects the academic results will
22/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 931 0305: they refund me the money to apply to another university
22/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
22/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263719310305 that is when the endowment plan comes to play even after attaining just 2E grades you will be able to pursue your education with a 50%  scholarship, without any concerns.
22/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Okay noted
22/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 931 0305: I stay in Hwange
22/11/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Okay noted
22/11/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/11/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Okay
22/11/23, 9:39 pm - +263 71 931 0305: Okay thank you
22/11/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
22/11/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
