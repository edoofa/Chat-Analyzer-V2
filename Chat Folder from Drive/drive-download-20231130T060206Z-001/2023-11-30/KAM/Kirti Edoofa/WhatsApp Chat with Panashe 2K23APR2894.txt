If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/08/23, 8:45 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes we can start
04/08/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 858 0333: May you please go ahead with the explanations
04/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
05/08/23, 12:08 am - +263 71 858 0333: Very clear
05/08/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 858 0333: At what time? 8.00pm would be ideal for me because network will have improved in the evening.

Please, I hope you are understanding?
25/08/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam understanding
25/08/23, 12:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so may I know by when will you be available for the discussion without any delays?
25/08/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Will be settled in the evening today.

Good day.
25/08/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 08.00 pm I hope you will be available without any delays.
25/08/23, 8:30 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Evening good people.
25/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, may I know if you are able to connect with us now?
25/08/23, 9:18 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Evening.I have been waiting for you since 8pm
25/08/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay in connecting as I was occupied in a meeting. May I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
25/08/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 858 0333: I went through them though l was having some difficulties in getting some of the things that were being said because of the ascent.All the same l will keep on going over them
25/08/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you will be able to share your understanding of the 4 videos?
25/08/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 858 0333: I managed to open the three videos in one video l heard that students should be open minded and be able to follow instructions.


I also heard that students should be quick in taking actionsand be deligent in filing the form and also that the aim of edoofa is not just to see to it that students are educated but also make them employable.

And like l have said before l was facing difficulties with your ascent.Thank.
25/08/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me help understand more. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
25/08/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
25/08/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
25/08/23, 9:59 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Thank you very much for giving me a clearer picture lam going through you response step by step
25/08/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
26/08/23, 5:32 am - +263 71 858 0333: Many thanks Ms Kirti
28/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam available

15/09/23, 5:47 am - +263 71 858 0333: Q3 Economic development is attracting and growing businesses,creating and retaining jobs and making our environments/communities a better place to live.

Businesses contribute to economic development by attracting and growing businesses in strengthening our economy by providing locally manufactured  goods and services.Businesses pay taxes that go to important services like schools,roads,hospitals,fire and the police.Businesses provide good jobs that put money in people's pockets and allow for people to live well.Economic development has a big impact on the places where we live.It retains and attract skilled people and these communities will have a great bright future.

Communities that provide good quality jobs and great places to live are a magnet for people of all ages and thus these places have a strong future

18/09/23, 4:10 am - +263 71 858 0333: Question 4.
I want to highlight on managerial talent / skills.Being a manager means on has to be focussed on whatever you want to do and achieve.lt also means on has to be accommodative of other people's ideas especially when one is working with subordinates.lf you're a manager of your own you will have to be honest with yourself and at the same time hardworking since you will not be having anyone to supervise you to achieve your set goals.

I have been working as my own manager of my father's small poultry project for the past three years though l do it on a part time basis due to school related commitments.l plan the  poultry feeding programme for the month by first budgeting what the chickens need as food.After that lam given money to go and purchase the feed.l make the the poultry feeding roaster and follow the roaster religiously when feeding so as to meet the the target weights.l also do marketing of the poultry products and see whether we are making profit or loss.

Whilst doing all this l will also manage time so that my school work is not affected.l also prepare my reading time table giving each and every subject ample time.l also have time to rest so that whatever l do l will still have a lot of energy.
19/09/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Panashe,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow at 01.00 P.M. I hope this time works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Many thanks for letting us know
20/09/23, 7:25 am - +263 71 858 0333: Marvellous
20/09/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/09/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well and had a fruitful weekend I was hoping to connect with you, however, you did not respond. May I know by when will you be able to complete the academic interview questions and the academic documents?
25/09/23, 4:54 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Afternoon Ms.lam Panashe's father I will talk to him when he comes from school on Friday so that you connect he is a bit tied up with his school work
26/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing that, may I know if you were able to connect with Panashe to complete the tasks?
27/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 858 0333: If lam correct lam only left with typing the fifth interview questions he has already given me the handwritten one.Also he said he will bring his national identity card and the Birth certificate from school and l will send them to you
27/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Good afternoon
27/09/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, may I know when will you be able to share the last academic question as well as the identity proof and O-level results? As the process is delayed already and at the rate we are moving ahead, I can say he will not be able to start with his EWYL program soon. I am concerned as an Admission officer as I do not Panashe to fall behind his peers.

I hope you understand?
27/09/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 858 0333: I will be though with the interview question latest this time tomorrow.As the documents let's say Friday when he comes home
27/09/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what challenges are you facing since you mentioned on 6th September 2023, that you would be able to share the documents within a week, however, now it is the month's end and rather than moving ahead with the process we are delaying it even more for Panashe?
27/09/23, 1:06 pm - +263 71 858 0333: The O level result slip was taken by the Admistrators where he is learning when he enrolled for his lower 6 last year.The authorities didn't give him until l phoned them last week and they said they will give him end of this week.Also l don't know the reasons they were withholding the document
27/09/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm sorry to hear that the administrators took Panshe's O-level result slip when you enrolled for Lower 6 last year. It's definitely disappointing to have to wait so long to get it back, especially when you need it for various purposes. 

Hopefully, you'll receive your result slip at the end of this week as promised. In the meantime since the process is very delayed for Panashe, and we are unable to move ahead with the Admission Process in that case, I will have to have a conversation with the team and see what possible solution they can come up with for Panashe.
07/10/23, 9:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Panashe.

I hope this message finds you well, with regards to our conversation I am here connecting a week later after our desired connecting date, so I would like to inquire if you were able to collect the documents by now?
07/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and a great weekend ahead.
09/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Panashe is at school and lam a bit tied up with invigilation of grade seven exams however we are finishing invigilating today.Iam kindly asking if we can connect tomorrow in the evening.

I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good night.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Please accept my apologies for the delay in connecting as I had a busy schedule at work. I am available to connect now. Are you also available to engage with us at this time?
14/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam a bit tied up l will be available as from 1400hrs.I don't know whether it will work with you
17/10/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Panashe,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you yesterday, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
17/10/23, 11:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Panashe,

I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa.* In the past few days, we've been eagerly awaiting engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received the same amount of enthusiasm to move forward with Panashe's admission process. 

We acknowledge that you were not able to collect the documents on time, despite our consistent efforts of trying to know the reason behind and attend the discussions as per your time and according to the scheduled timings therefore I think there might be underlying reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us on the challenges you're facing. However, your prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.
17/10/23, 11:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program in April 2023, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024. Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage.
17/10/23, 11:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged us to reach out once more, extending an opportunity for you to openly discuss your concerns, which have been hindering your communication with the team. Our aim is to address these issues and provide you with the necessary guidance and solutions. Your participation is vital in ensuring your continued progress in this journey @263718580333 @263714652698 @263715896247 @263772479609.
18/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 71 858 0333: I was having problems with my phone since Sunday and l think l have rectified the problem we can proceed with our process
18/10/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, however, I would first like to know if you were able to collect the academic documents by now for Panashe?
19/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 858 0333: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the O- level result, it is noted with us, may I know by when will you be able to share the statement of entry for A- level for Panashe?
19/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 858 0333: I think l shared with you the statement of entry will repost it when lam back home in the evening.

Afternoon
19/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, it was a technical error, due to which the picture was not downloading however, it has been resolved now, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
19/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Right now lam travelling but l will be able to respond since l will just be seated
19/10/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, please note that we require your presence in the discussion actively for 2 hours, so make sure that you have clear your schedule when we connect.
19/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Since lam travelling there might .be some network challenges along the way so please do bear with me
19/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and that is alright, if you think network can be a challenge while traveling we can connect even during the evening, I just want you to be actively present for 2 hours?
19/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Ok 
Let's make it 9pm.
19/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 09:00 pm
19/10/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to proceed. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
19/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Ok many thanks
19/10/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe he wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course bachelor od business administration for his higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
19/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 71 858 0333: That correct madam
19/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 71 858 0333: That's
19/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
19/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes lam ready.
19/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 71 858 0333: That much l know and since we do not know much about the Indian universities you will assist us in identifying the good ones according to your experience dealing with them
19/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please do not worry about that we will be assisting Panashe, to chose the university according to his perfernce. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 10:20 pm - +263 71 858 0333: What if the child fails to get the minimum no.of points required at Advanced level will the registration fee be refunded or this fee is paid when A level results are out?
19/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 71 858 0333: My phone might shut down any time and since we use solar powered chargers if you see me not responding it might be a result of  power
19/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding. Allow me to clarify the refund policy: If, for any reason, we are unable to provide Panashe an offer letter for higher education, only the $350 Edoofa program fee will be refunded to the parent. However, the focus here is on the admission process for your son. Our organization is committed to ensuring the best for him and we do have a benefit that awaits as we move ahead with our discussions you will understand better.
19/10/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, in that case, we can connect tomorrow when your phone is fully charged, can I anticipate you will be available at 02:30 pm tomorrow?
19/10/23, 10:53 pm - +263 71 858 0333: That will work for me plus tomorrow being Friday it's a half working day on our part so that time lwill be free.

Have a good night
20/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Good afternoon 

Have been waiting since 1430hrs as per our agreement.Can we connect now?
20/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Panashe,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. Thank you for waiting patiently my work schedule was very packed today with meetings, however, we are looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes lam available
20/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
20/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Very clear
20/10/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Well said.l also understand
20/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
21/10/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Panashe.

 I was hoping to get a response from you however it seems like you are not available to respond, your absence has been having a negative impact on Panashe's scholarship, I hope you are aware that the 2024 admissions are now open through Edoofa, and these delays will make panashe behind the peers, which is not a good sign, may I know if we are still connected?
21/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes l have taken note


Because of network challenges lam only seeing messages you sent last night now
21/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Let's connect lam available
21/10/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion however since it is a Saturday today and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
21/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Ok good afternoon.

You only advise of the time on Monday so that l be available
23/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Panashe,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
23/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam available now.

Good afternoon
23/10/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you have taken note of the fee breakup above?
23/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes l have
23/10/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
23/10/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
23/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 858 0333: As per this example it means l will pay for Panashe  in two instalments of $1025 .

If that's the case it's ok
23/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
23/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
23/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
23/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Many thanks for highlighting that
23/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
23/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam understanding all you are saying let's proceed.
Where l will need clarity l will ask
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Evening everyone
26/10/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
26/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam traveling but l can respond to your questions but since lam on transit if you see me not responding it will be due to network challenges
26/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Good evening!
26/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I understand that network can be a challenge. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 858 0333: I have read and understood the benefits
26/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Thank you so much
26/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Panashe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 858 0333: I have read and understood the first step,thank you so much we can proceed.
26/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes it resonates
26/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes please l understand
26/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/10/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/10/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 858 0333: The registration fee from earlier communication l understand it was to be paid in 2 to 4 weeks so it means after the fourth week you will be give another 30 days to pay the other 50% after paying the initial 50%.I stand to be corrected there
26/10/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please once you receive the offer letter from the university, let's say you get the offer letter on the 29th of October, and so the first deadline becomes the 13th of November 2023, making the second deadline the 13th of December, 2023
27/10/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam available madam.
How are you today and Good afternoon
27/10/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am doing great, thank you for asking, I am glad to know that you are available, so may I know if you are clear so far?
27/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 858 0333: As of now everything is clear
27/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied in a meeting, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 7:00 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam available madam
27/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 858 0333: You are very free to shed light on how the process goes on
27/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
27/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 858 0333: I am re reading this article to get an understanding of the whole scenerio.
27/10/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, please take your time to understand better.
30/10/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263718580333 may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam now available  sorry for the delay.

This was caused by circumstances beyond my control
30/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. I understand however, it is past our available hours so let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm?
31/10/23, 3:35 am - +263 71 858 0333: Ok.
My main challenge is in network
31/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Evening madam lam available now
31/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 71 858 0333: We can connect
31/10/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, however, it is past our available hours now, the discussion will not take long if you are available tomorrow at 12:30 pm, please.
01/11/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 858 0333: Many thanks.
I will be available the mentioned time.

Good morning.
01/11/23, 11:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well. with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with Panashe's admissions process without any delays?
01/11/23, 12:52 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam available
01/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 858 0333: We can connect
01/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Afternoon everyone
01/11/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so may I know if you are clear so far?
01/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 858 0333: For the admission it was said one needs to attain 2points at A Level but if l read well in the above posting there is this mention of 6points.thats where lam getting a bit lost.

Iam not saying my son won't get the six points but lam saying at first it was said 2 points were the entry points.
01/11/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please let me help you understand better. Here, what we meant to say is that a student is eligible for a 50% scholarship by just attaining 2E passes through Edoofa, however, if a student achieves a favorable result, like 6 points or more the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

I hope you are clear now?
01/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Ok.  I get you it's now very clear mam
01/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
01/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes l get that.
01/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
01/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Knowing Panashe he will definitely get the 6 points and when the worst comes to the worst he will score slightly less than 6 but far much more than 2points.I have faith in him
01/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed he will make you proud. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
01/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 858 0333: I get that
01/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
01/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
01/11/23, 11:18 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Quite clear
02/11/23, 11:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday, however, by the time you responded it was past our available working hours, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now? <This message was edited>
02/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Let's connect at 1430hrs right lam in a short meeting


Good afternoon
02/11/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please let us reconnect today at 02:30 pm. I hope you will be available.
02/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Afternoon madam and how is your day today?

Can we connect now?
02/11/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Yes, please we can connect now. <This message was edited>
02/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes we can
02/11/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing so may I know if you are clear so far?
02/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 858 0333: We are very clear
02/11/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
02/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 858 0333: That's ok madam
02/11/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Let me go over everything we have discussed and share the same with family members and there after we will proceed.But basically l as an individual have understood
02/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can do that and I am glad to know that you have understood the process well. As Panashe's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that he is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
02/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes lam very excited.
02/11/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
02/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Many thanks madam
17/11/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted

20/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 858 0333: I managed to go through the offer letter but the University hasn't sent me as was said on this platform
20/11/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. As per the update that I had received from the side of the university officials, the letter was already mailed, however, in case if it wasn't due to any reason, you can provide the alternate Email ID to me here and then I can get it mailed again.

21/11/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.

My sincere apologies for not being able to connect earlier as I was occupied in an urgent meeting that demanded my immediate attention. Now that I've resolved those matters, I'm back and ready to continue our discussion.

May I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about your offer letter?
21/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam travelling but will be able to talk with you .

We can connect .Good afternoon
21/11/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, in order to begin with our conversation, please let me know if you have gone through the offer letter by now?
21/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes l have gone through the offer letter
21/11/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
21/11/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
21/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Let me go over it again and give you the answers before day end
21/11/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright, however, we also need to discuss this letter in a clear and quick manner so that you would have ample time to plan the next steps. I hope this is understood?
22/11/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 858 0333: 1.Semester tuition fee after scholarship is usd$900

2.Standard duration for the course is 3years

3.The Admission and procedure fee is USD $300.

4.The registration fee mentioned is usd $750 of which $150 is subtracted leaving me with a balance of $600 which may be paid in two instalments
22/11/23, 9:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
22/11/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 858 0333: A very good morning Sir
22/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 858 0333: Yes on the tuition it's clarified.

Thank you so much
22/11/23, 9:25 am - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
22/11/23, 9:25 am - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
22/11/23, 9:25 am - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
22/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 858 0333: I think as a parent campus accommodation is the most convenient.lt gives a student ample time to concentrate on his/ her studies since all other thing will be catered for by the university
22/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 858 0333: How ever we will keep on evaluating the options after we have sat down with Panashe
22/11/23, 9:34 am - Milan Edoofa: Your perspective is completely right. However, on that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the assurance that you needed, right?
22/11/23, 9:37 am - +263 71 858 0333: If that is the case l can see it's quite cheap to live off campus.
If for $800 one is guaranteed of all the basic needs
22/11/23, 9:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. I would like to mention that the food costs are already factored in with the $800 per annum accommodation costs please. This means that $800 will cover almost everything for you I hope this is understood as well?
22/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 71 858 0333: Well understood sir
22/11/23, 9:56 am - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
22/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 858 0333: Many thanks for sharing sir.
22/11/23, 10:09 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
22/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 858 0333: Yes  lam very clear on that.


Sorry l had taken taken  a short break due to other pressing commitments now lam available
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
22/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 858 0333: On the registration fee where we  are right now.lf l am correct there is this $150 which was removed which fall under the scholarship and the remaining $600 to be paid in two instalments.Is that so l stand to be corrected sir.
22/11/23, 12:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you are correct, and we are coming to that. For now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
22/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes lam clear sir
22/11/23, 12:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
22/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes sir,please explain
22/11/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
22/11/23, 12:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
22/11/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Yes l have understood and lam running around to make sure l raise initial $300 because l will paying in two instalments.
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam sixty km from Harare
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 858 0333: I go to Harare frequenrly
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Ok sir l have taken note of that and l have save his contact.
22/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 858 0333: saved
22/11/23, 12:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
22/11/23, 12:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
22/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 858 0333: You can also provide me with Mr.Kawadza's  banking details so that l have two options
22/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Suppose l fail to raise the $300 is it possible for me to pay whatever l will be having and then pay the rest in the last half?
22/11/23, 12:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
22/11/23, 12:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, you can let us know a week before your deadline date regarding your financial preparations to complete the admission process so that we can discuss and plan more about that in due time. I hope this is understood?
22/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Ok many thanks sir.
22/11/23, 12:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
24/11/23, 6:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Panashe!

I am *Ms. Kirti, Admission Officer at Edoofa*, I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you however, you did not respond., I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet and must be occupied with some work. Could you please confirm if we are still connected?

Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
25/11/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 858 0333: I received the offer letter from the University yesterday 24/11/23 at 0721am.Does it mean that they will count the 15days for the registration fee from that day?
25/11/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. The letter that we shared is the letter is issued by the university and the deadline date is counted from that time, since the university was occupied and was not able to share the letter on time, they shared it with us first so that we could share the same with you. Once a student completes all admission formalities, including the payment of the entire registration fee. If you wish to receive the letter early for visa application purposes, the sooner you complete the entire payment, the earlier we can assist you with the admission acceptance letter and proceed to the next stages of the process.
25/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Ok l understand, so l will pay part of the registration amount on or before the 1st of December
25/11/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
25/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 858 0333: Iam having problems with my network to Google but will try very hard to find more about the university.

Thank you for asking
25/11/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, you can research later when you have time and good network connection. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
