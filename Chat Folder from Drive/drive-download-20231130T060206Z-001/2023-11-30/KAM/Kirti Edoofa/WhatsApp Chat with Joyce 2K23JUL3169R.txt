The most thing ilike is you never leave a student hunging with no one to guide thus mentorship is the special aspect of you I  have loved all the way. <This message was edited>

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
14/08/23, 12:09 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes we can
14/08/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 1:29 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes now you can explain furthermore
14/08/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose
14/08/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/08/23, 1:32 pm - +260 97 7632700: It's clear at the moment
14/08/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/08/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/08/23, 1:36 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes
14/08/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/08/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/08/23, 1:42 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes, I will ask where need raises
14/08/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/08/23, 3:25 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yesl
14/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
14/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
14/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
14/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
14/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
14/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
14/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
15/08/23, 10:31 am - +260 97 7632700: I have gone through all the videos, good morning.
16/08/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joyce.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing your detailed understanding, I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos very clearly and thoroughly.  

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
16/08/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
16/08/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
16/08/23, 3:26 pm - +260 97 7632700: Good morning and how are you.
16/08/23, 3:26 pm - +260 97 7632700: You are too quiet, I will not be available from tomorrow  to Friday, I am traveling to the farm were there would be no network hope you understand.
16/08/23, 4:03 pm - +260 97 7632700: Okay , so does it mean the chances of changing a course are not their
16/08/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, Yes, I understand that completely. May I know why do you wish to change your course now?
16/08/23, 4:14 pm - +260 97 7632700: I  was just asking since my child is at school and I didn't seriously sit to enlighten her on the course  though I updated her, because her dream course has been civil engineer ing but because she is not in the pure sciences class the advise was she can do the course the applied for , but it not serious we have settled on the same course medical laboratory technology
17/08/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joyce.

22/08/23, 10:26 am - +260 97 7632700: Q.4 effective sterilization methods are essential in a laboratory whether researchers are working with deadly viruses, patient blood samples or toxic chemicals.sterilization methods  prevents  contaminants from infiltrating  samples and affecting research outcomes,but they also ensure no microbes, pathogens, or other unwanted matter escapes the lab.
Here are some of the.ost effective methods of sterilization:
1.wet heat or auto claving sterilization - which uses highly pressurized steam
2.filtration sterilization 
3. Radiation sterilization 
 4 . Chemicals/ solvents sterilization 
5.Dry heat( baking or flaming) sterilization
Why they are important -
- it eliminates colony forming units
- to avoid growth of microbes which may grow on the surfaces of an object if left without killing the contaminant.
-it aims to destroy all the life - forms present within a particular laboratory environment.
- to prevent.cross- contamination and provide safe working conditions for laboratory workers.
- it controls diseases by killing the germ, viruses bacteria etc.
- it also minimizes some biological changes on organisms.
- it kills pathogens and prevent spread and  transmission of contaminants.

22/08/23, 12:22 pm - +260 97 7632700: Q4 . Dry heat also known as flaming and baking, sterilization method-dry heat uses intense temperatures to oxidize cellular co mponents and kill microbes,the method calls for more energy than protIen hydrolysis which means any heat sterilization if usually conducted at higher temperatures.Dry heat is a great option for sterilizing equipment or substances that may be damaged if exposed to moisture or that are impenetrable to moist heat e.g powders, petroleum products,sharp instruments the advantage of dry is  that it is non toxic and does not harm the environment.its easy to install a Dry heat cabinet.and has low operating cost,it penetrates materials and is non corrosive for metal and sharp instruments.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
22/08/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*

-lower the cover slowly, avoiding air bubbles.
-remove excess water with the paper towel.
22/08/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelors of Science, in Medical Lab Technology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
22/08/23, 12:52 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes as advised
22/08/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
22/08/23, 1:09 pm - +260 97 7632700: YES
22/08/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
22/08/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
22/08/23, 1:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/08/23, 1:31 pm - +260 97 7632700: What happens with accommodation when students are on   break at the end of a semister especially  those from far away countries, if they don't wish to get back home how are they accommodated do they pay extra cost on accommodation.





 especially
22/08/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand, most of the students prefer to stay and discover new places here in India, and give more time to the EWYL program, however, if a student wants to go back during the end of semester break they can go if finances permit, I would like to inform you that most of our Edoofians stay here, discover places and get to know more about the culture and work more consistently on the EWYL Program through which they can learn skill and earn scholarship credits to further reduce cost. 

Now, if we are clear shall we move ahead?
22/08/23, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes, where are they accommodated, in the schools or what
22/08/23, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7632700: And how about feeding
22/08/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977632700 please I would encourage you to be patient, I understand that as a parent these queries are very common to ask and you would want the best for your child, however, please understand that this counseling discussion is on the University Admission which helps you understand the cost breakdown, since Joyce's year of intake is August 2024, and her registration process will start after August 2023, and once the registration process starts after her offer letter is generated everything related with the accommodation to food will be explained in detail.

I hope we are clear here?
22/08/23, 2:49 pm - +260 97 7632700: Okay fine
22/08/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear here?
22/08/23, 3:08 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes
22/08/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
22/08/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
22/08/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
22/08/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
23/08/23, 10:48 am - +260 97 7632700: Good morning ,ya sorry, I was held up
23/08/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joyce.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright, I understand, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
23/08/23, 12:49 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes
23/08/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear here?
23/08/23, 12:57 pm - +260 97 7632700: Am clear
23/08/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $1200-$1800 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
23/08/23, 1:03 pm - +260 97 7632700: I don't get it on food, accommodation etc, you mean it's not included in that fee <This message was edited>
23/08/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you explain further. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
23/08/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 7632700: Understood
23/08/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
23/08/23, 1:24 pm - +260 97 7632700: Following closely
23/08/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
23/08/23, 1:34 pm - +260 97 7632700: So the schoolarship percentage
Is caculated on the 2050 dollars
23/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query, please note that the above-mentioned figures our just an assumption for your reference and better understanding.
23/08/23, 1:53 pm - +260 97 7632700: Okay noted thank s
23/08/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
23/08/23, 1:55 pm - +260 97 7632700: Okay noted
23/08/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great day.

19/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
19/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
19/10/23, 8:49 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes it's clear but how is it possible to study at multiple university
19/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and that is why we will assist you in selecting the best one according to Joyce's prefernce.
19/10/23, 8:50 pm - +260 97 7632700: Okay understood
19/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
19/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
19/10/23, 9:06 pm - +260 97 7632700: At what point is a 90 percent schoolarship calculated
19/10/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would have love to continue our discussion and answer your query. However, as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
20/10/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Joyce,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
24/10/23, 8:41 pm - +260 97 7632700: Hello how are you
25/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joyce.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/10/23, 7:47 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes lam
25/10/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
25/10/23, 9:15 pm - +260 97 7632700: Didn't answer this
25/10/23, 9:18 pm - +260 97 7632700: I was expecting clearly
25/10/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I am coming on to that, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, such a high quantum of scholarship is calculated by the university which has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels or grade 10 and grade 12 results, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
28/10/23, 3:42 am - +260 97 7632700: So the Adoofa schoolarship and university scholarships are different
30/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joyce.

31/10/23, 6:58 am - +260 97 7632700: Sorry I didn't connect with  you, we had no  electricity, how ever  I meant that do the university calculate a schoolarship based on the schoolarship offered by Adoofa or they follow their own.
31/10/23, 6:59 am - +260 97 7632700: Forgive me sometimes for not being active due some challenges in life.
31/10/23, 7:36 pm - +260 97 7632700: Hello good evening

31/10/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion however, our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
07/11/23, 10:28 pm - +260 97 7632700: Are we there

14/11/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.  Now coming back to your concern, could you please help me with your query, since due to some technical issues, I am not able to go through our old conversation.
19/11/23, 7:54 pm - +260 97 7632700: Do universities follow the same schoolarship percentage  which you have offered or they have there own, I ask because I was given it before choosing the university.
20/11/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @260977632700 

I hope you are doing well, let me help you understand. We at Edoofa, have promised you that we will assist you in getting scholarships from multiple universities and the admissions team will be helping with Joyce's applications so you do need to worry about the universities will be be offering the same quantum of scholarship that you were promised by Edoofa.
20/11/23, 5:40 pm - +260 97 7632700: Good afternoon, thanks,clear
20/11/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now I was able to go through Joyce's documents that you have shared, I would like to inform you that we would need Joyce's grade 10 results and a new letter of recommendation since the letter of recommendation you have shared does not mention her grade 12 subjects.
20/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the the letter of recommendation, we have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process. Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

*Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

*Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level/ grade 12 exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

*Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

*Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.

This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. I hope you are clear with this? <This message was edited>

23/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joyce.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead towards the next step?
23/11/23, 3:54 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes
23/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
23/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
23/11/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level/ grade 12 Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
23/11/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
23/11/23, 10:53 pm - +260 97 7632700: Need clarification on 7
23/11/23, 11:00 pm - +260 97 7632700: What do you mean by 2 passing grades,does it mean you need to pass in all subjects sat for by a 2 grade. Or a distinction
24/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joyce.

I hope you are doing well and this message reaches you in good health. Since we were unable to continue with our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 2:03 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes lam
24/11/23, 2:05 pm - +260 97 7632700: Sorry for the delay, we are running Grade 9 exams, but we can start
24/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, let me help you understand, 2 passing grades, are equivalent to 45% passing marks in grade 12, please and as we discuss the benefits in detail, you will have a better understanding please.
24/11/23, 2:26 pm - +260 97 7632700: Do it practically with the actual subject scores
24/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
24/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, Grade 10 and 12 results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
24/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Joyce, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 7632700: Okay, am  waiting
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through the above explanation of benefit 1
24/11/23, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7632700: I have gone through it
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
24/11/23, 2:45 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes indeed it sounds great
24/11/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
24/11/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/11/23, 3:23 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes it does
27/11/23, 3:28 pm - +260 97 7632700: Add Joyce 0771370508
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - ~ Fossey Mumbika added +260 771370508

27/11/23, 3:46 pm - +260 97 7632700: Thank am well how about you
27/11/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are clear so far?
28/11/23, 9:20 am - +260 97 7632700: Yes
28/11/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joyce.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday?
28/11/23, 1:32 pm - +260 97 7632700: Sorry am a bit busy
28/11/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that you must be occupied with work, may I know by when will you be available to connect?
28/11/23, 10:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
29/11/23, 5:25 am - +260 97 7632700: Sorry that the message I had sent to you did not get to you for whatever reason, I had sent a message telling you that I was held  in a meeting. We will connect today,goodmorning
29/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joyce.

I hope you are doing well, That is alright please, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/11/23, 1:54 pm - +260 97 7632700: Good afternoon, we are fine thanks we can connect
29/11/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
29/11/23, 3:12 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes iam
29/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
29/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/11/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 10, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
29/11/23, 3:15 pm - +260 97 7632700: What if you fail to raise that much even after 10th January according to your example.
29/11/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977632700 if the student/ parent fails to raise the money since the deadline is given by the university the university can revoke the offer letter, however, if you share your concerns with us transparently we can discuss the same with the academic board and if the academic board considers your concern genuine then they can help you with extension.
29/11/23, 3:26 pm - +260 97 7632700: Okay noted and understood thanks
29/11/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level/ Grade 12results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - +260 97 7632700: Educate me please
29/11/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results/grade 12 results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades/ 45% passing marks. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
