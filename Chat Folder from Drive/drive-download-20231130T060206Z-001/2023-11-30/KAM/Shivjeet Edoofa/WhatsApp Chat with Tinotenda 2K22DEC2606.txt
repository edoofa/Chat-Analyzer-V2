09/10/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm pleased to hear that you had a wonderful weekend.

Let's dive right into the session.
09/10/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we commence our discussion, I would like to reiterate an update to you about my operational hours, which span from *2:00 pm to 10:30 pm CAT*. I kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots.

Given our strong enthusiasm and meticulous preparation to advance your admission process, I would greatly appreciate your confirmation of your readiness to embark on this journey. So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
09/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes of course, we can begin the process right away, Thank you very much. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Pharmacy and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
09/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, it is accurate.
09/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry A-Level (If you do not have the A level Results).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
09/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 972 4211: OK, let me send
09/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 972 4211: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 972 4211: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 972 4211: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
09/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, l remember very well
09/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
09/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 972 4211: An offer letter is a document sent by a college or university to a prospective student, confirming that they have been accepted into the school. The letter typically includes important information such as the student's program of study, financial aid package, and important deadlines.
09/10/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, we are surely on the same page.
09/10/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, I am absolutely ready !
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes l have reviewed and understood them and we can continue into discussing them
09/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, l am very delighted by the process we are undertaking in addition to the prestige it carries.
09/10/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Very much Noted !
09/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, indeed it does
09/10/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, l totally understand
09/10/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 972 4211: I have grasped the details so far.  l just want to ask , in the case that l manage to find a university, how much time is there before they start to require their University Registration fee.
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Good afternoon to you too , Mr. Shivjeet. Indeed we çan begin the session.
10/10/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please do not worry about that right now you will be given a time of 15 days up to 30 days to clear the fees. May I know if you are clear here?
10/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, l am clear. Thank you very much.
10/10/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 972 4211: I will be glad if you are to provide more information on the subject
10/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 972 4211: The details were so precise understandable, everything is now clear, thank you very much.
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, l am in agreement
10/10/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, everything is clear, thank you.
10/10/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Very clear indeed, Thank you.
10/10/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Very much Noted !
10/10/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Not at least for now
10/10/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
10/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes l am keenly waiting for it
10/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
10/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 972 4211: OK, that is Noted.
10/10/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
10/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 972 4211: OK, Thank you very much for your service and unwavering support.
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tinotenda.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by MVN University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!

15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 972 4211: Good Morning Mr. Milan. How are you ?

I am  excited and honored that my application was accepted, all thanks to your unwavering support and commitment. 

Thank you very much
16/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 972 4211: Very much Noted ! Will surely be present for our discussion today.
16/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Good Afternoon Mr. Milan Singh. I am now ready for our discussion.
16/10/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
16/10/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
16/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 972 4211: 1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship? - $1000
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship? - $0
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship? - $2250
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable) - $125
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat? - $575
16/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 75% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 25% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $1000.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
16/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes, indeed it is such a privilege. Thank you very much
16/10/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 357 9046: Waal. As parents to Tinotenda we are very much excited! Actually we can't find words to really express how we feel right now. 
Thank you very much
17/10/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $2250 + $250 = $2500.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $2250. I hope you are clear about that?
17/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 633 5149: Good afternoon mr Milan
17/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 633 5149: Yes, it's  clear thank you very much for clarification.
17/10/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure - 

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
17/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 633 5149: Yes , indeed.
17/10/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/10/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 633 5149: Very clear
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $2250 and so the balance fee becomes $2250 - $1000 = $1250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
17/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 357 9046: That would be wonderful! The remaining balance will be affordable and more comfortable
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $2500, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2500 - $1000 = $1500.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
17/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 633 5149: Very clear
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $1000  to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$425 before 29th October 2023.*
2. *$425 before 29th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $850 within 15 working days by *29th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
18/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 357 9046: Thank you very much for the information. We are very grateful especially for the grant. We can pay in two parts ie. $425 this month and the other next month.
Thank you for making payment more flexible.
18/10/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 357 9046: We are residing in the city of Gweru which is in Midlands province
18/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 357 9046: Ok thanks
18/10/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 357 9046: Ok. However l am a bit lost hear. May you help me
18/10/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: If I may ask what is it that you are not able to understand here please?
18/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 357 9046: $2250 or $3000
18/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 357 9046: Ok. Off campus fee.
Thanks
18/10/23, 4:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you are now clear about the same please?
18/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 357 9046: Ok. $2250 highlighted before does not include accommodation?
19/10/23, 4:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Good Afternoon to you too Mr. Milan Singh. 

The time has been very much *Noted*, and our availability is certain.

Thank you very much
19/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 972 4211: No questions as of yet and yes , you can share the university insights with us

19/10/23, 11:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
19/10/23, 11:30 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Very much Noted. At what time will we be holding our discussion tomorrow?
19/10/23, 11:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Around 01.30 PM dear. Until then have a blessed night!
19/10/23, 11:31 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Thank you very much.
20/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Good Afternoon Mr. Singh
20/10/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from MVN University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a family yet?
20/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 633 5149: Yes we discussed and understood it.
20/10/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 357 9046: Sorry for a delayed reply.We are experiencing network challenges.

Otherwise our discussion as a family was very positive. It was an opportunity for us all to be at the same level of understanding especially the offer letter. Family members are so excited and supportive.
We also got the opportunity to discuss and adjust our budget so that we pay fees. Considering our financial muscle we realized that we can pay admission fee in two months consecutively.
As a family we committed ourselves during our discussion to honour our financial obligations promptly.
Thank you very much.
I hope l find you well
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Thank you very much Mr. Singh.

 I want to ask if the fee for  meals is also incorporated in the total costs .

Also another question. Earlier this year we paid an enrollment fee, Does that amount affect the registration fee or otherwise the total tuition fee.
20/10/23, 9:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding the food, they are not incorporated in the total costs. Now, if all the students residing together will prefer self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please. 

Moving ahead, the enrollment fee that you had paid was for Tinotenda to become a part of the Edoofa Program and get access to the scholarship, therefore it won't be a part of the university fee.
20/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 972 4211: That is very much Noted, thank you. I believe we can now proceed further as you said.
20/10/23, 9:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of the admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 972 4211: Yes indeed l have , and l will be glad to share with you some
20/10/23, 9:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please do that dear. What are the queries?
