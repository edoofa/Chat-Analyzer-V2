03/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Tuesday(10th October) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Tuesday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
03/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?

03/10/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
03/10/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Mbuso 2K23SEP2424)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
03/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Mbuso EWYL23E0768)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
03/10/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Ok thats is fantastic, thank you
03/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes madam, quiet clear
03/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 294 7757: But exams are starting a weeks time for Mbuso hence he wont be available online, what will happen then??
03/10/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect your exams, which are scheduled to begin on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, you can enhance your study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit your performance in the upcoming exams.

However, it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and your exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled, that parents can actively participate in. <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. hence, if Mbuso is occupied with school, you on his behalf are free to get started, and we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program
03/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Thats perfect then, thank you
03/10/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now if you are clear shall we move ahead with the session ?
03/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes, we can move ahead
03/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

03/10/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's a great observation, and we're glad you've highlighted the significance of the Earn While You Learn program. Indeed, it's a unique aspect of the Edoofa Scholarship Program that not only supports the students financially but also instills a sense of responsibility and work ethic.

The program is designed to offer a balance between academic pursuits and practical experience, empowering students like Mbuso to contribute to their education while gaining valuable skills and experiences. It's wonderful to see your understanding of the program's potential impact on Mbuso's personal growth and future success.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Lets start
04/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

04/10/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are yet to start the steps, dear. Shall we now proceed?
04/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes, lets go in ahead
04/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
04/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes they are clear
04/10/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sorry to say that I will not be further available to proceed with our session for now, as unforeseen work has come up that requires my assistance. Let us connect tomorrow evening at 8:00 PM. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Noted, thank you,
04/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Good evening
05/10/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Mbuso!

How are you doing this lovely evening?
05/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Good evening 
Im doing very well thank you
05/10/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. If you are ready, shall we proceed with the session?
05/10/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes, lets do it but network is a bit slow
05/10/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is well noted. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
05/10/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
05/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yeap, im following
05/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
05/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
05/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 294 7757: If i may ask..
When are they likely to start university??
05/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Who writes the SOP for us?
05/10/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your intake will commence in the month of August 2024. Regarding the SOP, the student will be the one writing the SOP with guidance from us.
05/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Ooh ok tts good, thnx a lot
05/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
05/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes we can do that
05/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
05/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
05/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes plz do share

05/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for informing me about the network issues. I understand that downloading videos can be a challenge with a weak network. In that case, shall we schedule our session for tomorrow at 5:00 PM?

06/10/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
06/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Ok tts fyn

06/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 294 7757: V2 talks abt the what they ecpect of their students, their characters, behaviours from the rest of other students

V3 the founders are talking abt journey on how they go about to get connected with schools to get students and what the students go through in their schools before university 

V4thus video talks about the statement of purpose, the step.towards securing good scholarship, why the Statement of purpose is important
06/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
06/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
06/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
06/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
06/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes we are on the same page
06/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
06/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 12:00 PM.
06/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

3. Please share your understanding of GAAP and its importance
GAAP- Generally accepted accounting principles
These are a collection of commonly followed accounting rules and standards for financial reporting.
It is important in that it ensures that investors are not led astray by misleading financial statements. It also ensures that all financial statements are compiled in an accurate, ethical, and honest manner.
4. What are accounting standards and why are they mandatory
Accounting standards are authoritative standards for financial reporting and are the primary source of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
Accounting standards specify how transactions and other events are to be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in financial statements.
5. Please differentiate between Accounting and Auditing.
Accounting is the daily process of recording financial transactions, managing data, and maintaining records. 
Auditing is a periodic process that focuses on ensuring the accuracy and legality of financial statements.

07/10/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
07/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yeah i think tts the time im not so very sure
07/10/23, 2:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As per my records that I have it is indeed 2024.
07/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes, thats it
07/10/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
07/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes im ready
07/10/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since it is the weekend I would like you to know I will be closing our session as for now. And I will connect with you on Monday at 5:00 PM have a great weekend and warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/10/23, 6:00 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Thank you so much, have yourself a lovely weekend
09/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?

I am doing great, thank you for asking.
09/10/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Good evening 

Yes, we had a great weekend thank you..
Sorry for the late responce i was driving home from work..
Yeswe can resume with our session, im home now
09/10/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
09/10/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
09/10/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
09/10/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
09/10/23, 6:47 pm - +263 77 294 7757: So fees would be paid on a annual basis? Please clarify here..
09/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yeap, its not practical for such to happen
09/10/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes that is absolutely correct.
09/10/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
09/10/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
09/10/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes they did discuss about this registration fee
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes, we are on the same page
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
09/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 294 7757: And when making payments, how will this fee be broken down or its a once off payment made in one installment??
09/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It will be required to make the payment in one lump sum within a period of 2 weeks. Please do not worry about it right now. You will be provided with the notice about the deadline so that you can plan your finances in advance. May I know if you are clear here?
09/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Ok, noted thank you
09/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
09/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
09/10/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and let's connect tomorrow at 5:00 PM. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
09/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Make me understand here, wat was the 350us for??
When i paid i was told its for reserving my seat, and now the 750us is also for reserving my seat, how many times do i reserve a seat??
09/10/23, 11:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I shall answer your questions tomorrow, In the meantime. Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Mbuso EWYL23E0768*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/KQV0PusSuRZ58VKUOVB5gj"
09/10/23, 11:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Mbuso Ndlovu and my EWYL group name is Mbuso EWYL23E0768.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
09/10/23, 11:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
10/10/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Thank you for sharing the name of your mentor. If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Good evening 

Thnk u very much
We can continue
10/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding your concern, let me help you understand the same. For the fees of $350 was for the Edoofa enrollment program, for you enrollment into the program.
10/10/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: And The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, constitutes a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
10/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Well understood thank you
10/10/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
10/10/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
10/10/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
10/10/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
11/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Greetings 
Yes, we can begin with our session
11/10/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

11/10/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
11/10/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Im done reviewing
11/10/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/10/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/10/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
11/10/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Waal this is amazing
11/10/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 294 7757: This explains a lot, im so grateful
11/10/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
11/10/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes it does thanks
11/10/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/10/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/10/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Im following, 
Is it registration fees should be paid when we get offered a place
11/10/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct. It will be required to pay once you have received the offer letter from the university.
11/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Ok.that is so good
11/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 294 7757: But for now Mbuso has no passport and we intend to secure one as soon as he comes home from school
11/10/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's great that you're planning to secure one for Mbuso as soon as he returns from school.
11/10/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
11/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Please provide more information
11/10/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
11/10/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
11/10/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
11/10/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
11/10/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Would you explain further 🤔
11/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To keep their scholarship and continue their Bachelor's degree, they need to get at least two passes, which are like getting two E grades. This is a requirement to maintain the scholarship.

However, if a student hasn't done well in their A-Levels and hasn't even achieved 6 points, they won't meet the criteria for a 50% scholarship as per the scholarship rules. In simpler terms, if they don't meet the minimum grade requirements, they won't get the scholarship.
11/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Ok, thats understandably
11/10/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
11/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Ok i see thath
11/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/10/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
11/10/23, 10:40 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Thnk you, good evening
12/10/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” – Nelson Mandela*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session. 

If you are available for the session shall we begin?
12/10/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Good day,yes please we can continue
12/10/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
12/10/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
13/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
13/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Good evening 
We can proceed
13/10/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
13/10/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 294 7757: All.clear thank you
13/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Mbuso's  guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Mbuso is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
13/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yea we are excited and rearing to go forward to receiving our offer letter
13/10/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Mbuso's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
13/10/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Thank you noted
17/10/23, 11:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mbuso,

If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes, im looking forward to our discussion, my network is very poor though
18/10/23, 10:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. We understand that network issues can sometimes be a challenge. We will do our best to ensure a smooth discussion despite any potential network difficulties. With that said, now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 10:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
19/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Greetings
19/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 294 7757: 1. Annual tuition fees2500us
2. Hostel fees per year- 1200
3. Registraion fees -750us
19/10/23, 8:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, parents and Mbuso,

I hope you are all in good health and high spirits. I was expecting a response from you yesterday evening at our scheduled time, but it seemed that you were unavailable, which prevented us from starting our discussion.

Could you please inform us if there were any issues or challenges that made you unavailable for our conversation? This will help us understand the situation better and reschedule our discussion accordingly. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Good evening

I think i highlighted that my network was verybad last night
19/10/23, 10:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 294 7757: It is very clear
19/10/23, 10:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As assumed above, with these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2200. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2200 - $1000 = $1200, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
19/10/23, 10:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
19/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Yes, itdoes
19/10/23, 10:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
19/10/23, 10:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2200 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after you arrive in India will be $2075 - $750 = $1450. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $725 and $725, with a six-month gap between them.
19/10/23, 10:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of your arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
20/10/23, 5:46 am - +263 77 294 7757: Greetings 🙏 yes, this is very clear n understandeable
20/10/23, 7:52 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning to you as well @263772947757. 

Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as October 31st, 2023*. <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 7:53 am - Vilsha Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you are aware that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/10/23, 8:00 am - +263 77 294 7757: Yes please do
20/10/23, 8:00 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/10/23, 8:00 am - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/10/23, 8:12 am - +263 77 294 7757: All clear thnx
20/10/23, 8:16 am - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, I would also like to move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 8:16 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 8:20 am - +263 77 294 7757: Driving to work now
20/10/23, 8:27 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, and thank you for sharing this information, @263772947757. Please drive safely to your workplace. Once you are available to resume our discussion, please go through our previous messages and address them. After that, we can move forward.

With that said, could you please let me know the estimated time when you will be able to reconnect? This will help us adjust our schedule accordingly.
20/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Good day

Im now available, we can continue with our session
20/10/23, 7:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to you as well @263772947757. 

Thank you for the confirmation. With regards to our last conversation, now that we are clear with the payment plan, I would also like to move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 7:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 294 7757: I reside in Bulawayo
20/10/23, 8:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 8:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 8:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Mhm, that's a difficult issue now..

I will try to get in touch with him
20/10/23, 9:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, it is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.

Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
20/10/23, 9:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 294 7757: I think this is a better option bcz for me to go to harare, which becomes expensive
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly @263772947757. If that was a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
24/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Greetings
26/10/23, 9:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Mbuso,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
26/10/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Good evenings, its fyn quiet understood
26/10/23, 9:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for understanding @263772947757. I am glad to hear that you will be available tomorrow at 8 am. We look forward to our discussion and will be ready to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. If you have any specific topics or questions you would like to address during our discussion tomorrow, feel free to share them here in your admission group overnight, and we will make sure to cover them tomorrow.

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by the Gulzar Group of Institutes. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutes as a collective?
30/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Greetings to you all
Yes we did look into the offer letter
30/10/23, 3:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is wonderful and reassuring to hear that you have had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that your family must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
30/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 294 7757: As a family we are so excited and looking forward to Mbuso's journey for high education in India
30/10/23, 4:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I see @263772947757 and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for Mbuso. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
30/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 294 7757: on the offer leeter, the bank name that im supposed to send money into is different from the one which i sent money to, wont that be a problem for us
30/10/23, 4:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing, @263772947757. However, to ensure that I interpreted your message correctly, I would appreciate it if you could clarify your message or provide more details. This will help me address your concerns more effectively.
30/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 294 7757: the beneficiary name on the offer letter is Anhad Edutrain Solutions  where I'm supposed to deposit the registration fees whereas i deposited the funds into a diferent account. wont that be a problem for us?
30/10/23, 5:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: @263772947757, if I am understanding you well, I believe you have already made the payment of your university registration fee. If yes, could you please share the payment receipt for the same so that I can check and help you from a better perspective?
30/10/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 294 7757: my brother was supposed to pay today soo im sure i will get the receipt when i get home '

30/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 294 7757: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 5:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I appreciate your understanding, @263772947757. The account details in the offer letter are indeed meant for international transfers, and to simplify the process for our students in Zimbabwe, many prefer to work through our local associates. When you or your brother make the payment to these local associates, they will subsequently transfer the funds to the international account mentioned in the offer letter. Our dedicated accounts team at Edoofa will ensure that the payments are duly recorded and sent to the university according to the student's application. Your part as a parent in the payment process is complete once you have paid the local associate, and we will take care of the rest. I hope this clarifies any concerns you had?
30/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 294 7757: Ok tts quiet understandable thank you

Remember, we are here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process.
