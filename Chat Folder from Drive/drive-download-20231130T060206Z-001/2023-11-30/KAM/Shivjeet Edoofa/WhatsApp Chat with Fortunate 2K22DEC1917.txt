With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Greetings to you sir
10/10/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes we can proceed
10/10/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
10/10/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 5:44 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes you lastly asked me to send you my details so that they can help you in my university admission
10/10/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
10/10/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Well l understood that you help me apply in different universities then l chose from the universities that would offered me an acceptance letter
10/10/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 818 8500: I hope it's correct
10/10/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
10/10/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
10/10/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 818 8500: We are very excited sir
10/10/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes sir we are
10/10/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
10/10/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 818 8500: So sir l wanted to ask
10/10/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: yes please go ahead
10/10/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 818 8500: I wanted to say the fee that l pay for my for y studies abroad like the 2000usd is it for my whole course there in India
10/10/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that will be your total cost for each year, and you will be provided with more details in the time you receive your offer letter, which will show you the exact numbers.
11/10/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 818 8500: Ok sir thank you
12/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
12/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 818 8500: This is interesting
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes sir
12/10/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/10/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes sir
12/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes sir
12/10/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 818 8500: You can provide me with more information sir
12/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
12/10/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes sir l am clear
12/10/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/10/23, 6:59 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Okay
12/10/23, 6:59 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Sounds interesting
12/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/10/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes sir
12/10/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
12/10/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes sir
12/10/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/10/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/10/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes sir l have a question
12/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 818 8500: I wanted to ask the annual fee that  l will be paying is it for my whole course like until l finish my bachelor's degree or l pay it annually
12/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 818 8500: For instance if a persuing a degree for 4years the fee that l pay will it cover up
12/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your question, and it's an important one. The fee structure typically varies depending on the university and the program you choose. Generally, the annual fee covers one academic year of study. For instance, if you're pursuing a bachelor's degree that takes 4 years to complete, you would pay the annual fee for each of those 4 years.
12/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Okay sir thank you
12/10/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
13/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

18/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 818 8500: No problem ma'am thank you it's just that l have been busy with exams
18/10/23, 5:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand @263788188500 and thank you for sharing the update regarding your exams. However, it is important for you and your family to understand the next steps well, particularly the information about the offer letter and the associated due dates. it is crucial to adhere to these timelines, given that they affect the completion of your admission formalities.

Our goal is to initiate a detailed discussion on the offer letter as soon as possible so you can fully comprehend the admission process and make well-informed decisions regarding your education
18/10/23, 5:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In such a case, since it's important for you to focus on your exams, and the offer letter also holds a priority, what we can do is, if your parents are available, we can reconnect with them in the evening to discuss the offer letter right here in your admission group. 

Then, whenever you find some time in your schedule, you can go through the discussion we had, understand the letter better, and catch up with us. This way, you won't be left behind, and you will be in a position to share your thoughts and ask any questions you might have. We can then reconnect on Friday/Saturday to ensure we are all on the same page. What are your thoughts on this solution?
18/10/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 818 8500: In the evening l will be available
18/10/23, 6:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Fortunate. In that case, let us reconnect with each other at the scheduled time, we are looking forward to our discussion.
18/10/23, 7:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Fortunate,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 7:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
19/10/23, 7:18 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Good evening to you all
19/10/23, 7:25 pm - +27 64 495 8091: Greetings to you all
19/10/23, 7:26 pm - +27 64 495 8091: I wanted you to explain to us the costs on the letter
19/10/23, 8:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, parents and Mbuso,

I hope you are all in good health and high spirits. Thank you for reaching out and I have taken note of the message you shared. However, I was expecting a response from you yesterday evening at our scheduled time, but it seemed that you were unavailable, which prevented us from starting our discussion regarding your offer letter.

Could you please inform us if there were any issues or challenges that made you unavailable for our conversation? This will help us understand the situation better and reschedule our discussion accordingly.
19/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Network here in Zimbabwe is very difficult
19/10/23, 9:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I see @263788188500. Network challenges can be expected during the rainy season, and I completely understand. We will work around these challenges and adjust our discussions as needed.
19/10/23, 9:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, given the time difference between India and Zimbabwe, our operational hours are typically scheduled from 08:00 am to 04:00 pm CAT. We recognize that parents sometimes have work commitments or they are unavailable to connect due to network challenges during the day.
19/10/23, 9:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Therefore, we occasionally extend our availability and schedule operational hours in the evening to assist parents promptly. However, I am sure you understand that this might not be feasible every day.
19/10/23, 9:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For today, I can certainly accommodate and connect with your family, but since it is quite late, 12:00 AM here in India, we can only stretch our conversation for another hour. However, since we are scheduling this discussion specifically for you and your family, can you please confirm if the network is stable and if you are actively available?
20/10/23, 2:23 am - +263 78 818 8500: My sincere apologies Sir I am just receiving your messages now
20/10/23, 10:01 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, Fortunate, I completely understand, and it is perfectly fine. However, I would like to express a concern. As you are aware it has been over two days since we shared the offer letter with you, but due to the challenges at your end, we haven't been able to make any progress in discussing the offer letter.

As time continues to pass, the due dates set by the university draw nearer, leaving us with fewer days to complete your university admission formalities. Hence, I am genuinely concerned that this delay might jeopardize your scholarship opportunity.
20/10/23, 10:02 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, to address this concern, it is essential for you and your family to have a clear understanding of the next steps, particularly regarding the offer letter and its associated due dates. It is critical to adhere to these timelines, as they significantly impact the completion of your admission formalities.

Our goal is to initiate a detailed discussion on the offer letter as soon as possible so that you can fully comprehend the admission process and make well-informed decisions regarding your education.
20/10/23, 10:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Therefore, in the meantime, if you are unavailable due to network issues and considering the offer letter's priority, we can schedule a discussion with your parents right here in the admission group, as we previously discussed. Later, once you have access to a stable network, you will be able to follow through with the discussion and share your thoughts. This way, you won't miss out on crucial information. What are your thoughts on this proposed solution?
20/10/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Good evening sir can we continue with the discussion today l am available
20/10/23, 7:34 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Sir can you explain the offer later for like every thing in detail about the payments
20/10/23, 7:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @263788188500, thank you for your confirmation. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
20/10/23, 7:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
20/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes we can proceed
20/10/23, 7:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. Now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
20/10/23, 7:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s Fortunate's per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
20/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 818 8500: 1.900usd
2.3years
3.300usd
4.750usd
20/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 818 8500: So sir on these amounts has edoofa deducted it's percentage
20/10/23, 8:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses and let me help you understand the same @263788188500. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling six semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Okay
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Can you explain further more
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased that we have been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 818 8500: So let's say sir it will now be 1800usd +2000 USD if l opt for 3 seater room
20/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, that is correct @263788188500, if you are considering the on-campus, the same calculation is correct. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation and were able to take note of the same.
20/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically.
20/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Okay sir
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 818 8500: We can proceed
20/10/23, 9:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. Continuing the discussion regarding your offer letter, now as you can see in the offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
20/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Okay we can proceed
20/10/23, 9:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to Yvonne's overall cost of education.
20/10/23, 9:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
20/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes we are together
20/10/23, 9:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263788188500. Now in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works? <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes
20/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 818 8500: You can explain
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Okay sir thank you for your explanation
20/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 818 8500: So if l pay the registration wat about the rest of the amount when do l pay that
20/10/23, 9:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, I would also like to move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 9:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes we are in harare
20/10/23, 9:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 9:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 9:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Thank you sir
20/10/23, 9:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/10/23, 9:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Lastly sir so will l also get offer letters from other universities
20/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Yes sure
20/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Thank you very much sir for your time and help .l appreciate it.
Have a blessed night
20/10/23, 9:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. If that was a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
24/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Good evening to you sir
24/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 818 8500: I have a few questions l would need your assistance
26/10/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Evening sir
26/10/23, 8:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Fortunate,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the message you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 8:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 8:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 8:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
27/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Evening to you sir
27/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Fortunate. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I am Mr. Shivjeet, it is nice to connect with you again. How are you doing this lovely evening?
27/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 818 8500: I am doing well sir thank you
27/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 818 8500: How do you do
27/10/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. As I was going through the conversation that you had with Ms. Visha, I have noticed that you have some questions that you would like to ask, and I am more than happy to answer those questions. So, may I know what concerns you would like to share with me?
27/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Thank you sir
27/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Well l wanted to understand wat the 600usd covers for me
27/10/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, let me help you here. The $600 will cover your registration for your university applications, and please note that this is not an extra amount that you will be paying. With the total, which is $750, including the $150 from the grant, you will be able to subtract it from the first-year tuition fees. May I know if you are clear on this?
27/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 78 818 8500: So there is no visa application  assistance on that amount
27/10/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm delighted by your proactive approach, which demonstrates your genuine interest in pursuing higher education. Allow me to guide you through this process. The VISA fee amounts to $83 and must be submitted directly to the embassy by either the student, parent, or guardian. It's worth noting that this visa fee is a one-time payment and remains valid throughout your entire higher education journey in India. This falls within the scope of additional expenses that you'll be responsible for. I hope we are on the same page here?
27/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Okay sir
27/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 818 8500: So much can l budget for the flight there
27/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 818 8500: So did l only get a scholarship from one university
27/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy that you are active in our conversation and interested in this amazing concern. Surely, let me help you proceed with the first question here. So, regarding your concern about the flight cost, it will be an amount of around $400, and it will be a one-time investment only that you have to make until you decide to come back. Also, let me help with an interesting thing as well: the flight ticket and the visa process will be well-guided with us when the time is near, with every step of the process, ensuring a smooth and seamless procedure for the same. Please let me know if you are clear with me.
27/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Okay
27/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the response, now coming to the second concern. As you know Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
27/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As of now, Fortunate's application has been accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I hope we are together with this?
27/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Okay sir
27/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 818 8500: Sir I was kindly requesting if l could pay the 300 usd on the 09 November
27/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that the amount can be quite challenging. However, I would be glad to address your concerns and help you with this as we proceed with the session. So, I would like to continue our session for the same. If you are ready, shall we move on?
27/10/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected with each other so that we can proceed further with the session for the discussion of your prestigious offer letter, and we can hopefully conclude our session for the day?
