03/11/23, 4:19 pm - +27 83 499 2115: On sponsor we are not sure of what to write since we are applying for sponsorship through you. So we didn't know what to write.
As for the photo my apologies let me rectify that
03/11/23, 4:21 pm - +27 71 622 8502: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here @27834992115. I completely understand that Valentine is preparing for his exams, in the meanwhile, if I may ask, are you willing to proceed with our discusssion here please?

04/11/23, 10:57 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, when it come to this query of yours, I would like to mention that the Sponsor Details that you have to mention in your counseling feedback form are the details of the person who would be supporting Valentine's higher education after the support you will get from the side of the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
04/11/23, 11:13 am - +27 83 499 2115: Ok what if we dont have such a person. And all the responsibilities lie within the family?
04/11/23, 11:15 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I beleive you as parents would be supporting Valentine in his higher education, right?

I hope you are doing well today. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: @27834992115 I believe as per the discussion that we had here earlier, you must have corrected Valentine's Counseling Feedback Form and made it ready for submission. On that note, can you please let me know if you were able to do that by now so that we can now proceed with our discussion regarding Valentine's admission process? <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 3:46 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Good afternoon. I think this message is lost this is Valentine's group
06/11/23, 3:46 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Oh I see it's been corrected.
06/11/23, 3:47 pm - +27 83 499 2115: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing, thank you for sharing the forms with us, I have taken a note of these and will update them in our records as well.
06/11/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion? <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 4:15 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Thank you, you can share  the admission process please
06/11/23, 4:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 4:43 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Thank you for the information. You can explain it in detail. As of now I'm not really sure the stage we are at
06/11/23, 6:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
06/11/23, 6:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
06/11/23, 6:28 pm - +27 83 499 2115: The above are very clear
06/11/23, 6:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
06/11/23, 6:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
06/11/23, 6:31 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Yes I am following, I believe it is clear
06/11/23, 6:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL). <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 6:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/11/23, 6:46 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Thank you for the clarity. So the 500 is to be paid by the student as well.
06/11/23, 6:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: You're welcome, and I appreciate your attentiveness. Regarding the registration fee, yes, the student is responsible for paying the registration fee to the university to secure their seat. It's an important step to confirm your intention to join the university. Once the registration fee is paid and you receive your Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), the next steps, including the Visa application process, will be coordinated with the guidance of the admission team to help you successfully enroll in the university.

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

I am not scared to partake this journey because it is not only family and myself that is looking forward for maximum success but I have full support from Edoofa as well. I leant that it is also my duty to be teachable and be open minded for me to enjoy this great opportunity. Edoofa has spent about a *decade*investigating the best schools and higher education for its students and that is for me true dedication in improving people's lives.  I also enjoyed the stories of other Africans who are actually making it in life through Edoofa and hence bringing smiles to the Edoofian family. I wish to be one of those dedicated people who will maximize the happiness of the Edoofian family. <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 6:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear about your enriching experience from the videos.

14/11/23, 7:44 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Is it possible for us to continue with our sessions next week when Valentine is free, this week he is swamped with exams,
14/11/23, 7:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that, however as I have already mentioned as well that you can continue with us here for the discussions till the time Valentine is available. Therefore, can we do that?
14/11/23, 8:07 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Yes we may
14/11/23, 8:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, can you please also share Valentine's A-Level and O-Level Results with me here so that we can proceed with the discussion here.
14/11/23, 8:52 pm - +27 83 499 2115: In South Africa there isn't any O or A level. There is only Matric. And  he is currently writing his matric exams.
14/11/23, 8:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, you can share Valentine's Grade 10 and Grade 12 results please. In case of Grade 12 Results, you can share the SOE as well. I hope this is understood?
14/11/23, 8:57 pm - +27 83 499 2115: May I please know what an SOE is
14/11/23, 8:58 pm - +27 83 499 2115: For Grade 12 do I send his 3rd term results?

I hope this message finds you well.

As per our previous conversation, I wanted to confirm our scheduled session for today, which is set to resume. I'm looking forward to continuing our discussion about your university admission journey, are you ready for that?
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Yes we may continue

15/11/23, 2:54 pm - +27 71 622 8502: <Media omitted>

15/11/23, 3:12 pm - +27 71 622 8502: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Valentine, please share a clear picture of your Grade 10 as well.
15/11/23, 3:15 pm - +27 71 622 8502: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:18 pm - +27 71 622 8502: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
15/11/23, 4:06 pm - +27 83 499 2115: This is accurate
15/11/23, 6:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
15/11/23, 6:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
15/11/23, 6:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
15/11/23, 6:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
15/11/23, 6:27 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Very true sir
15/11/23, 6:27 pm - +27 83 499 2115: This is understood
15/11/23, 6:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
15/11/23, 6:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
15/11/23, 6:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
15/11/23, 6:29 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Yes indeed it was explained
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
15/11/23, 8:53 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Yes we are. It is clearly understood
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
15/11/23, 8:57 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Yes I have. This will be the remaining amount the student has to pay after?
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right! Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000 = $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $400 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Understood
15/11/23, 9:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 9:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
15/11/23, 9:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
15/11/23, 9:47 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Understood
15/11/23, 10:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
15/11/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: As the hour grows late on my end, I'm afraid I have limited time available today. Therefore, I regretfully must conclude our conversation for now.

Let's plan to reconnect tomorrow starting from 1:00 PM onwards to continue our discussion. Wishing you a peaceful and pleasant evening. Please convey my warm regards to your esteemed family as well.
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Valentine and Esteemed Family,
I hope this message finds you well today. 

I trust that the intervening period has been productive and filled with positivity on your end.

As we resume our conversation from yesterday, I am eager to guide you through the next steps in your admission journey. Before we proceed, if I may ask are you ready for today's session?
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Good afternoon. Our session yesterday was so insightful however as a parent I also feel Valentine should be involved in such discussions, and I believe he mentioned that he will only be available next week since this week he won't be able to participate fully. <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 1:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please and I completely understand Valentine's availability constraints for this week and appreciate your presence in our ongoing discussions. 

However, in the due time that we wait for Valentine to connect with us here, we can continue with the discussion and once he will return, he can catch up with the conversation. I hope this is understood?
16/11/23, 1:54 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Yes it's understood
16/11/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, if I may ask are you clear till here so that we can proceed?
16/11/23, 2:10 pm - +27 83 499 2115: It is clear
16/11/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/11/23, 2:45 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Not really. I clearly understand the admission process
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 3:17 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Thank you for the information. And definitely we are excited to get the offer letter
16/11/23, 7:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
16/11/23, 7:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
16/11/23, 8:29 pm - +27 83 499 2115: It is well understood
16/11/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, with great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
16/11/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
16/11/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
16/11/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
16/11/23, 9:25 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Thank you I have reviewed the benefits.
16/11/23, 10:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
16/11/23, 10:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
16/11/23, 10:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
16/11/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: As the time draws closer to evening on my end, I regret to inform you that I have limited availability remaining for today. Hence, I must conclude our conversation for now.

Let's aim to reconnect tomorrow, starting from 1:00 PM onwards, to continue our discussion. I hope this arrangement suits your schedule. Wishing you a peaceful and pleasant evening ahead. Please convey my warm regards to your esteemed family as well.
17/11/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Esteemed Family and Valentine! 

I hope this message finds you well today. As per our previous conversation, I am reaching out to continue our discussion regarding your university admission journey. I trust that you've had a productive day so far. 

Moving ahead, shall we begin with our scheduled session now?
17/11/23, 1:42 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Good afternoon. We may proceed
17/11/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. How has your day been going so far?
17/11/23, 2:18 pm - +27 83 499 2115: My day has been fine, thank you for asking, hope your your day has been fine as well
17/11/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: My day has been going well too. Moving ahead, if I may ask, are you clear till here so that we can proceed?
17/11/23, 2:56 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Yes I understood
17/11/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Let us now move towards the second point please.
17/11/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/11/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/11/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/11/23, 5:22 pm - +27 83 499 2115: So basically your fees structure remains the same from one year to the next despite an increase at the university?
17/11/23, 7:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. This is when you choose to complete the admission process now and to avail the Endowment Benefits. I hope this is clear?
17/11/23, 7:51 pm - +27 83 499 2115: It is clear
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/11/23, 8:59 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Understood
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/11/23, 11:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: As the night is overdue on my end, I regret to inform you that my availability is becoming limited for today. Therefore, I must bring our conversation to a close for now.

Let's plan to reconnect tomorrow, starting from 08:30 AM onwards, to continue our discussion. Wishing you a peaceful and pleasant night ahead. Please extend my warm regards to your esteemed family as well.
18/11/23, 8:04 am - +27 83 499 2115: It is clear
18/11/23, 8:57 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Esteemed Family and Valentine!

I hope this message finds you well rested and ready for another productive day ahead. I am looking forward to continuing our discussion from where we left off yesterday regarding your university admission journey.

Shall we proceed with our scheduled session now?
18/11/23, 10:17 am - +27 83 499 2115: Good morning. Yes we may
18/11/23, 10:28 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, can you please let me know if you are clear till here please?
18/11/23, 10:30 am - +27 83 499 2115: Yes it is
18/11/23, 10:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, if I may ask, it this point clear to you as well?
18/11/23, 11:13 am - +27 83 499 2115: I understand that you can pay in batches.
18/11/23, 12:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/11/23, 12:46 pm - +27 83 499 2115: You can pay more information
18/11/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/11/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/11/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/11/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/11/23, 2:15 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Thank you for the clarity
20/11/23, 8:26 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Valentine!
I hope this message finds you well.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I regret to inform you that I need to reschedule our ongoing discussion regarding your admission process. An urgent matter has arisen that requires my immediate attention.

Due to that, I propose rescheduling our conversation to a new time slot. Could we reconvene today at 01.00 PM CAT in order to move ahead with our conversation? May you, please let me know if this new time suits you, or if you would prefer an alternative time that fits your schedule better.
20/11/23, 1:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Valentine!

I am glad to reconnect with you here. Now, as we're about to reconvene our discussion shortly, I trust you're ready to continue with our conversation as per the schedule?
20/11/23, 1:24 pm - +27 71 622 8502: Good afternoon Mr Milan , I'm happy to be back in our discussions , I hope everyone is doing well
20/11/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please everything is going as good as it can get. How was your weekend?
20/11/23, 1:32 pm - +27 71 622 8502: It was busy but could be well managed , I hope yours was amazing
20/11/23, 2:48 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Good afternoon
20/11/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please mine was amazing! Moving ahead in our conversation, may I know if you are clear till here please?
20/11/23, 3:33 pm - +27 71 622 8502: Yes please
20/11/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/11/23, 4:01 pm - +27 71 622 8502: No queries yet sir
20/11/23, 4:14 pm - +27 83 499 2115: It is clear
21/11/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents Valentine!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Mr. Shivjeet, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

21/11/23, 3:53 pm - +27 71 622 8502: Thank you so much . It was amazing communicating with you ,have great days Mr Milan.
21/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Valentine!

I hope you're having a fine evening today. I am Mr. Shivjeet, your admission officer starting today. I would like to inform you that I will be taking over your session for the admission process, as Mr. Milan has been assigned to a new role as informed to you. I am pleased to let you know that he will be there upon your arrival in India to guide you through the university and you will be meeting him in person.

With that said, I will be reaching out to you tomorrow to further proceed with the session. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to let me know. I am always happy to guide you through them. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/11/23, 8:08 pm - +27 71 622 8502: It is nice to be meeting you Mr Shivjeet. Thank you for the great news
22/11/23, 11:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Valentine!

I hope you are having a wonderful time. I would like to let you know that I will be available for this evening at 6:00 PM CAT. So please stay tuned and relax for now, and let us connect at the said time frame. Please enjoy your afternoon!
22/11/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
22/11/23, 7:24 pm - +27 71 622 8502: Good evening sir .I apologize for being late due to the unforeseen apparent load shedding in our area. But I am ready to proceed
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alreight. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
22/11/23, 7:31 pm - +27 71 622 8502: I agree
22/11/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
22/11/23, 7:42 pm - +27 71 622 8502: Yes Sir
22/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
22/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
22/11/23, 7:49 pm - +27 71 622 8502: This is very clear
22/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
22/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
22/11/23, 7:59 pm - +27 71 622 8502: Very clear
22/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
22/11/23, 8:03 pm - +27 71 622 8502: And from this point , one will not be able to have the same opportunity even if one wishes to go back to academics in future?
22/11/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly here is the solution for that
22/11/23, 8:07 pm - +27 71 622 8502: Very much understood
22/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/11/23, 8:22 pm - +27 83 499 2115: As of now all is clear.
22/11/23, 8:23 pm - +27 71 622 8502: May I please ask;
In future , due to unfortunate circumstances, should one not be able to meet the required costs or the financial strains on an individual would be bad in the time during one's studies, what would be the consequences ?
22/11/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 5:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 9:17 pm - +27 71 622 8502: Thank you , have a blessed night
23/11/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 7:00 pm - +27 83 499 2115: Good evening sir. Yes we may proceed.
23/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
23/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early.
23/11/23, 8:00 pm - +27 71 622 8502: Thank you for the clarity
What about the same circumstances along the line during one's studies ? ( after admission , I fail to think my parents will be able to sustain the finances required from the student - for a long period - hence I would like to know what the consequences would be with failure to meet future expenses. I understand that EWYL will greatly help with student's financial burdens but I also understand there would be some amounts required from my side of which my parents might not be able to keep up with for a long time)

May I please kindly ask for an update on our admission discussion schedule. Since my exams are almost coming to an end I will definitely have more time for our important discussions.

28/11/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon parent and my dear student!

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
28/11/23, 4:55 pm - +27 71 622 8502: We are doing very good. How are you?
29/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
