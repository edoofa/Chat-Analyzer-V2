For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
17/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Thank you
17/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Yes
17/11/23, 7:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 671 4402: I am done
17/11/23, 8:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
17/11/23, 8:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
17/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Very clear...Thank you
17/11/23, 8:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
17/11/23, 8:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
17/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Yes sir
17/11/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
17/11/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
17/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Yes thank you
17/11/23, 8:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
17/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 671 4402: I dont have any questions thank you
17/11/23, 9:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*? <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Yes
17/11/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
17/11/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
17/11/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Yes

17/11/23, 10:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

21/11/23, 9:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents and Sharon!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:07 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Mr. Shivjeet, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
21/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 73 536 1434: Noted.thank you

I am always happy to guide you through them. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

22/11/23, 11:51 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Sharon!

I hope you are having a wonderful time. I would like to let you know that I will be available for this evening at 6:00 PM CAT. So please stay tuned and relax for now, and let us connect at the said time frame. Please enjoy your afternoon!
22/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 671 4402: Good Afternoon,  Noted
22/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to heart that. May I know if you were able to fill out the online SOP form.
22/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 671 4402: What is the SOP form?
22/11/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This was the SOP form meaning Statement of purpose
22/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 671 4402: I submitted
22/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Diploma in Medical Lab. Technology and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
22/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Yes  sir
22/11/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
22/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Yes
22/11/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
\
22/11/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
22/11/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
22/11/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Yes
22/11/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/11/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/11/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Yes
22/11/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 5:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Same to you.
23/11/23, 6:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 73 536 1434: Good Evening , yes
23/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
23/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Yes
23/11/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
23/11/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: $2000 - $3000 Range:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
23/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
23/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 73 536 1434: Yes
23/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
23/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
23/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Noted thank you
25/11/23, 11:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning parents and my dear student!

I hope you're enjoying a pleasant weekend. Apologies for not being able to connect with you yesterday as I was tied up with some unforeseen work. I've set aside this weekend for our discussion and I am now available and eager to proceed with our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can continue.
25/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Good Afternoon,  sorry I've been having network problems , You may proceed
27/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I was not able to connect with you as it was past my available hours. Please, how are you doing today?
27/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Good Afternoon,  Im fine thanks and you?
27/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
27/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Yes
27/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 671 4402: Noted
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/11/23, 8:02 pm - +353 89 224 4932: Good evening to you all, I wanted clarity on the time and commencement of the programme after the final admission process
27/11/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It will be commenced on the month of August 2024.
27/11/23, 8:11 pm - +353 89 224 4932: Noted thank you

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
