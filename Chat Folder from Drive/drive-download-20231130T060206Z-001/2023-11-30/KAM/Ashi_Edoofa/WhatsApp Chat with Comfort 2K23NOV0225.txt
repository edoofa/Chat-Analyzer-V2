09/11/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
09/11/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
09/11/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
09/11/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
09/11/23, 7:05 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: So as a student i will be required to write a statement of purpose?
09/11/23, 7:05 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Is it written as in a form of an essay? Letter? Or??
09/11/23, 7:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @265996024472, Please don't worry we will share the form with you soon.

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
09/11/23, 7:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
09/11/23, 7:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
09/11/23, 7:09 pm - +265 999 86 06 62: What are the actual documents required at this stage?
09/11/23, 7:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265999860662, We will need Comfort's National Id, A level and O level document.

09/11/23, 7:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
09/11/23, 7:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
09/11/23, 7:13 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes they're clear
09/11/23, 7:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. Let's start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*
09/11/23, 7:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
09/11/23, 7:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
09/11/23, 7:16 pm - +265 999 86 06 62: In Malawi is Malawi School Certificate of Education (MSCE).  However, for her National ID, it is still being processed with the National Registration Bureau. What we have right now is the ID number only, waiting for the card to be printed
09/11/23, 7:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, In that case, you need to share MSCE, and JCE document. As Comfort national Id is still in process, in that case you can share the registration form or Comfort's Birth Certificate.
09/11/23, 7:25 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: You can share
09/11/23, 7:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, I am sharing the videos with you, I am sure you must be excited for the videos.
09/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 7:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 7:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 7:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 7:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Comfort, I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
09/11/23, 7:34 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: We can start the next session probably after 45 minutes so that i can go through them properly and since network is a problem here...So are you okay with that?
09/11/23, 7:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @265996024472Let's connect at 8:30pm in that case.
09/11/23, 7:39 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright
09/11/23, 7:42 pm - +265 999 86 06 62: Comfort do not have JCE because malawi government once aborted that qualification the time she was at level.
09/11/23, 7:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know, in that case you need to request a letter from your school stating that the JCE was removed along with the subjects that you initially took to appear for the exam. I hope you understand.
09/11/23, 11:33 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Hello..i have gone through the videos from the founders and i understand that a student must be open minded and it is very important to follow instructions given.
I understand that a student develops a spirit of independence through the EWYL programme by doing projects and the feeling of independency is nice to a student especially when receiving scholarship credits as their achievements.
A student is able to rely on oneself and gains employability skills along with confidence giving a good impression to companies who easily employ them(Edoofians)because of their expression..
The founders also act as parents to Edoofians..As good parents,they took about ten years of exploring different schools and universities so that Edoofians can be enrolled in good schools..The founders help students to get enrolled in schools that have good learning structures,nice facilities and dedicated staff that focuses on employability..not only that but also schools where friendships are built through interaction and culture for example they mentioned the colour festival.
I have also learnt about the Edoofa triangle which talks about attitude,skills and knowledge that have become the bedrock of Edoofa programme..
The founders are very happy to help Edoofians with higher education yet affordable for all.
Another important stage is on the statement of purpose (SOP) that helps students to convince different schools why they are worthy of being enrolled  in their schools. The SOP involves a student citing his\her strengths,past achievements,vision and academic progress.
In conclusion personally,i am impressed by the Edoofa scholarship programme and the politeness and support all way long.
Thank you
14/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Comfort, I hope you are doing well. 

Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you the past couple of days, we were celebrating a major Indian festival - "Festival of Lights" which is also known as Diwali. 

It is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
14/11/23, 2:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The significance of Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year. I am sure once you are in India, you will be able to celebrate this happy festival with us and experience all of these emotions.

On this note, I am excited to commence today's session. Kindly let me know if you are ready to proceed, and I look forward to our meaningful time together.

14/11/23, 5:16 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: I am here
14/11/23, 5:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Comfort, How have you been?

I wanted to follow up regarding the videos that were shared with you. Were you able to review all four of them? I am keen to discuss them further and would greatly appreciate your feedback.
14/11/23, 5:20 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: I have been fine
14/11/23, 5:20 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes i did answer the same day regarding the videos
14/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
14/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
14/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
14/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
14/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
14/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
14/11/23, 5:24 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes i understood the videos very well
14/11/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
14/11/23, 5:28 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes we are.
14/11/23, 5:31 pm - +265 999 86 06 62: Sure
14/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
14/11/23, 5:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

16/11/23, 7:49 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:49 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Question number 1👆
16/11/23, 7:50 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: 2. Explain about BPM(Business process managent)life cycle?
  
The Business Process management life cycle is a series of steps that organizations follow to manage and improve other business processes.It consists of six phases which are shown below;
      *1.Design*
This is where one identifies current processes and design new processes baaed on their goals and objectives.

In this phase,one creates visual models/diagrams to represent your processes.This helps you understand how different activities and components fit together.
    *3.Execution*
In this phase,one implements and automate processes using BPM software or other tools.BPM software can include Pega and Affian.
    *4.Monitoring*

16/11/23, 7:50 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: 3.How does business contribute to economic development?..Elaborate with an example..

businesses plays a crucial role economic development.
It creates jobs,generates income and drives innovation.Lets say there is a small town called Kaka land.A local entrepreneur starts a bakery business,hiring employees and producing delicious baked goods.As the bakery grows,it not only provides employment opportunities but also attracts customers from neighbouring towns.This increased economic activity leads to more spending,job creation and overall development in the area.So,businesses like the bakery contribute to the economic growth of a community.

When businesses thrive,they create job opportunities for people in the community.These jobs provide income for individuals which in turn stimulates spending and boosts the local economy.

Employees spend their earnings or income on goods and services in the area such as groceries,housing and entertainment.This increased spending benefits local businesses who may hire employees to meet the growing demand.

Thus the growth and success of businesses contribute to economic development by creating jobs,stimulating spending and driving innovation.Its a cycle that's fuels progress and prosperity in a community.
16/11/23, 7:50 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: 4.Explain with an example from your life which shows your managerial talent/skills.

Let me share an example from my life which shows my managerial talent/skill.

There was this other time during holidays back in high school,when i visited my aunt who owns a restaurant in her city.Since she is a busy lady,she put me in charge of her restaurant.I was responsible for overseeing the daily operations,ensuring smooth service and maintaining customer satisfaction.
One day,
There was a sudden surge in customers and the kitchen staff was struggling to keep up with the orders. I quickly assessed the situation,identified the bottleneck in the kitchen and took action..
I reorganized the workflow,assigned additional staff to high demand areas and communicated effectively with the team to ensure everyone was on the same page.

My managerial skills shine through as I remained calm under pressure,made quick decisions and effectively delegated tasks.

My ability to solve problems,lead the team wisely and adapt to changing circumstances ensured that the restaurant continued to provide excellent service even during busy times.I came up with new innovations and ideas.
16/11/23, 7:50 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: 5. Explain the importance of human resources in an organisation?

16/11/23, 7:55 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:56 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:58 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:59 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: National ID number is 15EXBVNM
16/11/23, 8:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (17-Nov-2023).
16/11/23, 8:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/BeVL6iBcPW2A0he9Uscifl
16/11/23, 8:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Comfort Francisca Chitedze, and my EWYL group name is Comfort EWYL23E0897. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (17-Nov-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
16/11/23, 8:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
16/11/23, 8:12 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: This is well noted
16/11/23, 8:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BBA* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
16/11/23, 8:16 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes that is very correct
16/11/23, 8:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
16/11/23, 8:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
16/11/23, 8:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
16/11/23, 8:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/11/23, 8:24 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes that's right
16/11/23, 8:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
16/11/23, 8:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
16/11/23, 8:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
16/11/23, 8:31 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes correct
16/11/23, 8:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
16/11/23, 8:35 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yeah sure
16/11/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
16/11/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?* <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 8:46 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Noted
16/11/23, 8:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
16/11/23, 8:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
16/11/23, 8:56 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright Ma'am
16/11/23, 8:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
16/11/23, 8:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
16/11/23, 9:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
16/11/23, 9:05 pm - +265 999 86 06 62: Here you mean paying US$1000 within 2 weeks?
16/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me provide some clarity on this matter. You don't have to worry about paying the registration fee right now. Let me help you in understanding the process -  you'll receive multiple offers from different universities. Once you've made your final decision on which university to pusue your Higher Education, that's when we will proceed with your admission application, at that time you need to complete the registration payment. 

Please rest assured that we are here to support you every step of the way, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free admission journey. If you have any more questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. Your academic success is our top priority.
16/11/23, 9:12 pm - +265 999 86 06 62: Oh okay because $1000 is almost 2 million Malawi Kwacha correctly with bank charges and almost 4 months salary for me.
16/11/23, 9:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We understand the same @265999860662, I would like to encourage you to start preparing for the finances now <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 9:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/11/23, 9:18 pm - +265 999 86 06 62: Will continue engaging you. Thanks
16/11/23, 9:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
16/11/23, 9:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
16/11/23, 9:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
16/11/23, 9:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 9:25 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: That is clear as well
16/11/23, 9:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
16/11/23, 9:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
16/11/23, 9:43 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Thank you
16/11/23, 9:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Most Welcome @265996024472. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
16/11/23, 9:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
16/11/23, 9:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
16/11/23, 9:56 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: We can proceed
16/11/23, 9:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
16/11/23, 9:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
16/11/23, 10:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
16/11/23, 10:08 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Does this mean we will be paying a less amount for admission or what exactly?
Assist me in understanding that part.
16/11/23, 10:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265996024472 With this benefit you will be able to reserve your scholarship seat before the admission opens for regular students.
16/11/23, 10:10 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Oh alright
16/11/23, 10:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
16/11/23, 10:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
16/11/23, 10:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?

\
16/11/23, 10:16 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes Ma'am
16/11/23, 10:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
16/11/23, 10:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/11/23, 10:34 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes i understand
16/11/23, 10:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
16/11/23, 10:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
16/11/23, 10:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
16/11/23, 10:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265996024472 May I know if you have taken a note of the above messages?
16/11/23, 10:48 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes I have
16/11/23, 10:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: So  are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
16/11/23, 10:51 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Im so excited to be among the students to benefit from the programme ma'am
16/11/23, 10:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
16/11/23, 10:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
16/11/23, 10:55 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Thank you so much for the opportunity...
Ill get back to you if there are any questions or if i need clarification.
17/11/23, 9:43 am - +265 996 02 44 72: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is ____Ananya_____ and  she has scheduled my session for __17/11/23 1:30pm______*(mention the date)
25/11/23, 1:45 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Good Afternoon Ma'am

25/11/23, 1:52 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: You are welcome
27/11/23, 10:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Comfort,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Quest Group of Institutions* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
27/11/23, 10:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 02:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
27/11/23, 10:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 02:00 PM to 08:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

27/11/23, 10:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 10:43 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Is this the only offer letter im getting?..Or we have to wait?
27/11/23, 10:45 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Does this mean i am getting 60% at every university?
27/11/23, 10:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, For now, we have received the offer letter from *Quest Group of Institutions* and we will discuss the offer letter tomorrow. You may receive more offer letter in the future.
27/11/23, 10:49 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: So the letter is asking us to pay $500 for what?
27/11/23, 10:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265996024472 Tomorrow we will discuss more about the offer letter in detail. Let us plan to reconnect in the afternoon at 02:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion. 

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete *Quest Group of Institutions*  admission formalities.

For now, we will bring our conversation to a close. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
27/11/23, 10:53 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Can we connect tomorrow at 5pm?
27/11/23, 10:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, Let's schedule our session for 5pm.
27/11/23, 10:54 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright.
28/11/23, 4:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Comfort,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 4:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 5:11 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Good afternoon ma'am
28/11/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @265996024472, Are you ready for the discussion?
28/11/23, 5:12 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes i am ready.
28/11/23, 5:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @265996024472. I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 5:18 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Tuition fee per annum after the scholarship is $1000
28/11/23, 5:18 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Accommodation fee varies on the type of room you would want to accommodate
28/11/23, 5:19 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Registration fee is $500
28/11/23, 5:23 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Not so??
28/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response @265996024472. As you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1000.
						–
Along with this, there is a $100 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your uniform fee, library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $100 to the per annum tuition fee of $1000, the total comes out to be $1100.
28/11/23, 5:26 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright
28/11/23, 5:26 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Go ahead
28/11/23, 5:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
						
However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus. <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 5:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $500 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1100  + $500 = $1600. I hope you are clear about this?
28/11/23, 5:29 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes i am clear
28/11/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/11/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/11/23, 5:32 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes continue
28/11/23, 5:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1600 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/11/23, 5:41 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Yes i understand
28/11/23, 5:45 pm - +265 999 86 06 62: Afternoon Ashi, I have seen the offer letter, however, with reference to previous sessions it seems the scholarship has taken another twist. As we were told that Comfort 's scholarship was covering accommodation, library, food, laundry, wi-fi etc. But as it is now it seems most of these expenses are to born by the student. Can you explain
28/11/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @265999860662, I hope you are doing well. 

Let me help you understand that please, you are absolute right that the scholarship covers all the expenses for Comfort. With this, I would like to share that there is no twist in the scholarship as we shared that the total cost of education for Comfort is $1600 which includes all the expenses like accommodation, library, food and other facilities. On the same note, I would like to highlight that $1600 falls within the range that was shared with you early on which was $1200 - $1800.
28/11/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you understand?
28/11/23, 5:56 pm - +265 999 86 06 62: And also in the letter there is a condition of paying $500 within 15 days, of which according to our economy, inflation, devaluation of our currency this month by 44%, as well as my earnings I cannot afford. This was discussed too during interviews and I openly said that my income can't afford one off payment, unless it is spread within months because my income only comes from salary.
28/11/23, 5:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @265999860662, For this concern, we will discuss about the same in detail shortly.
28/11/23, 6:00 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: But i remember it was said that i will receive multiple offer letters so that i can choose one from that....When im i getting the other offer letters?
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265996024472 Yes dear, you may receive more offer letters as your application is in process with other universities. As of now, we have received the response from *Quest Group of Institutions*
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Im still not getting it.
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: So what if the other offer letters come after the 15 days??
28/11/23, 6:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, I'll clear all your doubts at the end of session so that we can first share all the details about the offer letter. Please don't worry about your query as I have taken a note of them. Is it okay?
28/11/23, 6:05 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Alright
28/11/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the understanding Comfory, Moving ahead, as informed, the registration fee of $500 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year's tuition fee, therefore the amount of tuition fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1100 - $500 = $600. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
28/11/23, 6:09 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: That's clear
28/11/23, 6:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $500 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.  Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 11th, 2023*.
28/11/23, 6:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
28/11/23, 6:14 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: Explain.
28/11/23, 6:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $350 of the registration fee. This $350 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$175 before the first deadline date of December 11th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$175 before the second deadline date of January 11th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
28/11/23, 6:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $350 within 15 working days, before *December 11th, 2023*.

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
28/11/23, 6:34 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: So this means we should pay $175 before 15 days are over and later pay $175 after 30 days?
28/11/23, 6:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @265996024472 you are correct. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/11/23, 6:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/11/23, 6:38 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: We are From Malawi,,not Zimbabwe
28/11/23, 6:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for that @265996024472. Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.

28/11/23, 6:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265999860662 I hope you can understand that these deadlines are shared by the university, hence postponing the deadline would be challenging.
28/11/23, 6:57 pm - +265 999 86 06 62: But it's a request to them as well. Since these other children have to be enrolled too
28/11/23, 6:57 pm - +265 996 02 44 72: But here you said that i have received the offer letter in advance what did you mean?

29/11/23, 2:39 pm - +265 999 86 06 62: Afternoon,  as we prepare today's session.  I would like to know the following 
- when is the school commencing for 1st year students in 2024?
- which province/town/district is the university situated?
- I saw something like exam fees, does this mean the school does not administer it's own exams? If the school does it's own exams, why having a separate fee for the same? For example in our country Malawi there are private colleges/technical colleges which just teach but the examinations, they book with foreign exam bodies like ABE, ABMA, CIPS, City & Guilds etc, while as for the public & Universities administer their own exams because it is approved/accredited by government
29/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Comfort, I hope you are doing well.
