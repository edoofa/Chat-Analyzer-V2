For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
13/09/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Yes
13/09/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Yea i understand the admission process
13/09/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
13/09/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
13/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Yes lets proceed
13/09/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
13/09/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
13/09/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Yes im following
13/09/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
13/09/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
13/09/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Clear
13/09/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Yes we can proceed
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
13/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Ok im ready
13/09/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
13/09/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

13/09/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
13/09/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
13/09/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
13/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Well becouse of poor network connection it will take a while
13/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, can I anticipate that you will able to go through the videos by tomorrow 08.00 pm?
13/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Yes i will be done
13/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great night.
13/09/23, 9:26 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Thank you Sir same to you
14/09/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 128 5721: from video 1 i understood that Edoofa students should be able to learn new things and understand them as well as thinking in other terms or outside the ordinary
14/09/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 128 5721: From video 2 i understood that Edoofa is trying its best to make students reach their full potential in terms of success and being independent as an individual not just assisting in the payment of tuition as scholarships.
14/09/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 128 5721: From video 3 i learnt that Edoofa not only help students get through School but assists them in qualifying for the best institutions for their learning to be a success.
14/09/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 128 5721: From the forth video i learnt that students are to adhere to a statement of purpose and follow the instructions included therein and also to rake note of every other instruction given by Edoofa.
14/09/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tendaishe.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
14/09/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
14/09/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

15/09/23, 5:35 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Business process management (BPM) is a structured approach to improving the processes organizations use to get work done, serve their customers and generate business value. A business process is an activity or set of activities that helps accomplish an organization's goals, such as increasing profits or promoting workforce diversity. BPM uses various methods to improve a business process by analyzing it, modeling how it works in different scenarios, implementing changes, monitoring the new process and continuously improving its ability to drive desired business outcomes and results.

BPM is a broad discipline and, by definition, a dynamic one given how the organizational roles, rules, tactics, business goals and other elements it encompasses are constantly changing. Over the years, BPM has accommodated a variety of optimization methodologies. 

As business processes at some companies became too large and complex to be managed without the aid of automated tools, BPM software products were developed to support large-scale business change. These enabling BPM technologies have in turn evolved, driven by advances in AI, machine learning and other so-called intelligent technologies that are providing new ways to discover, design, measure, improve and automate workflows. With the rise of digital business, BPM's traditional focus on back-end processes has shifted to now include the optimization of customer and employee systems of engagement.

As a discipline, business process management can also be confusing. Its practice varies widely among organizations depending on their size, process maturity, technical sophistication, corporate culture and resources. It can be narrow or large in scope: BPM's principles and techniques can be applied to the management of a single process, such as bringing on a new customer, or to a major business transformation requiring the implementation of radically new processes. The success of a BPM initiative depends to a great degree on an organization's capacity to see value in process improvement.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Yes im available how are you sir
20/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 128 5721: I saw the message late becouse of network cuts
20/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great that is alright, I understand that network can be a challenge. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
20/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
20/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
20/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 128 5721: of course sir i want pursue a Bachelor of Business Administration
20/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 128 5721: That's correct
20/09/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
20/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Im ready
20/09/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
20/09/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/09/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/09/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Yes please a student can only study at one university you are right
20/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 128 5721: So we are on the third stage right
20/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you are absolutely correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Correct
20/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Yes we are together
20/09/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings kindly excuse me for the delay, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/09/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Yes i am
20/09/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now may I know if you are clear here?
20/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 128 5721: clear
20/09/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
20/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Understandable
20/09/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
20/09/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
20/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Noted thank you
20/09/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 128 5721: ✅
20/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
20/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 128 5721: No queries
20/09/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/09/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
20/09/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Thank you will be glad to recieve the offer letter
20/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
20/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
20/09/23, 10:24 pm - +263 78 128 5721: yes we can proceed
20/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point? <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Clear
20/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 78 128 5721: I understand
20/09/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/09/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 78 128 5721: It is clear
20/09/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/09/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/09/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 5, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 5, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 5, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/09/23, 10:37 pm - +263 78 128 5721: We are together
20/09/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
20/09/23, 10:40 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Yes we can proceed with the process
20/09/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
20/09/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
20/09/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
20/09/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
20/09/23, 10:45 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Clear
20/09/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
20/09/23, 10:47 pm - +263 78 128 5721: You are right
20/09/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
20/09/23, 10:51 pm - +263 78 128 5721: I agree
20/09/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
20/09/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
20/09/23, 10:54 pm - +263 78 128 5721: clear
20/09/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
20/09/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
20/09/23, 10:55 pm - +263 78 128 5721: It's clear
20/09/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
20/09/23, 10:57 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Understandable
20/09/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 10:58 pm - +263 78 128 5721: No queries
20/09/23, 10:59 pm - +263 78 128 5721: So if im done with my education am i be able to find a job in India
20/09/23, 11:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed Tendaishe, we have specifically designed the EWYL program for that so that you will be able to learn the 21st-century skills that every student is required to have to be employable ready plus with our partnered Universities we make sure that every Edoofian gets a chance for practical experience through internships and placement which will take place in your last year of the course.  

I hope we are clear now?
20/09/23, 11:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now as Tendaishe's guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Tendaishe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/09/23, 11:09 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Im very excited Sir
20/09/23, 11:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned. <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 11:11 pm - +263 78 128 5721: So now we are waiting for the offer right?

26/09/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendaishe!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University.

26/09/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Thank you, excuse me when am I required to pay the $750 registration fee
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendaishe!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
27/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Yes thank yu
27/09/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
27/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Would want to know when to pay the 750$
27/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 128 5721: 1. $1800
27/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 128 5721: 2.  3 years
27/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 128 5721: 3.  $300 usd
27/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 128 5721: 4. $750 usd
27/09/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, @263781285721 On point number one, I believe you have misunderstood the same. Hence, can you pleas take a look at the letter again and then let me know of the same.
27/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Oooh it's $900
27/09/23, 4:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
27/09/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Yes am clear
28/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
28/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
28/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: From the discussion that we were having here earlier regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University. May I know if you are clear till here please so that we can move ahead with our conversation and proceed to the next steps in your admission journey?
30/09/23, 10:32 am - +263 78 128 5721: Yes we are clear
30/09/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
30/09/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 128 5721: Yes lets proceed
30/09/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
30/09/23, 11:01 am - +263 78 128 5721: Understandable
30/09/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
30/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 128 5721: Clear
30/09/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
30/09/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
30/09/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
30/09/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 128 5721: Yes im clear
30/09/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
30/09/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
30/09/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 128 5721: Yes im in Harare Dzivarasekwa Extension
30/09/23, 11:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
30/09/23, 11:07 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
30/09/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
30/09/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 128 5721: Ok thank you sir
30/09/23, 11:17 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
30/09/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 128 5721: Yes you can share
30/09/23, 11:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
30/09/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 128 5721: Thank you
30/09/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
30/09/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 128 5721: Ok i understand
30/09/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 128 5721: So its gonna be affordable with scholar
30/09/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Yes
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
04/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 128 5721: understandable
04/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Sorry sir i need help on the issue of the University, is there any other university i can go not Golgotious please can you help me to find another one especially  LPU
05/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 128 5721: And others include Sharda University, Charndigah ,CT University, Indian University of technology..
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with me here. Now, let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
06/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Si may you please help me the issue of selection of universities i want to know if you can help me to change the type of university that i was given i was given Golgotious yet im willing to study at LPU  or Sharda or Charndigah or CT and Indian University i kindly request for assistance Sir if you can kindly search a place for me to the Universities i listed above please help 🙏

07/10/23, 10:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Now, as of now, your application has been only accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
07/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 632 7102: We are very clear thank you

I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 3:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Were you able to take your time to go through the offer letters that I had shared here in detail and are you available to discuss that in detail?
17/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Thank you sir we are still processing to make a good decision on which one to take
17/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 128 5721: Yeah i have decided to study at LPU thank you for helping me to get the offer letter Sir
18/10/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. On that note, shall we move ahead to discuss the offer letter from LPU please?
18/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Yes thank you
18/10/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
19/10/23, 6:49 am - +263 78 128 5721: 1. $1950
19/10/23, 6:49 am - +263 78 128 5721: 2. 3 years
19/10/23, 6:49 am - +263 78 128 5721: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 6:51 am - +263 78 128 5721: 3. $200
19/10/23, 6:52 am - +263 78 128 5721: 4.$700
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 9:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Tendaishe, on point number one, I have asked about your tuition fee at LPU after the scholarship, therefore, may you please take a look at the letter again and then let me know of the same dear.
19/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 128 5721: ok Its $975
19/10/23, 9:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
19/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Yes it is very clear thank you
19/10/23, 9:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
19/10/23, 9:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
19/10/23, 9:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
19/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Noted thank you
19/10/23, 11:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
19/10/23, 11:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 5:02 am - +263 77 632 7102: Very clear thank you
20/10/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here now dear?
20/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 128 5721: yes we can
20/10/23, 5:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you are clear till here please?
20/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Very clear thank you
20/10/23, 5:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
20/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Very clear thank you
20/10/23, 5:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $700 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days. <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 5:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$275 before 31st October 2023.*
2. *$275 before 30th November 2023.* <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 5:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $550 within 15 working days by *31st October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Excuse  me can you allow me to extend  days will i pay $275 before 10 October and the other $275 before 10 November?
20/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Sorry the other one before 10 December
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please let me know why is it that you wish to get an extension for the same?
20/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Financial  problems thats wen i get bonuses
20/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 632 7102: When
20/10/23, 8:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. However, here we are not the ones giving you the deadlines please. The deadlines are provided from the side of the university itself, therefore, we do have no interference in that
20/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Ok
20/10/23, 8:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, moving ahead, we would have to stick by these deadlines please. I hope you understand please?
20/10/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 632 7102: I understand
20/10/23, 8:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 8:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Yes
20/10/23, 9:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 9:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 9:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Noted thank you
20/10/23, 9:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Yes share,would prefer Mr Rajan for 7%
20/10/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
20/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 632 7102: With Mr Charles  the charges are highèr
20/10/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your edsucation more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/10/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Very clear thank you
20/10/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 632 7102: Yes
20/10/23, 10:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 78 128 5721: No Sir
20/10/23, 10:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

20/10/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for the same please. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
20/10/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 10:05 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
