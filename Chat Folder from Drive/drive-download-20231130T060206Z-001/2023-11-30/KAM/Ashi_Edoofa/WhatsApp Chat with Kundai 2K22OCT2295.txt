25/09/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely afternoon?
25/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 73 773 4295: We are doing good sir how are you
25/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 73 773 4295: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 73 773 4295: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 3:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Yes l am ready sir
25/09/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
25/09/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Yes sir l still remember it
25/09/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me? <This message was edited>
25/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 73 773 4295: I have understood sir, about the first 3 steps
25/09/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/09/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
25/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Yes sir we are excited
25/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Wow this is so exciting , yes we are on the same page sir
25/09/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/09/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

25/09/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
25/09/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Powerful my God. We are happy to hear that as a family too.
25/09/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/09/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
25/09/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
25/09/23, 4:44 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Yes lam sir
25/09/23, 4:44 pm - +263 73 773 4295: We can proceed
25/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 73 773 4295: I agree with these benefits with  an assurance that l will pass with higher scores
25/09/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/09/23, 4:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
25/09/23, 5:00 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Understood sir
25/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/09/23, 5:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/09/23, 5:35 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Understood sir
25/09/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/09/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/09/23, 5:57 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Yes sir
25/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/09/23, 6:19 pm - +263 73 773 4295: No yet so far
25/09/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/09/23, 6:26 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Provide with more information sir
25/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
25/09/23, 6:38 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Thank you sir , for today's session
26/09/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Kundai !

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Afternoon sir.q
26/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Let's proceed
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Understood and clear
26/09/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Yes sir
26/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 73 773 4295: 1
26/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Clear
26/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/09/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/09/23, 4:14 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Yes l am clear with it sir, so will l have an opportunity of getting a job after acquiring my diploma in india
26/09/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/09/23, 4:16 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Clear sir
26/09/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 73 773 4295: I don't have any
26/09/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Kundai's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Kundai is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
26/09/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Yes please
26/09/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Kundai's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/09/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Thank you sir
26/09/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
26/09/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 329 9280: We shall confirm if necessary
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Kundai!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
28/09/23, 5:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 6:33 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Good day sir , we are all doing well, how are you,  l am happy to hear about the news
28/09/23, 6:34 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Thank you sir
28/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Congratulations everybody on this notification. We have waiting to hear results of our efforts. Congratulations once more
28/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Been
29/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
29/09/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 329 9280: We are doing good sir. Let's proceed
29/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
29/09/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 329 9280: $900 after scholarship, 3 years duration,  $300 admission and procedure and registration $750 all in USD
29/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
29/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Yes clear
29/09/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
29/09/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
29/09/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
29/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 329 9280: As international students we have no idea of living standards of other countries so we entirely depend on on campus accommodation for security reasons
29/09/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I completely understand your concern about living standards in a new country. It's common for international students to initially opt for on-campus accommodation for several reasons, including security and the convenience of being close to academic facilities.

However, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes, therefore no need for transport, hence eliminating the transport costs.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this clears the doubt that you have here, right?
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Clear sir
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
29/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Yes sir , we are together
29/09/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
29/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Well understood sir. Then l am convinced to safely  go for off campus accommodation with cooking facilities
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 73 773 4295: Clear
29/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Clear sir
29/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 73 773 4295: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding this statement, it means that you would have to submit your A-Level Results, before Kundai arrives here in India and completes the registration at the university. I hope this is clear?
29/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Clear
29/09/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
29/09/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Clear sir
29/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
29/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
29/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
29/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 329 9280: As parents who depend on farming and our monthly incomes come by the end of each month we are comfortable for payments by 25 October and 25 of November. Mid month payments are a challenge. Can dates be changed to meet our financial status please
29/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Or sir,if by the grace of God we get the money within stipulated dates we pay
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kundai!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in a meeting that came up. I appreciate your patience here, let us continue with our discussion.
30/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding what you have mentioned here, I completely understand that, however, as you can see that the university has given you a date of 13th October to make the payment of your registration fee, hence, we would have to abide by that. 

Moving ahead, for me to be able to help you with the same, can you please help me in understanding more about how is it that you are planning to raise the finances for Kundai's registration fee?
30/09/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 329 9280: Welcome sir.we understand. We are to borrow the first $300  then pay back  month end October and for November things will back in order.
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kundai!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since it was a long weekend and the team was not available. I appreciate your patience here.
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, I believe that you are now certain that you would be able to make the payment of the registration fee as per the deadline dates shared by the university, right?
03/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Yes please
03/10/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/10/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Outside Harare but only 60 km into the city
03/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Very accessible within an hour or so
03/10/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 329 9280: We stay in Glendale  60 km from Harare and 20km into Bindura
03/10/23, 3:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/10/23, 3:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/10/23, 3:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Thank you for sharing
03/10/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
03/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Yes  please in case of alternatives l will be safe from both sides
03/10/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
03/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Thank you sir
03/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
03/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 329 9280: It's good to hear this.
03/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 329 9280: We can proceed
03/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
03/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
03/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Yes please
03/10/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
03/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 329 9280: Thank you for the clarity
03/10/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
03/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 329 9280: For today let's conclude
03/10/23, 3:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
03/10/23, 3:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour
