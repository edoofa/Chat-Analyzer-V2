03/08/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 438 1218: It seems we both failed to connect, my apologies. I had some emergency and battery got drained while driving. If morning can work then will make an effort tomorrow morning
03/08/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Thanks for your usual support
03/08/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, may I know what is the challenge that you are facing. Since you were informed at the start the process is to be completed within 4 days of time, we have not been able to connect and have a smooth conversation to move forward with the admission Process?
03/08/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Kindly note that when I agreed to meet at 2pm, I thought I would make it. However I finished a meeting late, and power outage led us to lose connectivity, and then battery went flat. I have connected some 30 minutes ago and a checking messages, hence my response to you at this late stage.

Am not sure about the 4 days deadline, kindly tag where this was mentioned and I am lost as to where this applies. I understood that we shall connect once all required documentation has been submitted. Please enlighten me otherwise.
04/08/23, 12:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zvanakiraishe.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, I understand completely that you are busy with work and then due to power cuts you were not able to connect, however, in this way, the process is delayed a lot, and kindly excuse me for saying that it was informed to you that the process is to be completed within 4 days. However, Ideally, the process is to be completed in 4 days, now that you are aware, could you please let me know a time by when will you be available for the discussion?
04/08/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Today 2pm am available. Now I know the four days will start counting😚
04/08/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I shall wait for your response.
04/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 438 1218: If you are there and there as I indicated, Ms
04/08/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I am available, shall we proceed with the discussion?

04/08/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Ok
04/08/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 438 1218: The six stages have been understood. Thanks
04/08/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/08/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
04/08/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Cleared
04/08/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Clear
04/08/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/08/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Following
04/08/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
04/08/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
04/08/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Noted. Its clear
04/08/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
04/08/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Yes let's get it
04/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
04/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
04/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
04/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
04/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
04/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
04/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
04/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
04/08/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I do not have internet connection so let me do this tonight when I reach WIFi. Thanks so much for your time.
04/08/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 10.00 am, I hope you will be able to go through the videos by that time, and will be available.
08/08/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zvanakiraishe.

10/08/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 438 1218: Good morning.

We did not manage the four days due to a few reasons.

- power outage

17/08/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 673 0177: I learnt that edoofa is an institution that seeks to make the process of applying for university less tedious and give students a trustworthy  and safe framework to work in while pursuing higher education

I also learnt that there are unscrupulous agents who may mislead students simply for financial gain

I learnt also of the many universities edoofa is in contact with and the breadth of reach the program truly has

Lastly I learnt of the importance of the statement of entry and how pivotal it is in my application process
17/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Yes, precisely
17/08/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I am following from behind. Its noted. Thanks
17/08/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.
17/08/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

17/08/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, so can I anticipate that you will be able to fill out the SOP form, and complete the tasks by today 09.00 pm?
17/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 673 0177: That won't be possible, as I am yet to complete my A level examinations, hence I cannot hand in the results
17/08/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263776730177 I am aware of that, and that is why you can share the statement of entry for A- level if you have that because most of the students have them from now.
17/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Understood

Right now I do not have access to my statement of entry, however I may be able to obtain it by tomorrow

24/08/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 673 0177: 2. Data is the new oil. This statement holds immense truth in today's digital age. Just as oil fueled the industrial revolution, data is now the driving force behind innovation and progress. It has become a valuable resource that powers businesses, governments, and even individuals.

Data provides insights and knowledge that were previously unimaginable. It enables companies to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and deliver personalized experiences to customers. Governments can leverage data to improve public services and address societal challenges more effectively. Moreover, individuals can benefit from data-driven technologies that enhance their daily lives.

The value of data lies not only in its quantity but also in its quality. Just like oil needs to be refined before it becomes useful, data requires analysis and interpretation to unlock its potential. Companies must invest in advanced analytics tools and skilled professionals who can extract meaningful insights from vast amounts of information.

However, with great power comes great responsibility. Data privacy and security must be prioritized to ensure that this valuable resource is used ethically and responsibly. Regulations should be put in place to protect individuals' rights while still allowing for innovation.
24/08/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 673 0177: 3.It was a gloomy Saturday morning when I decided to tackle the daunting task of replacing the CMOS internal CPU battery in my computer. As a self-proclaimed tech enthusiast, I had always been fascinated by the inner workings of electronic devices. However, this particular endeavor seemed more challenging than anything I had attempted before.

With a sense of determination, I carefully unplugged all the cables and removed the side panel of my computer tower. The sight that greeted me was a labyrinth of wires and components, but there it was – the small silver coin-shaped battery nestled on the motherboard.

As I gingerly removed the old battery, memories flooded back to me. This computer had been with me through thick and thin – countless late-night gaming sessions, important school projects, and even some heartwarming video calls with loved ones who were far away.

With trembling hands, I inserted the new battery into its designated slot. It felt like breathing new life into an old friend. As soon as everything was reassembled and plugged back in, I pressed the power button with bated breath.

To my immense relief, my computer sprang back to life! The familiar hum filled the room as it booted up without any issues. It was a triumphant moment that left me feeling accomplished and proud.

Replacing that seemingly insignificant battery taught me an important lesson about perseverance and problem-solving. Sometimes we need to delve into unfamiliar territory to overcome challenges and achieve success. From that day forward, every time I turned on my computer, it served as a reminder of what can be accomplished with determination and a little bit of technical know-how.
24/08/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 673 0177: 4.Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the world of technology.

24/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions, I shall wait for your response to questions 1 and 5.
24/08/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Apologies, however I've labelled number 4 wrongly, it's supposed to be number 5
24/08/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for bringing that to my notice, I shall wait for your response to the rest of the academic questions.
24/08/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 673 0177: 4.Installing multiple operating systems on a single computer may seem like an unnecessary endeavor, but for technology enthusiasts like myself, it is an exciting challenge. Recently, I embarked on the adventure of installing three different operating systems simultaneously on my computer: Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The motivation behind this experiment was to explore the unique features and functionalities offered by each operating system. Windows is known for its user-friendly interface and extensive software compatibility. macOS, on the other hand, is renowned for its sleek design and seamless integration with Apple devices. Lastly, Linux offers unparalleled customization options and robust security features.

The installation process itself was complex but rewarding. It required partitioning my hard drive into separate sections for each operating system and configuring a boot manager to allow me to choose between them at startup. This allowed me to switch between the three systems effortlessly.

24/08/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions, it is duly noted with us. May I know by when will you be able to fill out the SOP form?
25/08/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zvanakiraishe.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. So I wanted to reach out and check if we are still connected?
25/08/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Apologies for the delay, I will fill out the form today by 1400
25/08/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, in that case, I shall wait for your response, I hope you will be available at 02.00 pm.
25/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 673 0177: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
25/08/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
25/08/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
25/08/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Yes, that is correct
25/08/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
25/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Yes
25/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 438 1218: This is well noted and I am fully behind my son's journey to complete the protocols.

Thanks you for your support, cooperation and patience during the second phase of the process.
25/08/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are in full support of your son's journey! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
25/08/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
25/08/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/08/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Of course, that would be ridiculous
25/08/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
25/08/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
25/08/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
25/08/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Yes, that we did
25/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2700-$3700 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
25/08/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Yes, understood
25/08/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
25/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Yes
25/08/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
25/08/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Yes I'm following
25/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
26/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 438 1218: I am sure the degree course has been Bachelor of Business Administration with Information Technology, unless if something changed along the way, which I missed. Please confirm.
26/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 438 1218: Noted

I hope you are doing well, thank you for submitting the EWYL pledge form, with regard to our conversation, in the personal window may I know if you and your parents are available to connect with us now?
14/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 673 0177: I am available today, unsure however about my parents
14/09/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, Now I believe you have had a discussion with your family regarding your admission process, so I would like to know if you have any queries or concerns to share?
14/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 673 0177: No queries thus far
14/09/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
14/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 438 1218: We aren't aware of such an opportunity, and kindly share with us. This is at a late hour in September, however let's hear what your offer entails.
14/09/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
14/09/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
14/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Very true
14/09/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
14/09/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 673 0177: Yes please
14/09/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
14/09/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 673 0177: No I was not <This message was edited>
14/09/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/09/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
14/09/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
15/09/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zvanakiraishe.

I hope you are doing well, I was expecting to connect with you yesterday, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

Can you ahead with your program as we may end up just missing these appointments, yet if there is an action needed, whenever we read and respond there will be progress. 

That's my two rupee contribution. Thanks
25/09/23, 4:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zvanakiraishe.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing that I understand that network is a big challenge, however, being a parent we would want your involvement in the admissions group as the student is not available. And since the discussion is important we do not wish to move forward without you being actively engaged. So please may I know by when will you be available to connect?
25/09/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Hello there. Is it possible to proceed with discussions for the completion of Rashwell's process.

Please take note from October to November 2023, Rashwell will be writing his Advanced level exams and may be committed to exam preps and may not be able to participate as we would all desire. Kindly accept this challenge on our side.

Regards,
25/09/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I understand that @263774381218 and many students are going to be unavailable because of the upcoming examination, and I completely understand that. However, the admissions group wants parents to be actively involved in the discussion if the students are going to be unavailable, hence I would appreciate you being involved in the admission group so that we move ahead with the Admission process as I do not wish Rashwell to be behind his peer's in the admission process. Daily one hour anytime from *12:30 p.m. to 04:00 p.m. and 07:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Monday to Friday as per Central African Time*, would be enough for our discussions.

I hope you understand?
25/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I hear you. I am going to be available but my son will be unavailable. As for me I said proceed sharing what needs to be discussed then I respond very day you share some issues for discussions. Thanks

25/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I promise to respond daily as the parent of Zvanakiraishe Rashwell
27/09/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zvanakiraishe.

I work in the farms where there is intermittent connectivity and am praying you will understand and just do as I have requested so many times. 

I am able to connect now, but no guarantee when you are online I am available. 

Thanks
05/10/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand what you are trying to say, sir, however, since now the discussion is about cost break down and hence I do not think that sharing the messages at once is the right way to discuss the cost, hence I would like to you be active for an hour time tomorrow so that we can complete our discussion please.
05/10/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I am sure I have said I am dealing with farmers, and I shall be in an area without network.

As you wish, if its not possible, then I am available - First thing early tomorrow morning 7:30-8:30am. Thereafter I shall not be available, my apologies.

 Thanks
06/10/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
06/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zvanakiraishe.

I hope you are doing well, I completely understand that where you work network can be an issue, however, I would like you to understand please as well that our available working hours are from 12:00 pm to 04:00 pm and 07:30 pm to 10:30 pm CAT and connecting before will not be available for me. With a time difference of 3.5 hours, we work late here in India till 02:00 am IST which is 10:30 pm CAT and we work this late to ensure that we are able to connect with the parents who are busy during the day with work.

I hope you understand?
06/10/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Noted. So what's the way forward on this. I am back from the field and feel free to connect from now till 10.30pm CAT.

Thanks
06/10/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Go ahead am done with what I was doing. You are welcome
06/10/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that may I know if you were able to go through Endowment benefits?
06/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Kindly explain Endowment benefits, my son did not have time to explain as she is at school. Thanks
06/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 438 1218: ...he is...
06/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. 1. On the basis of Zvanakiraishe's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his registration formalities, you will be presented with his Official Admission Letter with the help of which he will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
06/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263774381218 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
06/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Thanks for the clarity on Endowment benefit, its quite clear.

Please note, I have a SON, Zvanakiraishe Rashwell, he is not Blessing and not my daughter, seems there is some mix up some where. Kindly rectify. Thanks
06/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 438 1218: This is exciting. Thanks
06/10/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the typing error, I have corrected the same, please.
06/10/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/10/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/10/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Excellent
06/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
06/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Okay the grant comes into play for the Registration Fee, as stipulated by the University. Its clear.
06/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/10/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 438 1218: This part is clear. No question so far. Thanks
06/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/10/23, 8:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Zvanakiraishe.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are facing any challenges, since I noticed that you were able to go through my message?
07/10/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and a great weekend ahead.
07/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I am only checking messages from you now. Thanks. Will connect on Monday
09/10/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Zvanakiraishe.

I hope you are doing well. with regard to our conversation on Saturday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
09/10/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
10/10/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Zvanakiraishe.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to connect with you, however, you did not respond, I would appreciate it if you share your challenges with us here so that we can assist you accordingly. May I know if we are still connected @263774381218?
12/10/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening @263774381218 

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation over the personal window may I know if we can connect now to have a discussion?
12/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Ms Kirti, should you be available kindly proceed at this time. I have an hour if possible.
12/10/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Hi. Proceed
12/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Waiting....
12/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
12/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 438 1218: As earlier stated. Yes
12/10/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it is certainly possible since our available working hours are from *12:00 PM CAT to 04:00 PM CAT and 07.30 PM CAT to 10.30 PM CAT, Monday to Friday as per Central African Time*.
12/10/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Noted
12/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Not sure I remember discussion of this aspect. Clarity is better.
12/10/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/10/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
12/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Ok
12/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Noted
12/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Ok
12/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Affirmative
12/10/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
12/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Yaah
12/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Are you still there!!!
12/10/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Go on
12/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Ok
12/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
12/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 438 1218: OK. Go further
12/10/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 438 1218: So its not a refund arrangement?
12/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263774381218 Thank you for sharing your concern, could you please help me understand what according to you is a refund arrangement so that I can understand your thoughts better and then be able to help you understand?
12/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 438 1218: If child doesn't pass, I was made to understand there will be a refund of the $350 and the $750 or less. Thanks
12/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 438 1218: However this is not critical, let's proceed with where my son would have passed and has become an Edoofian. 

Kindly let's move on
12/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding. Allow me to clarify the refund policy: If, for any reason, we are unable to provide Zvanakiraishe's offer letter for higher education, only the $350 Edoofa program fee will be refunded to the parent. However, the focus here is on the admission process for your son, Mr. Goodson. Our organization is committed to ensuring the best for him and has introduced these benefits to safeguard his career. The final point comes into play only if the student decides not to reappear for A-level exams and opts not to pursue a diploma. It's an added advantage for him.

As you rightly mentioned, this situation is not likely to arise, and I believe he will make you proud. If you would like a more detailed explanation, I'd be happy to provide that when you're available.
12/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 438 1218: As already noted, kindly proceed as this is understood. Thanks
12/10/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I am happy to know that you are clear. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Proceed. My time will be up soon.
12/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 438 1218: 21.00
12/10/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Zvanakiraishe's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 70 students have now already secured their seats, leaving 30 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Zvanakiraishe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
12/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Yes
12/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take a week time to *evaluate his application* after which if they accept his application for a scholarship, they would send him a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
12/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Ok
12/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a blessed night Mr. Goodson.
12/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Goodnight
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Zvanakiraishe.

15/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Zvanakiraishe!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I am sure you did not read my above comment. Tjanks
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please that is not true, I have gone through the message that you had shared here, and I would surely help you in understanding the same please. 

When it comes to the specialization, i.e. BBA IT, it is included in the normal BBA course itself please but is not included in the nomenclature please. I hope this is clear?
15/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Its something we wanna be sure of as this was clear during the Counselling phase. Thank you
15/10/23, 9:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. I believe you are clear about that now, right?
15/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 438 1218: As you say. Let's move on.
15/10/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now please?
15/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Yes I did
15/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 438 1218: It will be great to see the course offerings for BBA. THANKS
15/10/23, 9:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 438 1218: 1/ $900
2/ 3Years
3/ $300 (waived for early registrations)
4/ $750
15/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 438 1218: If you have gone away sir, just advise. Thanks
15/10/23, 10:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Proceed
15/10/23, 10:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 10:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 10:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Clear
15/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Welcome
15/10/23, 10:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Yeah
15/10/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
15/10/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 438 1218: As read in Offer Letter so far so good
15/10/23, 10:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
15/10/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Yeah
15/10/23, 10:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 10:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 10:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Clear sir Milan proceed.
15/10/23, 10:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/10/23, 10:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/10/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I reside outside Harare some 100km and have access to Harare within less than 2 hours
15/10/23, 10:41 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Precisely Mvurwi town
15/10/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I do have a forex bank account yes
15/10/23, 10:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/10/23, 10:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/10/23, 10:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/10/23, 10:59 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Ok
15/10/23, 11:00 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Noted
15/10/23, 11:00 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Contact received
15/10/23, 11:02 pm - +263 77 438 1218: My battery is about to die, let me sleep its 23.00hrs. Thanks for your time and effort. Will connect later
15/10/23, 11:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, we will connect with each other tomorrow please.
15/10/23, 11:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Night! 🌛
15/10/23, 11:03 pm - +263 77 438 1218: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Zvanakiraishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can continue with our conversation here now?
17/10/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Zvanakiraishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter. May I know by when can we reconnect with each other here for the same please?
19/10/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Zvanakiraishe!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Zvanakiraishe!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
20/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Good evening Mr Singh
20/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I have been out in the farms where there is no connectivity. Kindly go ahead and advise next steps
20/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I understand
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Zvanakiraishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting to connect with you here for the past few days, but since you were unable to do so, I was concerned that if everything is alright. Now, is everything fine please?
20/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Am back in town with network connection. Fyne
20/10/23, 8:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Shall we proceed?
20/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Waiting
20/10/23, 8:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 438 1218: However Mr Rajan appears a better alternative from the 12.5% versus his 7%.
20/10/23, 9:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Indeed he is, but let me share the details here for reference. 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
20/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Thanks
20/10/23, 9:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Following
20/10/23, 9:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/10/23, 9:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Yes
20/10/23, 9:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Very clear
20/10/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Thanks. Does that mean the offer letter shall only be from one University? I had understood we shall be able to have more to make a choice from what's on offer.
20/10/23, 9:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
20/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Clear
20/10/23, 9:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Clear. Pliz proceed
20/10/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 438 1218: We do not have issues yet with any Uni you will link us up with, my question was on having a choice. Transfers are in order. Kindly proceed.
20/10/23, 9:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is what I want to help you in understanding. Are you aware of the transfer option?
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Not sure.
20/10/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/10/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Okay
20/10/23, 10:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you do have clarity on the matter and you understand how the admission process is navigated, right?
20/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Clear
20/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Yes
20/10/23, 10:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, do you have any other queries please?
20/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Not at all
20/10/23, 10:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/10/23, 10:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

20/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Excellent
20/10/23, 10:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
20/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Great. Good night. Tomorrow then.
21/10/23, 8:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Zvanakiraishe!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Zvanakiraishe!
I hope you are doing well today.

I Was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University. Now, moving ahead, shall we continue with our conversation here about the same?

23/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Proceed
23/10/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, were you able to have a discussion about the offer letter with the famliy?
23/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Yeah
23/10/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please, what were your thoughts on the same?
23/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 438 1218: It's doable and should we have a better offer like above 50% scholarship we can transfer at no additional cost as what we would have paid would suffice. So it's acceptable to the family.
23/10/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
23/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 438 1218: The family has been focused on supporting our children for higher education. A brother to Zvanakiraishe Rashwell went to China some years ago, bit we pulled him back due to covid19
23/10/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about your positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?

I'm here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
23/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 438 1218: I just read and watched the materials shared. It's a great place I guess and there is multiculturalism based on the nationalities participating in video clips as shared
23/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 438 1218: There were flags including that of Zimbabwe 🇿🇼
23/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Facilities are world class
23/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 438 1218: The various schools offer variety and the one for Business is well represented

23/10/23, 2:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I’m sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat.
 
Now, since the university has given you a date of 28th October to complete the registration process, you have two options to do that, one is a $300 payment, and the other is a single payment of $600. Have you had a chance to consider which payment plan you'd like to proceed with?
23/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 438 1218: We are looking at the $300 instalment option
23/10/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share the same information with the university officials as well.
24/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Well noted
24/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 438 1218: We can chat

21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents and Zvanakiraishe!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Since the deadline date is just around the corner, I wanted to reach out to you to understand the current status of your financial preparations for this crucial opportunity? Have you been able to raise the balance amount of $340 by now and finalize the date on when you are going to make the payment of your fee?
28/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 438 1218: Dear Ashi,

My son has the money but appears he is no longer in the group, not sure what happened. 

When I said the deadline is today, he indicated he can only be in the bank tomorrow morning. 

My apologies on that delay, however kindly reinstate Zvanakiraishe Rashwell for him to be in the loop on discussions herein.

Waiting for your guidance.

Regards
