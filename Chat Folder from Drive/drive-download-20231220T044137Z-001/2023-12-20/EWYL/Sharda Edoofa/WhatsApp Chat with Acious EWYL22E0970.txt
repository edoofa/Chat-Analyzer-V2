It brings me great joy to welcome you to today's scheduled session. 

Let's make the most of this time and engage in meaningful discussions.
So, are you ready for today’s session?
23/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Yes I'm ready
23/08/23, 3:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It's time to wrap up today's session 

Your commitment to learning shines bright. 

Reflect on the insights gained, and get ready to dive into new horizons tomorrow.
23/08/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Okay ma'am, thank you, I'll be waiting for tomorrow's session
24/08/23, 2:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Go through this newsletter and let me know once you are done reading it. Okay?
24/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Yes it's all Clear
24/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 688 9307: I'm done
24/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Okay noted, so does It mean I have to bring the answers by tomorrow
24/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Hello ma'am I'm done
24/08/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes
24/08/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
24/08/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Well, I'll surely bring them before our scheduled time
24/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 688 9307: "No one reads history anymore. It's all there. Time will change. There will be no
warning when they do. And those that can play offense when they do gain
more in a few years than a decade of normal times.
"What gets in the way of being positioned for a crisis?"- The short answer is
human nature.
"Being properly positioned means going slower." It means less leverage. It
means more buffers and margins of safety. It means taking a generational
view, not a quarterly view. It means looking like an idiot when times are good."
Then he paused and looked at me, offering perhaps the most valuable part of
today's lesson.
"What people don't realize is that when you find yourself in the right position,
you have opportunities others can't even imagine."
Master your circumstances rather than be ruled by them.
24/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 688 9307: To my side, this was too deep 🙂
24/08/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
24/08/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Indeed it was deep and informative.
24/08/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

28/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Factors that one must consider when searching for a company that can collaborate with EDOOFA include nature of the company, scale of the company, financial stability of the company and the background of the founder. Then there are the steps along with keeping the factors into consideration which starts by searching about the company, followed by taking a study about the company and its function. The next step is to study the website of the company and If the company functions through an app get the link of the app, download it and check if it is user-friendly, study its reviews on play store. One must also check the various social media pages of the company, this gives the idea of the activities of the company functioning status. After implementing the above factors,one is supposed to know more about the Founder and other core members. After checking the background of people associated with the company, start reaching out 
to them by dropping an invitation note and sending a connection request  to various departments before connecting with the Founders
28/08/23, 3:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You know what Acious, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

08/09/23, 2:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _Through WhatsApp community groups_
08/09/23, 2:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
08/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Okay ma'am
08/09/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Looking forward to your understanding of the same.
08/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 688 9307: The most effective way for community building is to create a whatsapp group and then identify the right students to join the WhatsApp group. The goal is to provide then with the information about Edoofa. To find the right students I have to identity my classmates who are currently in form 6 or those who have finished their form 6's or those who are still doing thief A level. Once the students join the group,  I have to share the information about the Edoofa program including its affordability and making dreams alive for most students. I have to create a group of minimum of 60 students and I have to add you first so as to track my progress and providing guidance if networking.
08/09/23, 3:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Acious, I am impressed with your understanding.
08/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Thank you ma'am

11/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 688 9307: I'm following
11/09/23, 2:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 2:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
11/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Okay sure
11/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 688 9307: I have to reach out to local schools in my region, meeting headmasters and inform them about the Edoofa program. I can start with my former school connecting with the principle and tell him why I joined Edoofa or how I plan my future. I would then ask them if they would like to share a ppmeeting online with the Edoofa program director. I then share the same about the principle  with the EWYL  program mentor. All I have to do is to arrange a meeting between the local school head and the Edoofa, and I should use a cover letter which I should use to initiate a conversation with the principle or headmaster
11/09/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Acious.

​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
11/09/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.

11/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Yes yes
11/09/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great!

11/09/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
11/09/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
12/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Sorry for being late
12/09/23, 3:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is alright for now Acious. Please take care of your health. It is important.
12/09/23, 3:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:

Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
12/09/23, 3:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:

It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
12/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 688 9307: Yes I do agree
12/09/23, 4:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
12/09/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 688 9307: That's very clear
12/09/23, 4:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
12/09/23, 4:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],
I hope you are in good health and high spirits.
I am writing to you as a proud beneficiary of the esteemed _Edoofa Scholarship Program_ and I feel privileged to have the opportunity to connect with you today.

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 12:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

*Punctuality Matters:* Aim to join the line 5 minutes early, confirming your readiness. This small gesture ensures we make the most of our scheduled sessions and unlocks undiscovered benefits.
