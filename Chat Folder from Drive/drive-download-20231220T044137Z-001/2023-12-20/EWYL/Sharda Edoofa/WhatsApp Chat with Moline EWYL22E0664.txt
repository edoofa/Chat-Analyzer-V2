03/10/23, 8:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 3:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
11/10/23, 4:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.
11/10/23, 4:06 pm - +91 84379 37842: I've have found 3 students who wants to join But unfortunately I don't have the offline application form
11/10/23, 4:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then *give them resources and information about Edoofa*. 
*Train them about the process* so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, *we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.*
11/10/23, 4:06 pm - +91 84379 37842: Can you please send me the form ma'am

25/10/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Juniors Connect:*

25/10/23, 3:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *School Friends Juniors Connect:*

25/10/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.

If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
25/10/23, 3:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following the discussion, moline?
25/10/23, 3:47 pm - +91 84379 37842: Yes ma'am I am

25/10/23, 3:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
25/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In order to ensure the success of every task, *it's important to establish clear goals*. I'd like to work with you to define some specific goals based on the following criteria:
Kindly answer the following questions :

*2* This week and up until our next session, how many student application forms are you planning to submit?
25/10/23, 4:04 pm - +91 84379 37842: Okay ma'am

25/10/23, 4:05 pm - +91 84379 37842: About 5 students
25/10/23, 4:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moline, kindly answer each question separately.
25/10/23, 4:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Setting goals is the first step to success. Let's aim to interact with *5*students before our next session and help submit *5* application forms.

25/10/23, 4:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before we end our today’s discussion, I wanted to remind you about the task we discussed in our recent conversations, which involves *writing reviews on Google and Facebook*. Completing this task is important because it allows you to share your feedback effectively and also helps you become more familiar with these social media platforms.

Complete the tasks by today *11:00pm*. Once done, *share the screenshots* of both Google and Facebook review.
25/10/23, 7:56 pm - +91 84379 37842: Okay ma'am
27/10/23, 4:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moline, it has been while since I have been constantly reminding of the due video that was supposed to be done long time ago.
I hope you understand that I take extra time out of my schedule just to check your performance and share reminders to you so that you do not miss out on opportunities that other students are receiving by completing the assigned tasks to them on a regular and timely basis. 

I hope you consider this a priority and share your video latest by tomorrow. If you feel that this task is not important, I encourage you to share your concerns transparently with me so that I can explain the objective of it in the first place.
03/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening *Moline*
I hope you are doing well.

Since we had our call scheduled on Saturday and you also acknowledged the message regarding the same. I would like to understand the reason behind you not being available for the call.

Also, as you must already be aware about our planned schedule for our calls and sessions that was established well in advance. Hence it is challenging to continually adjust and reschedule our timetable.

06/12/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let's also explore the progress of the projects you've been actively engaged in. Let's start with the Community Building Project.
In this initiative, you're reaching out to build a community and share Edoofa opportunities.
06/12/23, 2:37 pm - +91 84379 37842: Okay ma'am
06/12/23, 2:38 pm - +91 84379 37842: I've been trying
06/12/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: How's it going? I'm keen to know how much work you've put into it.
How many students have you interacted with so far?
And what are the exact difficulties or challenges that you are facing while working on the project?
06/12/23, 2:45 pm - +91 84379 37842: Recently I have 1 new student that I have been communicating with
06/12/23, 2:45 pm - +91 84379 37842: And yet to fill the application form
06/12/23, 2:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright, Moline. This is a great progress.
06/12/23, 2:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: And what are the exact difficulties or challenges that you are facing while working on the project?
06/12/23, 2:47 pm - +91 84379 37842: Most of the school I've been targeting already know about edoofa and some are not interested in studying abroad
06/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern. It's not uncommon to face situations where students may already be familiar with Edoofa or are not immediately interested in studying abroad. Let's approach this challenge in a practical and logical manner:
06/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Understanding the Landscape:
It's great that you've identified that many students are already aware of Edoofa. This means that you're working in an environment where the brand recognition exists. Now, the focus can shift towards addressing specific concerns or misconceptions
06/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Tailor Your Message:
Since some students may not be initially interested in studying abroad, consider tailoring your message to highlight other aspects of the Edoofa experience. This could include the mentorship program, career guidance, or the unique educational opportunities provided.
06/12/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Understand the reasons behind their lack of interest. Are there specific concerns or barriers that you can address? By identifying and addressing these pain points, you can make the value proposition more relevant to their individual needs.
06/12/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Highlight what makes Edoofa stand out. Whether it's the personalized mentorship, quality of education, or the global exposure offered, emphasizing unique selling points can make Edoofa more appealing to those who may initially be hesitant.
06/12/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Share success stories of students who were initially skeptical but later found immense value in the Edoofa program. Real-life examples can be powerful motivators and help potential applicants see the tangible benefits.
06/12/23, 2:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Changing perceptions takes time. Be patient and persistent in your efforts. Continuous engagement and reinforcement of key messages can gradually influence opinions.
06/12/23, 2:57 pm - +91 84379 37842: Okay ma'am understood
06/12/23, 2:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright.
06/12/23, 3:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moving on to the African School Reform project. Reforming local schools aligns with community development and your personal growth goals, like enhancing communication and negotiation skills.

How many school headmasters have you interacted with, and what challenges  have you faced?
06/12/23, 3:09 pm - +91 84379 37842: I tried interacting with 2 headmaster one from Harare high and another one from St kilian's and they said that the project is already at their schools
06/12/23, 3:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you for your proactive efforts in engaging with the headmasters of Harare High and St Kilian's. It's promising to hear that the Edoofa project is already present at their schools. This indicates that there's already awareness and potentially ongoing participation.
06/12/23, 3:11 pm - +91 84379 37842: Yes ma'am
06/12/23, 3:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While these schools already have the Edoofa project, consider expanding your efforts to other schools in the area. Your role as an ambassador involves reaching as many students as possible, and there may be additional opportunities in schools that are not yet involved.
06/12/23, 3:11 pm - +91 84379 37842: Getting their contacts is the challenge
06/12/23, 3:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our lesson with a promise to learn two amazing skills this week!

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

13/12/23, 1:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Wednesday, Moline🌻

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,

14/12/23, 8:21 am - +91 84379 37842: Okay ma'am
15/12/23, 3:21 pm - +91 84379 37842: From the Wednesday wisdom I learnt about the significance of two virtues that are virtue of hard work and virtue of honesty. 
From the virtue of hardwork I understood that time management is very important as well as dedication in whatever Task that is assigned to you especially in college.Success also works hand in hand with hardwork so in order to be successful a lot of hard work is required as well as commitment. A lot of responsibilities comes in college hence students are said to be trained to tackle problems in the professional world later

The virtue of honesty says that one should be able to set goals that are achievable as per personal limitations. One should be able to submit his/her own without any dishonesty means involved. It helps in bringing the sense of pride when a task is accomplished well. It also enhances personal growth.
15/12/23, 4:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Find tomorrow's Saturday Activity in advance*
