29/09/23, 12:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: Dear Panashe,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Jasmine your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Jasmine's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.
29/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 773 1317: Thank you so much Ms Tenzin, wish you the best as well.

15/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 773 1317: As I understand more and more about Edoofas' vision that is when I realised that if I work well with it I will be a successful person in my career.

15/12/23, 9:59 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That's wonderful, Panashe. I'm curious, have you discussed any topics with your previous mentor from the EWYL Program? Can you recall any specific details or insights from those conversations?
15/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 773 1317: An apology it has been so long and in that way we have discussed not much because my mentors were being changed in a few days

15/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 773 1317: Very well in what I know I will tell you
15/12/23, 10:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, you are already aware of the EWYL Program. If so, can you provide me with some information about it?
