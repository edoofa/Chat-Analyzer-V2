24/08/23, 7:55 am - Aditi Edoofa added you
24/08/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 911 4587 joined using this group's invite link
24/08/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Dear Mentor, my name is Tavongashe Duve and my EWYL group name is Tavongashe EWYL23E0511.I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
24/08/23, 1:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Tavongashe, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor* now.
24/08/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 911 4587: I'm doing well thank you for asking I hope you are well too
24/08/23, 1:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
24/08/23, 1:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
24/08/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 911 4587: I will make the most out of this program and you working with me will be a rewarding experience
24/08/23, 1:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I can assure you that it would be a fruitful journey.
24/08/23, 1:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
24/08/23, 1:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Thank you for welcoming me into the EWYL I hope I'm going to learn a lot from you
24/08/23, 1:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I will make sure that you make the most out of this journey.
24/08/23, 1:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I kindly ask you to invite your parents to join the group so that they can _actively participate in your progress and share in the achievements you will make._ I am providing you with the link once again so that you can extend the invitation to them. Once your parents have joined the group, we can embark on this thrilling journey together!

24/08/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Can you explain the two key objectives
24/08/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!  
Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
24/08/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
24/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 911 4587: I do understand now
24/08/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's great!
24/08/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
24/08/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 911 4587: This is so great. I've read the same
24/08/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
24/08/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
24/08/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Thank you for introducing me to them
24/08/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, you're welcome.
24/08/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
24/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 911 4587: This is very interesting
24/08/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know on
ce you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

25/08/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
25/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes and I learnt of the skills of leadership in helping those in the community so I would like to be part of it
25/08/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is great!
25/08/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!

25/08/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussions you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

25/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes I am ready

01/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
01/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

01/09/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
01/09/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
01/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Ok
01/09/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
01/09/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
01/09/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

01/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

We'll continue our sessions starting next Monday, from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and they will take place every weekday.

Until then, enjoy your weekend! 🌸

04/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 911 4587: But now we don't have form 5 class at my school
04/09/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

04/09/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
04/09/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
04/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes that's true
04/09/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*

08/09/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully <This message was edited>
08/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 911 4587: I understand
08/09/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
08/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 911 4587: I will create the platforms and send them to you
08/09/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that would be appreciated.

08/09/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, sure!
08/09/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
08/09/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.

16/09/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Tavongashe!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 911 4587: I can take option 2

I trust you're doing well.

I'm currently in a crucial meeting and need to reschedule our session for 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM.
May I know why haven't you acknowledged my last message yet, are you facing any challenges?

08/10/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Kindly accept my apologies on behalf of Tavongashe. I will meet him Monday 8 October and iron out the problem.

Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
11/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Tuesday and Thursday
11/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright!
11/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
11/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
11/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Noted

11/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
11/10/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*. <This message was edited>

Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.
02/11/23, 4:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.

06/12/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
06/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Tuesday and Friday
06/12/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Noted.
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

06/12/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
06/12/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Tavongashe, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
