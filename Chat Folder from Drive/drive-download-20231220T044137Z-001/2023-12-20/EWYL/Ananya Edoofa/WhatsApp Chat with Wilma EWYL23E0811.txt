Thank you
14/12/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
14/12/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 756 5183: Thank you madam. I must say I am greatly inspired and even more excited to be working with you Ms Ananya!!
14/12/23, 10:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, Wilma! Now, get ready with your introduction as we are going to connect tomorrow at 1:30 pm, and I am so excited to learn more about you!🌟
14/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 756 5183: The feeling is mutual🫱🏾‍🫲🏾Have a good day.
15/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Wilma!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 756 5183: 😂🫱🏾‍🫲🏾 Good afternoon madam

Thank you for the amazing fact. I will keep that in mind considering that bananas are my favorite fruits!
15/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely!Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
15/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Of course

I am seventeen years old and I learn at ZRP High School, which is a well reputable school in Zimbabwe.Unlike most girls I am very tenacious and ambitious. I'm quite charismatic, confident and hardworking. My strength mainly lies in debate and public speaking thus I can say I am a lawyer in the making. Apart from that, my main goal is to be powerful and influential.
I am passionate about sports irregardless of the fact that I am passive, I still love to watch a good game. As well I am keen about gymnastics since I am a gymnast myself and very much into singing as that I can do as well

Thank you
15/12/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Being a future lawyer, huh? Debate and public speaking must be your superpowers. 💬💪 And aiming for power and influence – that's the spirit! Keep aiming high!

Sports fan, even if you're more on the passive side? That's amazing. What's your favorite sport to watch? And gymnastics! Wow, being a gymnast yourself is brilliant. Do you have a favorite move or routine?

And singing too? That's a diverse set of talents! What kind of music do you enjoy belting out? Keep rocking those ambitions! 🚀✨ <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Yes I find arguing for the right reasons and otherwise, quite intriguing! I like to think of it as a battle of mental supremacy😂

Yes when it comes to soccer mainly I am big supporter on Manchester City, it is unfortunate however that running is not  my strength 💔
When it comes to gymnastics I enjoy splits, they offer some sort of relaxation. 

In terms of music I listen to anything that is good to the ears 😂🫱🏾‍🫲🏾 I'm not very specific on genre.I appreciate that the art of music accommodates diversity. <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It's great to hear about your interests and preferences!🌟
15/12/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 756 5183: No madam
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 756 5183: OK, thank you madam
15/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
15/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Thank you Ms Ananya for acquainting me with everyone else.
15/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
15/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Yes, definitely exciting
15/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

15/12/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude our session today. Since we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, let's plan to reconnect on Monday!🌟
15/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 756 5183: OK madam. _Have a great weekend!!_
18/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Good day Madam
18/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Wilma?
18/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 756 5183: That sound terrific Madame.... Thank you so much

18/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 756 5183: I understood that the program enhances both personal growth and communal growth. Individually, I will be benefitting financially, socially as well as gaining technical experience.
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 756 5183: I will also be reaching out to influencial people inoder to make connections with them as well as marketing Edoofa.

18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 756 5183: I'm being encouraged to start my LinkedIn account and to interact with business officials. The audio is also appealing to my social reserve as well, I am being encouraged to be firmiliar with relatives as well as neighbors for advertisement, but above all Im being trained for skills I will apply after university. <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks, Wilma I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

18/12/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time so that we can proceed with our EWYL projects and earn credits!🌟🎄
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 756 5183: The guide talks about how one can find suitable companies and how it is important to make a background check on the founder of the company. It also highlights the key words when searching for a company and encourages the edoofian to interact with managers of various departments before the founder
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 756 5183: OK madam good day

19/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good day, Wilma! 🎄☀️

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. 🧦✨
Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? 😊🎁
19/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Honestly, I want to enquire on the companies I can consult. Would it be ok if I reached out to all profitable companies with promising  social cooperate services? <This message was edited>
