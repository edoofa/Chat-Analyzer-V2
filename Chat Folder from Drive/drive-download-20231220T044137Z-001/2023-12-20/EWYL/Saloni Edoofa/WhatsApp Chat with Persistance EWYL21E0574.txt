I am Ms. Sanjana, Head of Dept, EWYL. I hope that you are doing well and keeping safe.
04/10/23, 11:04 am - +91 74284 45625: First and foremost, we truly appreciate your patience. I was monitoring your conversations with Ms. Saloni and also had a series of discussions with her regarding your performance in the community building project recently.

For the feedback of these student applications, as we were approaching the closing of applications for 2023, our team had been diligently focusing on a selective number of applications to ensure thorough evaluation of the students who were found eligible for the program. This inadvertently led to certain number of applications, including yours, being scheduled slightly later than others. The exact segregation of the same will be shared by Ms. Saloni so that you have a fair idea of their current statuses.

To update you for the forms that are yet to be contacted, our counselling team will be reaching out to you and the few remaining students within the next 7 days.
04/10/23, 11:05 am - +91 74284 45625: I have always appreciated your intent and initiative towards seeking proactive feedback. I would be happy to see you working in a similar manner moving further.
All the best!
04/10/23, 11:26 am - +91 70879 73863: The students will be sitting for their final exams this year itself and anticipating to join the universities in 2024.

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the takers  Scholarship? I learnt that a fully funded scholarship is a scholarship in which a government body sponsors a student completely, and most people assume that scholarships are like Charity that is distributed which is not in the case of Edoofa and Scholarships. I also found out that every African student has a dream of having a fully funded scholarships like me, which is sad because a very small fraction of students are able to attain a fully funded scholarship, because there are very few genuine charitable organizations.
In addition I also learnt that Edoofa can help with scholarship by accessing the most prestigious universities of your choice, not only that I also came to realisation that as a student they will get me skilled in the line of course that I will be taking and also by finding me a job through a structured practical training and internship. In short I discovered that they will stay with me as a student throughout my academic life as mentors and care takers the list does not end I will mention only but a few. 

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words) Firstly, it's a prestigious program that can open up many opportunities for me. Secondly, the program offers unique experiences and challenges that will help me grow as a person. Third, the program is designed to help me develop my skills and knowledge in a way that will prepare me for my future career. Fourth, the program provides a supportive community of like-minded individuals who will help me through the program and beyond. Finally, the program is an investment in my future that will pay off in the long run.

What I learnt about the EDOOFA Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the EDOOFA Scholarship 
Edoofa program solves the problems if Affordability and Employability in Higher Education by enabling students to Earn Scholarship Credits and Learning 21st century job skills

Why I should be accepted into the Edoofa program

The program has quality education that is accessible to all and not just the privileged of a few. Through the Scholarship program, Edoofa solves both problems, that of lack of Affordability and Employability in Higher Education.thats all I have learnt.

08/11/23, 6:29 am - +91 70879 73863: Good morning Ma'am 
How are you?
08/11/23, 6:30 am - +91 70879 73863: Did you receive an update?
08/11/23, 10:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Persistance!
How are you?
08/11/23, 10:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
08/11/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I asked them and they are asking for the dates when you shared their forms. This is just to cross-verify because in the last few months, this happened that a lot of forms very commonly shared by multiple students just changing interchanging their first name and last name and what not.
08/11/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: Would that be possible if you can do that?
08/11/23, 11:28 am - +91 70879 73863: I shared the forms on the 30th of October and 1st of November,  ma'am
09/11/23, 8:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Persistance!
How are you?
09/11/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Noted, I have shared the same with the Program Director.
10/11/23, 2:34 am - +91 70879 73863: Okay ma'am
10/11/23, 2:39 am - +91 70879 73863: Good morning Ma'am 
How are you doing, today?

Ma'am I wanted to ask if it's possible for me to redeem 27000rupees of my credits for my rentals.  We as a family faced some financial issues last month and I wasn't able to pay my rent in time.
14/11/23, 12:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Persistance!
How are you?
14/11/23, 12:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay in responding, the organization was closed on Friday till Monday on the occasion of Diwali festivity.
14/11/23, 12:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will have to ask, let me confirm the same from Ms. Sanjana.
14/11/23, 12:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You referred a student named Darlington.

Darlington is a student admitted to Galgotias University and was supposed to come to India this month and secured his visa as well, however, he got concerned with the fee that he needs to pay after his arrival ($250 for the tuition fee and the accommodation expenses) and ended up not booking his flight ticket. 
Can you please check with him what is the status and how would be like to move ahead?
15/11/23, 5:43 am - +91 70879 73863: No worries ma'am
15/11/23, 5:43 am - +91 70879 73863: Sure
15/11/23, 5:44 am - +91 70879 73863: Kindly share his contact number with me
15/11/23, 5:45 am - +91 70879 73863: I'm still waiting for this ma'am
15/11/23, 8:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Persistance!
How are you?
15/11/23, 8:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: +263 78 973 3211
15/11/23, 8:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I will share it by evening.
15/11/23, 8:24 am - +91 70879 73863: I'm fine ma'am 
How about you
15/11/23, 8:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
15/11/23, 8:30 am - +91 70879 73863: Ma'am, I've been receiving numerous messages from students expressing their concerns about submissions made one to two months ago, yet surprisingly, there hasn't been any follow-up. It's crucial to note, ma'am, that some students lack patience, and with several agencies facilitating student arrivals directly in India, they might opt for alternative agents if this issue persists.
15/11/23, 8:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I can completely understand the same Persistance, I am trying my level best right now. Don't worry at all!
15/11/23, 8:41 am - +91 70879 73863: Alright, ma'am
15/11/23, 8:42 am - +91 70879 73863: Any feedback from Ms Sanjana?
15/11/23, 9:14 am - +91 70879 73863: Ma'am, the confusion arose when Darlington was informed by the admission officer that he needed to pay the remaining balance of about $1250 in two installments, with $625 due upon his arrival to commence his studies. This came as a surprise to him and his family, as they had already made extensive preparations for his departure, including booking his flight ticket. When he raised concerns about the short notice and the $625 payment, the Admission Officer admitted to an error, stating that only $250 was required to cover this semester's fees and enable Darlington to begin his studies. However, due to the confusion and uncertainty, his parents opted to cancel the ticket.
15/11/23, 3:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have shared the same with the admission team.
15/11/23, 3:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also, for the same, write the mail to me, Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Deepali.
And then you are supposed to meet Mr. Rithvik for the same.
15/11/23, 4:10 pm - +91 70879 73863: Alright ma'am 
Thank you
15/11/23, 4:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Persistance, you can meet Mr. Rithvik tomorrow from 10 AM - 5 PM at Block 39, room 309.
15/11/23, 4:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: On this, may I know what is their future plan and what are parents' view on the same?
15/11/23, 4:21 pm - +91 70879 73863: Alright, ma'am 
I'll definitely meet him
15/11/23, 4:24 pm - +91 70879 73863: I've been informed that since they canceled the ticket, they'll need to rebook it as they are adamant that Darlington must come this year without further delay
