I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

03/10/23, 12:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
03/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 329 4485: Noted but the student is at school whereby they don't allow phones i don't know how best can we do

03/10/23, 12:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
03/10/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
03/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Have you done this?

While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.

I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
14/12/23, 9:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

14/12/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 759 7158: Yes l did
14/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 71 759 7158: I understood the outlined 6 steps of looking for the right companies that can collaborate with Edoofa.In my search l should take note of the following consideration
1nature of company
2scale of company
3financial stability and lastly background of founder
14/12/23, 9:38 am - +263 71 759 7158: Platforms such as Linked In and social media platforms eg facebook can be used as sources of information
14/12/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, let me summarize the same for you!
14/12/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​
14/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 71 759 7158: So all these companies should be technologically driven irrespective of what they do..
14/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 759 7158: On number 4 does that mean suppose the company deals with food it has to be a seller not a manufacturer of the food?
14/12/23, 9:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is not a compulsion, Karen
14/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 759 7158: Okay l understand
14/12/23, 9:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can be anything, the emphasis is not on that.
14/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 71 759 7158: So what is the emphasis on?
14/12/23, 9:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: The emphasis is on getting student-centric companies and reaching out to them through the right way🫶🏻
14/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 71 759 7158: Okay now that's clear
