As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (31-Oct-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
01/11/23, 10:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Blessing and parents!
How are you?
01/11/23, 10:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: I regret to inform you that I won't be available for the session at that particular time due to previously scheduled commitments. However, I propose an alternative solution – your parents can attend the session on your behalf. During this session, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the program structure and its core components, ensuring that they, as parents, gain a clear understanding of the program.
01/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 244 4639: Noted will attend the session on his behalf
01/11/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: That will be great, I am delighted to begin from today onwards for these blissful sessions!
01/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session✨
01/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 244 4639: yes you can proceed
01/11/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know why are you late for the session?
01/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 244 4639: My sincere apologies had a meeting at work
01/11/23, 3:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would be very happy if you could come for the sessions in time. I understand your commitment at work but these sessions are equally important since you will be following and making the ground clear for Blessing.
01/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 857 7395: Note ma'am
01/11/23, 3:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure you will be there tomorrow.
01/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 857 7395: yah i will be there
03/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 244 4639: Hello are the sessions still on or they were cancelled?
07/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 244 4639: You can elaborate on them
07/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 244 4639: The one we know is that it reduces the fees payable by student thats lessening the burden on parents
07/11/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely true!
07/11/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
07/11/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
07/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 244 4639: Helpful to students indeed.
07/11/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
07/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 244 4639: Noted nice to interact with you ladies
07/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 244 4639: Hope the journey will be fruitful to both of bus
07/11/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, it will be amazing and really learning!
07/11/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
07/11/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?* '
07/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 244 4639: Yes thats interesting
07/11/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Blessing’s  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
07/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 244 4639: Sounds great
07/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Blessing will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
07/11/23, 4:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
07/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 244 4639: Noted we meet and interact again tomorrow.
08/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
08/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 244 4639: yes we may proceed
08/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Blessing can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
08/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 244 4639: noted
08/11/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know. <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 244 4639: we take note like i told you before the proposed time of the session my child will be still at school finishes off at 3pm.  Thats why we asked for the session to be rescheduled and you declined saying as a parent i should do the session.
08/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 244 4639: Its fine with me that you do the sesssion with Blessing not me thats how he can learn but he can only be available after 3pm Mondays to Fridays.
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Blessing takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Blessing is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 244 4639: noted thanks
08/11/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
08/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 244 4639: noted will meet again tomorrow
09/11/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
09/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 244 4639: Good day we have power outages in our area so was facing network challenges
09/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 244 4639: We may start the session if still possible
09/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, we will begin.
09/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
09/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
09/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
09/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
09/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
09/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
09/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 244 4639: Noted do us as parents need to use the EWYL line too?
09/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, you need to do this on behalf of Blessing!
09/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 244 4639: Noted thanks
09/11/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As we conclude for the day, I'd like to inform you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all are looking forward to celebrating Diwali with our family and this is why our next session is scheduled for Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!
