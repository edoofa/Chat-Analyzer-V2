08/12/23, 9:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: Great job on submitting the forms! I've forwarded it to our dedicated counseling team. Now, let's keep the momentum going by staying in close touch with the students and promptly addressing any questions or concerns they might have. Together, we're making a positive impact! 🌟
08/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 71 941 0618: I will
08/12/23, 9:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
08/12/23, 9:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Ammy/Saloni/8DEC2023*
08/12/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
08/12/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
08/12/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
08/12/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6.

11/12/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is fantastic, Ammy!
11/12/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/12/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
11/12/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
11/12/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
11/12/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

How are you?

May we begin with our session👏🏼
19/12/23, 9:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263719410618 @263772406169
19/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 941 0618: Good morning
19/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 941 0618: Yes me may
19/12/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know whom did you ask for the contact details?
19/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 941 0618: The students at the schools and I searched some of them they are not reachable
19/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 941 0618: I think it's because it's during the holiday
19/12/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if it is possible to physically visit them?
19/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 941 0618: Schools are closed
19/12/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: There are two ways to work on the African School Reform project:
19/12/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: A. *Connecting with school virtually*- 
▪️ In this you would have to find the contacts of the schools through your peers, friends, neighbors, cousins, school teachers, and school heads.
▪️Then introduce yourself to them professionally and state the purpose of connecting with them along with their available time.
▪️ Then share information about Edoofa that I will be providing you in order to help them understand the Program deeply and with more clarity.
▪️ Then share the school form with them, and if they are interested in connecting with us, then our aim should be to get the form filled.
19/12/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: B. *Visiting schools physically*
▪️ Now by this, as it clearly says, you have to visit schools nearby and inform them about Edoofa.
▪️ Visiting schools physically can have a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
▪️ With this, you will surely gain a lot of confidence, compelling skills, and leadership qualities, and yes, overcome the fear of presenting yourself and your family Edoofa, spontaneously in front of anyone at any point.
19/12/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 09:00-10:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
