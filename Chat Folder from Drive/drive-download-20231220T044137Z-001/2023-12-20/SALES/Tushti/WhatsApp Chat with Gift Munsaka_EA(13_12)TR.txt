18/12/23, 10:25 am - Tushti: What are your thoughts on India now?
18/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 477 8884: Its an amazing  wonderful place everyone wish to be
18/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 477 8884: Its a great pleasure to be their and acquire new skills that will help transforming the world into a better place
18/12/23, 10:36 am - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
18/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 477 8884: No
18/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 477 8884: The only scholarship we know that offers such chances to international students without scamming are from India
18/12/23, 10:46 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
18/12/23, 10:46 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 10:46 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 10:46 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 10:46 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 10:46 am - Tushti: In simple words Gift, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 477 8884: Oky oky l get it... Noted with thanks
18/12/23, 11:00 am - Tushti: Kindly ask the parent to come online and share their understanding of the cost of education in a voice note
18/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 78 477 8884: Oky oky noted

18/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 477 8884: Nop was calling her now she is at work
18/12/23, 12:46 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
18/12/23, 12:46 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
18/12/23, 12:46 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!
