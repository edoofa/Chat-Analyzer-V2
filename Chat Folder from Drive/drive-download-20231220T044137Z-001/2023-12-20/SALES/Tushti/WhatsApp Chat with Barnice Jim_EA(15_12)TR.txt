18/12/23, 3:37 pm - Tushti: Well, @263782505616 made it clear the family cannot afford the tuition fee
18/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 129 9452: Can you please explain the details of the tuition
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 129 9452: So that we can understand it's requirements
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: In simple words Barnice, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.* <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 129 9452: Okay umm we got it.
Thanks for your patience with us and  your explanation . Actually, as my guardian has explained earlier we cannot afford this fee of 2000 per year due to our financial status . Actually we don't wish to cancel the tuition if there's another way of applying it.
18/12/23, 3:57 pm - Tushti: We do have the EWYL Program through which you can self sponsor your education
18/12/23, 3:57 pm - Tushti: However, some contribution would have to be made by the family
18/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 129 9452: Sorry ma'am but if you can explain it, we'll be helped
18/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 129 9452: I'm doing this for my guardian to understand you better
18/12/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: Adding to your knowledge you see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/12/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. United College of Education, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected Sir Adam Luthuli has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
18/12/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
18/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 129 9452: Yeah it's true

18/12/23, 4:30 pm - Tushti: Noted
18/12/23, 4:31 pm - Tushti: So now, I have explained the cost if education already
18/12/23, 4:31 pm - Tushti: Would that be affordable for the family?
18/12/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 129 9452: Did I answer you right???
18/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 129 9452: To add more, I like playing volleyball game and doing music. I can say my family is my weakness and strength as well
18/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 250 5616: It's not affordable
19/12/23, 9:39 am - Tushti: In that case, does the family wish to cancel this application?
19/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 78 129 9452: No we don't wish to do so ma'am
19/12/23, 10:36 am - Tushti: May I know how the famiy would raise the required fee amount?
19/12/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 129 9452: Ma'am, umm, sorry 😔, maybe we're not telling you the truth. The thing here is like this ,we can not afford to pay for the tertiary education as it is too expensive for us. Thus ,we file this Edoofa scholarship so as to get help to go far with my education. If it pleass you I can send you my o-levels results which are very pleasing. I'm still doing great in my form 6 and the outcomes show that I can get 15 points at the final.


About your question ma'am, here in Zimbabwe it's very hard for a middle class family like ours to raise such amounts of 2000_ 3000 US dollars and still earn a living . Therefore, it's hard for a family like ours to raise the money for the tuition. So , I kindly beg of you if by any means I can get the scholarship and fulfill my childhood vision of being a lawyer.
