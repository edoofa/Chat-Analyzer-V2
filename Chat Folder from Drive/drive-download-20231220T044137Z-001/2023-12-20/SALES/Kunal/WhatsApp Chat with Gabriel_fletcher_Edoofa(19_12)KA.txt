*"Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going." - Sam Levenson*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
19/12/23, 10:01 am - +265 992 39 78 18: Yes I am ready sir
19/12/23, 10:01 am - +265 992 39 78 18: It's exactly 10:00
19/12/23, 10:01 am - +265 992 39 78 18: As you requested
19/12/23, 10:10 am - Kunal: It is a pleasure to connect with you
How are you?
19/12/23, 10:10 am - +265 992 39 78 18: I'm good and yourself sir
19/12/23, 10:11 am - +265 992 39 78 18: It is also a pleasure to connect with you too sir
19/12/23, 10:17 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
19/12/23, 10:17 am - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*


In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
19/12/23, 10:17 am - +265 992 39 78 18: Pleasure sir
19/12/23, 10:18 am - +265 992 39 78 18: Yes you can add them
19/12/23, 10:18 am - Kunal: May I know whom do you wish to add?
19/12/23, 10:18 am - +265 992 39 78 18: My mum
19/12/23, 10:19 am - Kunal: Shall we also add your father?
19/12/23, 10:19 am - +265 992 39 78 18: No just my mum
19/12/23, 10:20 am - +265 992 39 78 18: Should I add her or you will?
19/12/23, 10:25 am - Kunal: May I know why do you not wish to add your father?
19/12/23, 10:26 am - +265 992 39 78 18: Because he is a very busy man and won't be able to attend or see the messages but my mom is
19/12/23, 10:26 am - +265 992 39 78 18: And he's usually at work
19/12/23, 10:30 am - Kunal: Well
I would suggest that you can still add your father because they can go through our conversations once available and it would help them understand the different aspects of the program. It would be easier to explain to them and to address their thoughts
Is that fine?
19/12/23, 10:31 am - +265 992 39 78 18: Okay
19/12/23, 10:31 am - +265 992 39 78 18: So should I add them ?
19/12/23, 10:32 am - Kunal: So, I am making you the group admin. Please add them and let me know the names with which I should address them

19/12/23, 10:57 am - Kunal: May I know why your father left the group?
19/12/23, 10:58 am - +265 992 39 78 18: Like I said earlier he's a very busy person and my mom will update him on the discussions we have
19/12/23, 10:59 am - +265 992 39 78 18: So what time do we start the session ?

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 11:30 am - Kunal: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum.

Have you completed your IGCSE O level? <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 12:28 pm - +265 992 39 78 18: No I haven't sir
19/12/23, 12:31 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you, the IGSCE is equivalent to the 10th Standard or O level as per the UGC notification in India
Please note that you need to have IGCSE A level results in order to pursue a bachelor's degree and IGCSE O level results will make you eligible for a Diploma, not a Bachelor in India
19/12/23, 12:33 pm - +265 992 39 78 18: Oh I didn't know
19/12/23, 12:51 pm - +265 992 39 78 18: I want to get a bachelor's degree
19/12/23, 12:52 pm - +265 992 39 78 18: So what will happen now ?
19/12/23, 1:05 pm - Kunal: Unfortunately, if you are not going to proceed for IGCSE A level, you are only eligible for Diploma at university level
19/12/23, 1:05 pm - +265 992 39 78 18: I will proceed to IGcse a level
19/12/23, 4:08 pm - Kunal: I understand, Gabriel
Let me tell you that even after completing a Diploma you can get a lateral entry into a Bachelor's degree
19/12/23, 4:14 pm - +265 992 39 78 18: Could you explain how it works how long it will take to get the diploma and bachelor's degree in electrical engineering
19/12/23, 4:31 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand
After completing a Diploma of 3 years, you will be getting a lateral entry in the second year of a Bachelor's degree
19/12/23, 4:32 pm - +265 992 39 78 18: How long is both diploma and bachelor's degree
19/12/23, 4:51 pm - Kunal: The diploma program spans three years, and the bachelor's degree typically requires four years. However, with the provision of a lateral entry, the duration for completion would be condensed to three years.

19/12/23, 5:41 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
