     Iam a person whose optimistic,goal oriented and persistent at any interest of my work.I  do play football not taken as a career but a way of exercising my mental and physical body.looking at how people in the society live,many have conditions or heart related issues which hinders one to do or achieve work effectively.I was compelled to the matter and thought of persuing a course under Technology which happens to be cardiovascular Technology.
     Secondly, My highest level of education is O level/grade 12 ,I completed in 2018 at kafushi secondary school graduating with good results as a consequence of quality education offered there.
     Therefore,The course of study as stated in introduction I would like to persue is cardiovascular Technology,This course will not only help me as an individual but the globe at large, contributing to the industry under Technology through gathered information and research.
     However,my parents and myself are business oriented people.We have a poultry on which we depend on for our survival and I do sell electronic gadgets and apparel for my upkeep.
      Neverless,my father's current level edubcation is A level.He persued a course in Adult Education graduating with a degree but still not employed.                      My Mother's level of education is currently O level.
      My father and Mother have been sponsoring me since childhood untill date.They have supported me with everything they had untill my graduation to grade 12
   However,Out of 100% I rate only 20% can my parents afford concerning finances .At the look of our situation at home my parents cannot meet the requirements needed to cover up my finances.
      Further more, come from a family of 6 of which children we're 4 and I Am  the second born.two of my siblings are still doing there O level education and My elder brother just graduated from school with a diploma in clinical officing.
    Lastly I am currently not in any academic activities due to insufficient funds,that's more of a reason why I applied for Edoofa scholarship program.

18/12/23, 1:23 pm - +260 97 1819712: Kafushi secondary school is Located in central province of Zambia,in a town called kabwe.This boarding school stands on a motto which says,"decipline and hardwork lead to success" and that's so true to the fact that the school priortises every students to work hard to there ability.During my academic nurture,
I have witnessed the school producing Elite students graduating with flying colors and earning schorlaships at the end of there study.
      Nevertheless,the school has/had desciplined and dedicated teachers, working on extra hours in order to make the best out of students.
  Kafushi boarding, despite being in a rural area it provides the condusive studying environment and the Library for research work.
    

Kafushi secondary being a boarding school kept me bound on my academic work, with the provision of sufficient lessons and studying time did I find myself an opportunity to do my very best.
Kafushi secondary board encourages students to form study groups,of which I indulged  myself into.It has been understood that forming study groups contributes to the growth of one struggling with academic work.

The school activities that I indulged myself into where, the maths club,footall and singing in choir.
