11/12/23, 7:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 920 0295: Am sorry Gentlemen for not cooperating and actively participating
Our mobile networks here are not a favorable as u might think, so I think it best if yu would just send the questions randomly and me answering the same way

Thank you i hope for you to understand 🙏
11/12/23, 12:57 pm - Gurvinder: I understand your issue, Nyashadzashe.
11/12/23, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
11/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
11/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
11/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
11/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
11/12/23, 8:04 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
11/12/23, 8:42 pm - +263 71 920 0295: Oky Thank you Sir
I will be available during your working hours
12/12/23, 8:16 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
12/12/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 920 0295: Good morning how are you Sir

Okay,
Thank you
12/12/23, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: Please address this?
12/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 71 920 0295: Yeah that is very true
And sometimes we also become afraid that we won't make it in college because of lack of  finances
12/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Nyashadzashe, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 920 0295: Yes this is the only opportunity I have so I have to do what it takes
12/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 71 920 0295: And for Parents participation, I this you should add my Mother's number she is the one currently active online
12/12/23, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: Please send me her number so that I can add her to the group.

12/12/23, 5:45 pm - Gurvinder added +263 77 625 1042
12/12/23, 6:10 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

13/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Computer Application*
13/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 920 0295: Okay is it what they call it in India?
13/12/23, 5:00 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, it is correct.
13/12/23, 5:01 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
13/12/23, 5:01 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
13/12/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 920 0295: Yes it's true am confident
Just some positive hopes for these results ☺️
13/12/23, 5:43 pm - +263 71 920 0295: And how many points do they regard as a pass in A level in one subject
13/12/23, 7:11 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.

16/12/23, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
16/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 625 1042: My phone's network is not doing well
So I will answer that through my Mum's phone
16/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 625 1042: So the main reasons why I chose to apply for a scholarship abroad was that
- My interests and skills align more closely with the programs offered in India
- I believe that India has the available connections and resources that will help mee succeed 
Again, I don't think that my tertiary education will end well without a scholarship because of my family's financial status
16/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 625 1042: Am sorry for the inconveniences in our Mobile networks here 🙏

18/12/23, 7:22 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
