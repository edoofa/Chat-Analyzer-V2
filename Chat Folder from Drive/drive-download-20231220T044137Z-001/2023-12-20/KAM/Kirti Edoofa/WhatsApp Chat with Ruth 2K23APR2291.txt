06/09/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Ruth,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Ruth's higher education?

10/10/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Ruth.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to get in touch with you and express my understanding regarding the difficulties you've been facing recently, which have led to your absence.

Over the last few weeks, I've been anticipating your response and observed that you haven't been able to engage with us. May I know if you are facing any challenges @263719749119 @263775987016 @263785661672 ?
11/10/23, 5:33 am - +263 78 566 1672: Morning Ma'am. We are all well thank you. Please note that Ruth is starting her final exams this coming week and she has been under a lot of pressure. Am also engaged in my first half semester exams so can we do this later.
11/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well. Good morning! Thank you for the update. It's completely understandable that you both have academic commitments. Focus on your exams. However, please understand that we want you to connect because the 2024 admissions are now open only through Edoofa, and I do not want Ruth to miss this opportunity in such a case, what we can do is connect on Saturdays for 2 hours, where the work and study pressure is also less and you will be able to take out 2 hours easily. Does this plan sounds acceptable to you?
11/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied with some unforeseen work commitments, and I would love to answer your concern here however, as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 pm.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the academic documents it is duly noted with us may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
24/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
24/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good afternoon
Yes we are
24/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
24/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Step 5... The Admission Process. It sorely depends on the Earn While You Learn Program. To complete the application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare me for Statement of Purpose and then send it to their various Partner Universities.

Once you receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where my scholarship and fees would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, I  would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that i could start reducing my annual fee while I'll be in their country .
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
24/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 598 7016: No I don't
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
24/11/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. I would love to continue with our discussion, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
25/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, with regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to continue with our discussion ahead may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
26/11/23, 1:06 am - +263 77 598 7016: Good day to you Ma'am
I'm sorry for the late reply
I'm sure I'll be available during the day for the session
27/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth

I hope you're doing well and you had a great weekend since we were not available yesterday because of the weekend, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead with our discussion?
27/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good afternoon
Yes I'm available for the session
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 598 7016: I have read the benefits
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Ruth, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/11/23, 11:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, so l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good afternoon ma'am
28/11/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday?
28/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
28/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: may I know if you are clear so far?
28/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Not really
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
28/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
28/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 10, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
28/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes I've followed
I have no inquires
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
28/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Do provide more information
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
28/11/23, 10:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
29/11/23, 7:19 am - +263 77 598 7016: Good morning
Yes I understand
29/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/12/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth 

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
01/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes ma'am
01/12/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear so far?
01/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
01/12/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a student fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
01/12/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
01/12/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
01/12/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes I agree
01/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
01/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/12/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
01/12/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
01/12/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good night
02/12/23, 8:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ruth.

I hope this message finds you well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, since we were not able to continue with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion we will be available today till 12:30 pm only since it is Saturday today.
04/12/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth 

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
04/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good afternoon
Yes we are still in communication
04/12/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
04/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
04/12/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
04/12/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
04/12/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportun
04/12/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
04/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes I'm clear
04/12/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
04/12/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Hence this means I will be learning the skills through Edoofa and getting paid for it?
04/12/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct!
04/12/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/12/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 598 7016: No I don't
04/12/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
04/12/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
04/12/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
04/12/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Okay noted

15/12/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ruth,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/12/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/12/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good evening ma'am
I have read the offer letter
15/12/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/12/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/12/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 598 7016: My parents are a bit busy and they will get back to you as soon as they can concerning the payments
15/12/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
15/12/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that they can be busy, and I am sure they will be able to catch up with the discussion once they are available.
15/12/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/12/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/12/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 598 7016: 1. 1800 USD
2. 4 years
3. 300 USD
4. 750 USD
15/12/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response, however, may I know if you can update me with question 1 again since the question states, the tuition fee per semester after the scholarship?
15/12/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 598 7016: 900 USD after scholarship
15/12/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/12/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes it does
15/12/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/12/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/12/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/12/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am as it is Saturday our available hours will be from 08:30 am to 01:30 pm. I hope you will be available, have a great evening ahead.
15/12/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 598 7016: What do you think it's more safer and wiser?
15/12/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Staying in campus?
15/12/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Okay noted
Have a pleasant night
Thank you for the wonderful session
15/12/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, let me clear that query for you so that you are not left with two thoughts. Let me help you it is completely a student's choice to select the accommodation, however, all our students prefer to stay off-campus since it is cheaper compared to the on-campus and students have the freedom to cook for themselves as well and off-campus also includes the same number of facilities like the on-campus now I understand that being parents you can be concerned about the safety and security at off- campus.
15/12/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
15/12/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
15/12/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you want I can also help you connect with the students who are already staying off-campus because when you are in your home country it is natural for you to think that on-campus is better but over time students understand that it is the same and off-campus offers the same facility at a much cheaper price. In the end, the decision is yours if you do not wish to decide now you can even decide after you arrive in India. Because Galgotias University understands the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
15/12/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes it does
15/12/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Thank you
16/12/23, 9:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to my message yesterday. I wanted to reach out and check if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead and continue with our discussion and I can assist you in understanding the letter better?
16/12/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours for Saturday, let's reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great day and weekend, and looking forward to our conversation.
16/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good afternoon ma'am
16/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Okay noted
18/12/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Ruth,

I trust you are all doing well and had a productive weekend. Following up on our previous conversation, I'm reaching out to see if you are currently available to engage with us. This would allow us to proceed with our discussion as planned.
19/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good afternoon
19/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 598 7016: I'm available
19/12/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday, may I know why were you not able to connect with us yesterday at the scheduled time since you were informed about the discussion on Saturday?
19/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Electricity is a challenge
19/12/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that the electricity can be a challenge in that case, could you let me know a time by when you will be available to connect with us so that we can have a discussion?
19/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 598 7016: We can do it now if that's possible
19/12/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263775987016 I would love to continue with our discussion, however, I will now be heading for my dinner break now so if it is alright with you can be connect at 06:00 pm cat? <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Okay thats alright
19/12/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I look forward to connecting with you at 06:00 pm CAT today.
19/12/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I am now back from my dinner break and can continue with our discussion may I know if you are available to connect?
19/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good evening
Yes we can
19/12/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
19/12/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
19/12/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
19/12/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
It's clear
19/12/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
19/12/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
19/12/23, 6:10 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
We are together
19/12/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/12/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes please
19/12/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/12/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/12/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes we are
19/12/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/12/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/12/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes I stay in Harare
19/12/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/12/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/12/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/12/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Noted
19/12/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
19/12/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
19/12/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
19/12/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
19/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Noted
19/12/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
19/12/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Noted
19/12/23, 7:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
19/12/23, 7:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/12/23, 7:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
19/12/23, 7:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
19/12/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 598 7016: I have understood
19/12/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
19/12/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
19/12/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
19/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes it does
19/12/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
19/12/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/12/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 598 7016: I don't have any queries
19/12/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
19/12/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

19/12/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
19/12/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
19/12/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be tomorrow. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
19/12/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 598 7016: It does
19/12/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 598 7016: What time are we having the session
