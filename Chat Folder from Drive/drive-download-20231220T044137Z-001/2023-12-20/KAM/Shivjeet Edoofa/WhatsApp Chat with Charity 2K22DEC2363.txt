How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
18/10/23, 1:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
19/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
19/10/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure
19/10/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Noted
19/10/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
19/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Network here is a problem
19/10/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that network issues can be quite frustrating. Don't worry; we can proceed slowly, and you can reply whenever you have a stable connection. Please let me know the same.
19/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 259 7989: There are some registrations with some fee of which I have done all those
19/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Some of the steps I have forgotten siñce I am standing in the gape for the student
19/10/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
19/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
19/10/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.

You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
19/10/23, 7:16 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
19/10/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
19/10/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
19/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
19/10/23, 7:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
21/10/23, 12:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Charity!

I hope you are having a fine weekend. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unnoticed. With that being said, I will be available from 3:00 PM onwards this Monday to conduct our session, provide you with insights about the available opportunities, and address all your concerns.

Have a great weekend, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well. <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 259 7989: 👏
23/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Charity!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
23/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 259 7989: The weekend was ok
23/10/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In the mean time, if you are available shall we proceed with the session?
23/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
25/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
25/10/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/10/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
25/10/23, 3:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
25/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Ok
25/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
25/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/10/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Noted
25/10/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 7:00 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
25/10/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/10/23, 7:04 pm - +263 71 259 7989: More infor
25/10/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Noted
25/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 71 259 7989: So you mean the student shld aim 6 points above
25/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 259 7989: To qualify for a 50%
25/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct.
25/10/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now,  I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Can you clarify on benefit number 7
25/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 71 259 7989: What are you saying there
25/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one so that you will have a clear understanding of the same -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
25/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
25/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
25/10/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Ok now understood
25/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Charity!

I hope your day is off to a great start. It is alright. I am fully prepared to embark on your session, and I'd like to emphasize that I'll also be at your service in the evening at 7:30 PM. If you're ready to begin now, let's dive into the session and make the most of it.
26/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
26/10/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Charity's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Charity is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
26/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 259 7989: Yes
26/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Charity's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 71 259 7989: 👏
26/10/23, 10:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As I was going through the documents I have noticed that you are yet to share Charity's ID or Birth Certificate or passport. So as we are to proceed with the documents to be uploaded to the university please do share them early in the morning.
14/11/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Charity.
14/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

14/11/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Evening. How are you?

14/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay.
Sleep well.
15/11/23, 12:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Charity,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 12:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Greetings to you too
15/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 706 9627: I went through the letter but l have a few questions
15/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
16/11/23, 2:54 am - +263 78 706 9627: Okay am really looking forward to it
16/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Charity!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Afternoon to you too.
We are all good.
Hope you are also good
16/11/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that and yes I am good too, thank you for asking. Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay thank you
16/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 706 9627: 1. 900 USD
2. 3years 
3. 300USD
4. $ 750
16/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Yes l got it
16/11/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay so the amount of money is in USD or
16/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Apologize for late replies am connected with Ms Saloni on the other group and network is slow
16/11/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright and yes the amount is in USD. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Wow am amazed about this . I thought it was all compulsory . 
Now l understand
16/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 706 9627: That's clear
16/11/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/11/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 706 9627: We are together.
I will tell my parents if they can
16/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 706 9627: But isn't 28_ 12days
16/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's correct, and it is counted from the time you receive the offer letter from the university. I hope I've made that clear?
16/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 706 9627: I understand
16/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Sorry to bother but do you have the pictures of the University so l can just take a look
16/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, I will be doing that shortly as we proceed with the session. So, shall we now proceed with the session?
16/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Yes
16/11/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Yes please
16/11/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Yes
16/11/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 78 706 9627: No l stay in Plumtree , Matebeleland South
16/11/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Harare is like 400km from where l stay . Is that the only way
16/11/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No, it is not I am coming to that. If you happen to make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay ma'am this will be up to the parents only they are from work l will inform them but for better understanding you can send the details
16/11/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

16/11/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are referring to Mukuru of Mr. Shorwi?
16/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Yes

16/11/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Thank you
16/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay.. thank you. Have a great day as well
17/11/23, 1:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. I would like to let you know that I am now ready and active to take on your session for the admission process.

I would like you to give your full participation and concentration during these few hours that are required to complete and conclude our session for the day without any delay that may lead to the rescheduling of the session and the delay of this letter. So, if you are ready, please let me know so that we can proceed with this discussion.
17/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Good Afternoon to you. How are you
17/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. Shall we proceed with the session?
17/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Yes
17/11/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
17/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Yes am following
17/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
17/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
17/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
17/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Yes l got it
17/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 706 9627: So the money is paid how
17/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are referring to the registration fees?
17/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 706 9627: No l mean the total annual education cost
17/11/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for confirming that the amount can be paid by Charity once she is settled in the university. Alternatively, if you prefer to send the money to us earlier, that's also possible. By that time, we will provide you with multiple options so you can choose the best one according to your preference. Does that clarify things for you?
17/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Okay understood
17/11/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end. So, would you please let me know if we are still connected with this session so that we can conclude our session for the day?@263787069627
17/11/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 706 9627: Yes It's a good advantage to us
17/11/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/11/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 8:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Charity!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed, causing a delay in discussing the offer letter. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?
18/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 706 9627: Morning how are you?
The challenge we get is network it's always down so some messages don't reach me

Amidst the bustling days and nights, a pivotal document, the offer letter, stands as the gateway to this dream.

27/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Charity!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I would like to give you a gentle reminder that tomorrow marks the deadline for the first part of your university registration fees. The payment for this registration is crucial for you to secure your seat at this university and the others to come are also secured by this payment. As your admission officer, I do not want you to lose out on this opportunity.  With that in mind, could you please update me on your current preparations regarding the payment for the first part of the registration fees?

This information will be helpful for me to update the university officials. Once provided, they'll anticipate the arrival of your next payment accordingly.
28/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 706 9627: Man l know what time do our session start
28/11/23, 1:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and blessed. Please excuse my late arrival. I am now available to proceed with your session. Are you currently available to continue?
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As per our last conversation. We were reaching out to you to get an update on the discussion you had as a family regarding your scholarship offer letter from Galgotias University and your university admission formalities for the same. According to our records, you are supposed to make a payment of $300 towards your registration fee today, 28th November 2023.
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since today is the due date, as a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now?
28/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 259 7989: How are you our admission officer.I went through the offer letter but I could not come across the due date of paying the admission us300-00 only to see it today that the money is needed by today.We stay some 100km to get to where FBC bank is.
28/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 259 7989: From Mr Edmond Musina the father to charity Musina
29/11/23, 6:54 am - +263 71 259 7989: I am always out working in remote areas where network is a problem to see the sms
29/11/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and name. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

 I completely empathize with the challenges posed by the distance to the bank and the limitations caused by network issues in remote areas. Your commitment to your child's education is evident and commendable.

I regret the confusion regarding the deadline for the payment of the admission fee. As your admission officer, I have worked my best to extend your offer letter until the end of this month to make you retain this letter and secure your seat. Hence, I would like to give you good news that your university has extended the deadline until the end of this month, which is tomorrow, and after that, they will be closing the round of applications for this month. If you happen to miss this, I am afraid I won't be able to help you out and you would lose out on this opportunity. <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But for this, I would also need your help. Hence, could you please provide me with an update on the minimum amount that you were able to gather for your registration fees to meet the deadline for tomorrow and we can discuss the remaining amount next month?

Giving this update to the university officials will help me convince them to secure the seat for Charity so that she can be a part of her friends coming to India for their dream.
