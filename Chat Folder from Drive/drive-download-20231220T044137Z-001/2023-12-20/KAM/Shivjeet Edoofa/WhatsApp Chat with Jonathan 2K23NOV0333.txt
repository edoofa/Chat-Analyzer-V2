This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Mr. Shivjeet, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

22/11/23, 11:53 am - +265 999 49 36 36: Good day Mr Shivjeet
22/11/23, 11:54 am - +265 999 49 36 36: Well noted. We will make ourselves available and on time
22/11/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/11/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/11/23, 7:23 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Very well articulated
22/11/23, 7:24 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Well noted
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/11/23, 7:32 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Yes , following with keen interest
22/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/11/23, 7:43 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Very clear
22/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/11/23, 7:50 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Yes you can proceed
22/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understandIf you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?ing with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/11/23, 8:21 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Yes please

22/11/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
22/11/23, 9:15 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Hello Mr Shivjeet we are done listening to the videos. It's time to move to the next stage
22/11/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 5:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 9:16 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Thank you very much
23/11/23, 5:26 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: Hello sir how are you doing today
23/11/23, 5:27 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: We are very anxious about todays lesson can we proceed?!?
23/11/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 6:58 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: We are ready and waiting for you
23/11/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since you were done with the videos. May I know if you would be able to give me a brief understanding of the same?
23/11/23, 7:55 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: The main elements of the edoofa program are open mindedness following instructions. The edoofa program helps students to have affordable education for students of different countries as most of them cannot afford the fees in their respective countries. It also helps students of different cultures and background in cooperating with other. It is also a chance for students to advance in their careers and understanding. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/11/23, 8:52 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: Yes I am in agreement with this  analysis
23/11/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 2:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

27/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
27/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:30 PM.
27/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

27/11/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 8:33 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Very well noted sir, we will work on it and comply accordingly
27/11/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

28/11/23, 10:24 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: *Question 2*
Rights are privileges or entitlements that a person has granted by the law and must be respected by everyone including the state. That must be protected by the state for example you have a right to life therefore someone cannot come and take it away from you. While a duty is an obligation one has towards yourself and others that is not usually enforced by the law but if you fail to perform your duty someone can hold you accountable. For example, if somebody fails to report for work, the employer may ask you as to why you have to take your responsibility at your place
Human rights are basic rights that all people are entitled to regardless of their birth place, religion and many other aspects. Moving forward civil rights are rights that someone gets by belonging to a particular state of legal system that guarantee equal protection under the law e.g right to vote, right to fair trial and many more
28/11/23, 10:24 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: *Question 3*
A prosecutor is a person, especially a public officer or officially who institutes legal proceedings against someone. Prosecutors are fully entitled to bring any number of offences against a single defendant. While the attorney, is typically a lawyer for another business on legal matters in most cases he stands in as a defendant of an accused person in a court of law. For instance during a court proceeding the prosecutor will stand in to pin a person with incriminating questions to make sure that the court gives a verdict in favor of the law enforcement agency while the attorney or lawyer will always stand into defend the person whose being prosecuted by the state. In this regard the difference between an attorney and the prosecutor is they differ in their roles since they representing different angles. Further more their responsibilities differs in the sense that the prosecutor will always wants the person being prosecuted to be put in prison while the attorney will ensure that the accused is set free
28/11/23, 10:29 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: *Question 4* 
I am interested in corporate law. Firstly corporate law is a branch of civil law that deals with the formation, operations, and regulations of corporations. It covers things like the creation of corporations, their governance and management, mergers and acquisitions, securities regulation and the rights and responsibilities of shareholders. It's a complex and ever evolving area of law thats very important to the business world. It also covers some aspects of conducting corporate meetings and voting. Corporate law also deals with the legal liability of corporations and their officers, directors and shareholders. It is ever important to the business world and public. For example, when a big company looks to buy a smaller company, two companies want to join together, or an invester tries to put money into a starup, they'll look to corporate law to know how to legally conduct the transaction. People in corporate law carry out everything needed to complete these transactions, from legal researche to reviewing the final deal. I will take corporate law because it has captured my eye from quite a while back
28/11/23, 10:30 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: *Question 5*
 For me to be a successful lawyer I'm more than capable of making presentations as I've done during my secondary school time. I was able to make presentations during group gathering at school and during those activities I was the one who was speaking during our group gathering, are part from that I've taken part in some family activities when we had a wedding, during the weekend and I was tasked with the organization of the main event during that time we started by preparing decorations, food transport, sitting arrangement and accommodation for the invited guests. On food we had to prepare a list of food stuff such meat, rice, vegetables, drinks as well as water. After we went into sitting, we organized the table for the guest of honor, who was the bride and groom we also made reservations for the bridal party. We also set aside a table both parents of  the bride and groom families. But apart from that we had to arrange for chairs and tables for a total number of one hundred and fifty invited guests. In transport we had to arrange for the bridal party which included the bride and groom vehicle, the the bridal party's vehicle, the leading support couple and the camera men's vehicles after this organization I went back to chair man of the organizating committee to brief him on the preparedness of my team. In summary that was what my presentation to the chairperson of the organizing team. I also have reading skills
29/11/23, 6:11 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: Good evening sir how are you doing today we are currently waiting for the session today
29/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
29/11/23, 7:29 pm - +265 999 64 33 66: This is in order MrShivjeet.  Looking forward to hearing from you on Monday and have a great weekend
04/12/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

How are you doing this evening?
04/12/23, 6:37 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Good evening Mr Shivjeet
04/12/23, 6:38 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: We are all very well thanks for asking. How have you been the past few days
04/12/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with today’s session?
04/12/23, 6:54 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Yes please we are ready, let's proceed
04/12/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/12/23, 7:12 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: I happily confirm that this the course am taking BA LLB which is starting in August 2024
04/12/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
04/12/23, 7:40 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: Yes am ready to start
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/12/23, 8:29 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Yes you are very right Mr Shivjeet
04/12/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/12/23, 9:18 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Thank you very much for the efforts you take in accommodating us in your programs despite your busy schedule. We really appreciate everything that you are doing to our son to get a chance to study and accomplish his desire. Looking forward to tomorrow's session. Have a great night
05/12/23, 5:54 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: Good evening Mr Shivjeet. Hope you had a great day today. We are looking forward to hearing from you <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
05/12/23, 7:06 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: We are all ready to listen to what you have for us this evening
05/12/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
05/12/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
05/12/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
05/12/23, 7:42 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: This was indeed discussed with the counselor it's not strange to us
05/12/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to 1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
05/12/23, 8:38 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Yes , please proceed
05/12/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:


Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

06/12/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and my dear student!

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
06/12/23, 6:40 pm - +265 999 49 36 36: Good evening Mr Shivjeet. We appreciate you for updating us on the way forward. We thank you for all the effort you are taking in helping our student to get enrolled in one of your universities. We wish you a fruitful deliberation with the universities so that our student should be enrolled. Thank you so very much
14/12/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents, and Jonathan!

It has been a while now, and I am happy to let you know that I am back. Please, how are you doing today?
14/12/23, 6:17 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: Good evening 

Happy to have you back. We are all well and ready to hear from you
14/12/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are available for a quick session?
14/12/23, 6:33 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: Yes please. We are more than ready. We can proceed.
14/12/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with the previous example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350  as per the above example.
14/12/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $175 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
14/12/23, 6:41 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: This is well noted Mr Shivjeet.
14/12/23, 6:43 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: However, we are yet to receive the offer letter from the said university.
14/12/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/12/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
14/12/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/12/23, 7:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/12/23, 7:52 pm - +265 997 78 54 07: Of course we have reservation on the visa fee and air tickets. we were not told anything during we our consultation
14/12/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is great to know that we are clear. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/12/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
14/12/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
