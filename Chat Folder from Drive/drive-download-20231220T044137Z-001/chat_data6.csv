330 - 12 Dec 2023 09:42AM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school‚Äôs per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director. The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they: 1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
331 - 19 Dec 2023 09:04AM - +263 78 510 0890: GOD OF JUSTICE   A hard working and determined student, that's what Mufaro Marufu was. She completed her secondary education at Harare high school and tertiary education at University of Zimbabwe. She had studied Accounting and was lucky to get a job as soon as she finished her degree because jobs were very hard to find in Zimbabwe. Mufaro came from a middle class family of 6 children. Being the first child she was very hard working as she wanted to uplift her family. She started working in a town called Mutare as an accountant at House of Zeki, a company that used to pay her well. She could manage to pay school fees for for her 3 siblings and buy groceries for for her parents while they took care of other responsibilities. Mr and Mrs Marufu were very happy because their daughter had reduced their burden. While working at HOZ Mufaro fell in love with the CEO of the company. At first she refused to fall in love but ended up agreeing because the CEO was very charming, she fell for his sweet talks and besides he was very handsome that any girl would fall for him. The CEO's name was Michael Rwizi. Mufaro and Mr Rwizi started dating love was really on fire. They were the best couple that people admired. They used to wear matching clothes when going out for a date. After 2 years of dating Mufaro got pregnant. She informed Mr Rwizi but he denied it. ""You are too loose Mufaro. How could you agree to sleep with a man without knowing anything about his background?What type of a woman are you? I am a married man. My family lives in Harare and I have 2 children. I can never accept that thing you are carrying as my child. Get lost and never show me your face again.Do you here me?"" He said in a very fearce way.""How can you call our child a thing Michael? You are the father of my....... ""She did not finish talking and Michael interrupted her."" Enough of your nonsense. I told you l am a married man, just get lost okay. In fact you are fired don't come to work again. ""Immediately he wrote a fake report that Miss Marufu had stolen money from his cabin and got her out of the company without any hearing. Mufaro was very heartbroken, she was shattered in to pieces. Her soul was crushed especially when her character was questioned. She collected all her belongings and left HOZ in pain, tears and regret. ""Why did l do it? How will l live now? How am I going to raise this child on my own? What will l say to people? And my parents, what am I going to explain to them? Ooogh dear Lord, what have I done? What have I got myself into?"" She asked herself many questions as she was on her way back to Harare where here parents lived in a location called Budiriro. When she arrived her parents thought she was on leave. Everyone was happy to see her and they had supper together as a family. After supper everyone went to bed. Mrs Marufu followed Mufaro to her room. She sat on a chair which was beside the bed. ""My daughter, what's eating you up? I have been noticing you ever since you arrived, you don't look happy what's wrong?"" Mrs Marufu who used to know her daughter as a happy soul could notice that something was wrong. ""Nothing mom, l am fine. It's just that I'm tired. You know I'm always busy at work. I'm very exhausted mom let me freshen up."" She took her towel so that she could go and take a barth but before she even start walking her mother held her hand. ""l know you Mufaro. I'm your mother I can see when you are happy and when you are not. Don't lie to me, share with me whatever it is."" She said in a very calm tone, trying to figure out what was bothering her daughter. ""Mother l am a shame, I have dissapointed you, l am so...... ""She could not finish talking as she was already crying holding her mother."" No my child, you are not like that, why are you even saying such things? ""She was hugging Mufaro tightly calming her down. Mufaro finally gathered courage and told her mother everything. "" Ooogh my God! What have you done my daughter? What will I tell your father? Did you forget how much he struggled for you to complete your studies at university of Zimbabwe?Did you forget he had to sell tomatoes in Mbare for you? He tolerated all the sun burns for who? It was for you Mufaro, is this how you repay him? Heee! Answer me! Are you dumb? ""She was now fuming with anger. Mufaro had shattered her dreams."" Jesus Christ of Nazareth, what have l done to deserve this?""Mrs Marufu yelled loudly that her husband woke up. He went to Mufaro's room. ""What's happening Mufaro's mother? Why are you crying?"" he asked curiously. ""She is pr-e-g-na-nt, she is......""she didn't finish when Mr Marufu interrupted her."" What! Is this what you have been teaching your daughter while I was out there trying to make her life better? Heeegh! Answer me Mufaro's mother, look at the out come of your upbringing. Now l understand why long ago boys and girls were never treated as equals. Because girls are worthless, they don't deserve education, they are useless, to heck with modernity and the so called gender equlity. I hate you Mufaro l hate you. Leave my house now. I said now! ""Mufaro was now her mother's daughter because she had disgraced the family, but when she made the family proud she was Mr Marufu's pride and daughter. Mufaro left the house that night and went away. She was lucky enough to find a new job and started working again in Victoria Falls. She gave birth to a beautiful daughter and named her Anopaishe meaning God's gift. She raised Anopaishe alone as a single mother. Though she lived in a morden society, she faced a lot of troubles because of people who used to gossip about her. Some even called her daughter illegitimate, some used to call her characterlesss because she had a daughter out of wedlock. Society despite being morden still have some beliefs which noone can erase. However Mufaro managed to survive under such circumstances. She challenged societal beliefs that a child can not be raised without a father. She made herself a father and a mother to Anopaishe. She gave her the best education. She taught and natured her very well as she did not want Anopa to make the same mistake as hers. Anopaishe became a doctor after studying medicine in America for 7 years. After 7 years of education, Anopaishe came back home to Zimbabwe. She had found herself a boy who wanted to marry her whose name was Tinotenda Masuka. He came from a decent affluent family. His parents was happy with the allience and so was Mufaro Marufu. The two families fixed a date for the marriage. On the day of the marriage Mr Michael Rwizi showed up. It was now after 30 years. Mufaro almost fainted upon seeing him. ""What are you doing here? You told me not to show my face to you again, so why are you here? Get lost l don't want my daughter's marriage to be ruined because of you."" she shouted. ""How can you get my daughter married without her father?Who is going to negotiate the bride price if I'm not here?"" he said confidently with no shame. ""What! Which daughter are you talking about Mr Rwizi? Are you talking about the daughter you rejected 3 decades ago? Do you have any idea of how she grew up, how she suffered because of you? When other kids were playing with their fathers where were you? She was labeled illegitimate, she always asked me about her father but I could not tell her that you rejected us because you have a family. I gave her my last name and today you claim that she is yours, really? Where do you even get the guts? Don't you have any shame? Why are you so greedy? You are here for the bride price right? You want lobola of a child you rejected, how dare you? You want cattle because you found out that her fiance is rich right? It's not happening Michael Rwizi. No! Not under my watch. I failed to fight for myself but today l will fight for my daughter and protect her from a shameless man like you. Get out of my house now. ""she said looking into Michael 's eyes. He was very shocked to see that side of Mufaro."" I am not greedy, but according to our Zimbabwean culture, it is the father who negotiate the bride price and the amount of cattle he wants to give his daughter for marriage, he takes the large amount of money. You know that this is my right and no one else. It's my right as a father not yours. Don't try to take away my rights. I will go nowhere because Anopaishe is my daughter and I am going to negotiate her lobola price. ""he said with confidence and arrogance."" Excuse me, l am sorry l don't know you but l heard you claiming to be my father. I am sorry for what I'm about to say but you can never be my dad and l will never call you father, for it is a shame to have a father like you and a disgrace to the name FATHER. I don't need you in my life. I only know my mother, and she is my father as well With all due respect Mr Rwizi get lost before l call the security. ""Anopaishe said in anger. Mr Rwizi did not leave. Security! Throw him out."" Mr Rwizi was thrown out of Mufaro's house and got a taste of his own medicine.
332 - 19 Dec 2023 12:43PM - Aditi Edoofa: Wow, what a powerful and gripping story of resilience, strength, and the enduring bond between a mother and daughter! Mufaro's journey is a testament to the indomitable spirit that can rise above societal judgments and challenges.  Mufaro faced adversity with courage, turning her life around despite the hardships. Anopaishe, her daughter, exemplifies the strength inherited from her mother and the ability to define her own worth. The confrontation with Mr. Rwizi adds a dramatic twist, showcasing the triumph of integrity over greed and societal norms.  Your storytelling is truly captivating, weaving a narrative that resonates with themes of love, sacrifice, and the pursuit of one's identity. It's a tale that reflects the complexities of life and the triumph of the human spirit. üëèüíñ",No,No

145 - 19 Dec 2023 04:00PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kelvin, I am sharing today's session reading material with you!
146 - 19 Dec 2023 04:01PM - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about, 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled 2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
147 - 19 Dec 2023 04:01PM - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe‚è´  Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*üí•  Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course. *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached* Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5‚ÄôS of Edoofa. Best of Luck!

Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days. *Sounds interesting, right?*

A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

Known for her exceptional skills in crafting intricate jewellery, Tarumbidzwa's creations were highly sought after. One day, a mysterious stranger approached her with an offer to mass-produce her designs and make a fortune.  Tarumbidzwa , guided by her unwavering integrity, declined the tempting proposal. Instead, she chose to continue her diligent work, putting her heart and soul into each piece. Word of her commitment to quality and authenticity spread, attracting customers who valued the true artistry behind her jewellery.  As time passed, Tarumbidzwa 's small shop flourished, and she became a respected figure in Jalandhar . Her success was not only a testament to her artistic talent but also to the enduring virtues of integrity and diligence.

However, I had a plan for our session, which I am stating now.  With years of experience, I want you to accumulate some credits before you come here to India. Students who have already earned some credits are living much better lives as they can help their parents with travel costs and even semester fees. I am sure you have also signed up for EWYL, so that you can do the same. As your mentor, I want to ensure that you utilize our services and earn for yourself. Now, have some faith in me and start working.  As a starting point, I have a small target for you for the day! Connect with at least *2 students* today under your community building project and submit the application forms to me by tomorrow. By tomorrow, you will either be successful with the two students or may face some challenges, on which we will work together!  All the best!

So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they: 1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

217 - 19 Dec 2023 08:36AM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.* You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5‚ÄôS which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa. Best of Luck!

317 - 16 Dec 2023 10:44PM - +91 84272 64623: Once upon a time there was a girl named Amina who was living abroad. Amina was born and raised in a vibrant village in Malawi, where she grew up surrounded by the rich culture and traditions of her community.  As Amina got older, she developed a deep curiosity about the world beyond her village. She dreamt of exploring new places, meeting people from different backgrounds, and experiencing diverse cultures. With determination in her heart, Amina set off on a journey to study abroad in London.  Arriving in the bustling city, Amina felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. Everything seemed so different from what she was used to - the towering buildings, the fast-paced lifestyle, and the diverse mix of people from all around the world.  But Amina embraced the challenges and embraced her new home. She quickly made friends from various countries, each with their own unique stories and experiences. They would gather to share their favorite dishes, dance to African beats, and teach each other about their respective cultures.  Amina's time in London was filled with incredible opportunities for growth and learning. She pursued her passion for art and discovered a love for photography, capturing the beauty of the city through her lens. She also became an advocate for cultural exchange, organizing events that celebrated the richness of African heritage.  Even though Amina was far from her homeland, she never forgot her roots. She proudly shared her African traditions with her friends, introducing them to vibrant festivals, traditional clothing, and the warmth of her community back home.  Through her experiences, Amina realized that home is not just a physical place but a feeling of belonging and connection. She carried the spirit of Africa with her wherever she went, spreading joy, understanding, and celebrating the beauty of diversity.  And so, Amina's journey abroad became a beautiful chapter in her life, allowing her to bridge cultures, make lifelong friendships, and inspire others with her vibrant spirit.  The end.

258 - 19 Dec 2023 02:48PM - +263 77 314 5357: Greetings Ms Sharda. I am Chido's father, but am very far away from her as I am involved in Zimsec marking in Mutare. The line that feeds electricity to St Kilian's developed faults so people have challenges in charging their phones, Chido included. I am also failing to get in touch with the family for the reason highlighted. That is one of the major challenges facing most rural communities in Zimbabwe, in addition to the unstable mobile network. As soon as she becomes available she will get in touch with you. <This message was edited>
259 - 19 Dec 2023 03:47PM - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day dear parent!  I hope this message finds you well amidst your commitments in Mutare. I appreciate you taking the time to share the current challenges faced by Chido and her community. It's indeed disheartening to hear about the electricity and mobile network instability affecting daily life, especially during such crucial times.  Rest assured, I understand the difficulties Chido is facing and the importance of staying connected, particularly during the examination period. I appreciate your efforts in keeping me informed. Please convey my best wishes to Chido and assure her that whenever she's ready, I'm here to provide any support or guidance she may need.  In the meantime, I hope the situation with the electricity and mobile network stabilizes soon for the well-being of the community.

289 - 16 Dec 2023 09:12AM - +263 78 511 0068: Saturday Activity   There was a boy named Thomas who is really good at sports, but he struggles in school. He was to decide whether to cheat on his tests to get good grades , or accept that he might not be the best at everything.  Thomas was always the fastest runner on his school's track team. He loved the feeling of winning races and getting applause from the crowd. But when it came to school work he didn't do as well. His grades were low , and he had trouble paying attention in class. One day, Thomas's teacher offered him a deal. She said she would give him better grades if he helped her with some of the work.  If Thomas accepts the deal, he could get better grades. But if he helped his teacher cheat he is not really earning his grades. He would be sacrificing his integrity.  Thomas went to his teacher and told her that he couldn't help her cheat.He said he believed that everyone should earn their grades honestly. At first, his teacher was angry and some of his classmates were upset too. But over time, his teacher realized that Thomas was right. She stopped giving students special treatment and started grading them fairly. And some of his classmates started working harder in school, just like Thomas had.  In the end , Thomas was glad he had made the right decision even though it had been difficult. He felt like he had learned an important lesson.  Sometimes doing the right thing is hard. But it's always worth it.   Providence

Kindly understand that there is a scheduled time for our sessions and it is importnat to be available for the session at the scheduled time which is from *1:30pm to 2:30pm* These sessions are crucial because students learn important skills like persuasion and communication. They also get the opportunity to work on projects and earn scholarship credits, which can be quite significant.  I've noticed that *Tanaka* has been missing sessions, and compared to other students, he's falling behind. Some of his peers have already earned $600-$700 in scholarship credits by being regular attendees.  I would like to understand any challenges *Tanaka* might be facing, and I'm ready to resume his sessions starting tomorrow. Your prompt response would be appreciated.

154 - 19 Dec 2023 02:12PM - +263 71 562 2820: GLP is a system assurance that labs use to ensure integrity,consistency and reproductibility within non clinical studies and tests.GLP stands for GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE.GLP regulations are not concerned with the technical or scientific ,content of research but they are rather concerned with the quality assurance.In GLP there are rules which should be followed by the experimenters .There is a rule which states that every test should be conducted using protocols and written standard operating procedures to ensure that the results are repeatable .In GLP equipments should be in correct working order  following a correct  program of qualifications , maintenance and calibration.GLP covers equipment including suitability for a study. GLP is followed so that correct equipments can be used at their correct intervals .GLP also affects scales and balances and they should be calibrated for use in studies with frequency  of calibrations defined as part of  regular operation procedures mentioned earlier by the calibrators. Documentation of calibration and other types of equipments tested have to be retained too.GLPis well considered so that after experiments,raw data has to reflect the procedures and conditions of study  while the final report which is usually provided to authorities must include an account of the way the analysis was performed with scientific interpretation of data.
155 - 19 Dec 2023 02:37PM - +263 71 562 2820: Sterilisation methods used in laboratories are 1)Dry heat 2)Autoclaving 3)Filtration 4)Radiation 5)Solvents 6)Flash sterilisation I can explain Autoclaving Autoclaving is the most used method of sterilisation in many laboratories.There is the  use of an  autoclave .

A prosecutor is a lawyer who works for a state or government organisation and is responsible for starting legal proceedings and then proving in court that the suspect committed crime he's accused of. Prosecutors are responsible for gathering evidence ,prosecuting cases and present then to a court.The prosecutors job is to see that all the relevant facts including those favourable to an accussed are placed before the court and to present those facts in an ethical, fair dispassionate , firm and clear manner.Whereas an Attorney is an individual who is legally empowered to act on someone else's behalf. They do not require any legal qualifications for instance an older relative can ask someone to be an attorney and act on their behalf ,even if you're not a lawyer  A prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubts, while the attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the clients innocense.

178 - 19 Dec 2023 01:56PM - +263 77 756 4664: Thank you
194 - 19 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
195 - 19 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
196 - 19 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
197 - 19 Dec 2023 02:31PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
198 - 19 Dec 2023 02:34PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes l understand noted and following
199 - 19 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
200 - 19 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
201 - 19 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
202 - 19 Dec 2023 04:47PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes very well
203 - 19 Dec 2023 06:40PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?

205 - 19 Dec 2023 06:49PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:  Tuition Fee: $350 per annum Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship) Miscellaneous Fee: $1000 Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)  Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
206 - 19 Dec 2023 06:49PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes very well
207 - 19 Dec 2023 06:51PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year‚Äôs fee, which is $2800 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
208 - 19 Dec 2023 06:51PM - +263 77 756 4664: Okay noted
209 - 19 Dec 2023 06:52PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
210 - 19 Dec 2023 06:52PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
211 - 19 Dec 2023 06:52PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

213 - 19 Dec 2023 07:15PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.  Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
214 - 19 Dec 2023 07:16PM - +263 77 756 4664: I don't have any queries now
215 - 19 Dec 2023 07:36PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, now for our discussion let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm, so that we can discuss the step 4 of the admission cycle in detail.

505 - 19 Dec 2023 01:41PM - +260 97 7632700: Clear thanks
506 - 19 Dec 2023 01:47PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, which you have already paid, and the $1000 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee that is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter.  I hope you are clear now?
507 - 19 Dec 2023 01:49PM - +260 97 7632700: In short they are treated differently
508 - 19 Dec 2023 01:50PM - +260 97 7632700: Not to subtracted from the tuition fees
509 - 19 Dec 2023 02:09PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, the $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
510 - 19 Dec 2023 02:10PM - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Joyce is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education.  Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
511 - 19 Dec 2023 02:10PM - +260 97 7632700: Okay
512 - 19 Dec 2023 02:10PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
513 - 19 Dec 2023 02:10PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
520 - 19 Dec 2023 02:26PM - +260 97 7632700: Yes please will appreciate
521 - 19 Dec 2023 02:27PM - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:  1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).  2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *January 29th, 2024, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
522 - 19 Dec 2023 02:27PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Joyce's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023*.  I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
523 - 19 Dec 2023 02:32PM - +260 97 7632700: Yes clear,
524 - 19 Dec 2023 02:33PM - +260 97 7632700: Will the university email me Joyce's offer letter or this same one you sent <This message was edited>
525 - 19 Dec 2023 03:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand what you are trying to say here. However, let me help you understand better. The university is our partnered university and sometimes the university gets occupied hence they share the offer letter with us to share with you, meaning the letter you have received is the official offer letter. So you do not have to worry about it.
526 - 19 Dec 2023 03:41PM - +260 97 7632700: Okay
527 - 19 Dec 2023 03:46PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -  The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account
528 - 19 Dec 2023 03:46PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send.  May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?

197 - 19 Dec 2023 07:12PM - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.  If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
198 - 19 Dec 2023 07:13PM - +263 77 440 5506: Yes its clear
199 - 19 Dec 2023 07:14PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
200 - 19 Dec 2023 07:17PM - +263 77 440 5506: May I know the letter says it must be paid within 30 days and you are saying its 15 days  im a little  lost
201 - 19 Dec 2023 07:34PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
202 - 19 Dec 2023 07:37PM - +263 77 440 5506: May it can help i might behave missed it thank you
203 - 19 Dec 2023 07:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:  1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 31, 2023,* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).  2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 31, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
204 - 19 Dec 2023 07:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 31st, 2023.  I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?

88 - 19 Dec 2023 07:52PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
89 - 19 Dec 2023 07:52PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.
90 - 19 Dec 2023 07:54PM - +263 78 312 4048: Ok yes these two are clear
91 - 19 Dec 2023 08:07PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-  *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
92 - 19 Dec 2023 08:07PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa‚Äôs recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.  I hope you are following?
90 - 19 Dec 2023 07:54PM - +263 78 312 4048: Ok yes these two are clear

I hope you are following?
93 - 19 Dec 2023 08:10PM - +263 78 312 4048: Yes I am following
94 - 19 Dec 2023 08:12PM - +263 78 312 4048: So about the offer letter let's say maybe two universities accepted my request do I get a chance to choose were to go or edoofa does the chosing
95 - 19 Dec 2023 08:49PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You have the option to choose the university and we will guide you on your preference.
96 - 19 Dec 2023 08:50PM - +263 78 312 4048: Ok it's well understood
97 - 19 Dec 2023 08:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -  *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
98 - 19 Dec 2023 08:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.  I hope these are clear as well?  Ensure you check the amount of the registration fee

175 - 19 Dec 2023 08:07PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
176 - 19 Dec 2023 08:08PM - +263 77 293 4976: Correct
177 - 19 Dec 2023 08:08PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
178 - 19 Dec 2023 08:09PM - +263 77 293 4976: Please explain
179 - 19 Dec 2023 08:25PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay. <This message was edited>
180 - 19 Dec 2023 08:25PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months.  That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
181 - 19 Dec 2023 08:26PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
182 - 19 Dec 2023 08:29PM - +263 71 855 2335: Yes
183 - 19 Dec 2023 08:42PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.",No,Yes

190 - 19 Dec 2023 07:58PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment -  The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
191 - 19 Dec 2023 07:59PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?

193 - 19 Dec 2023 08:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
194 - 19 Dec 2023 08:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment.

149 - 16 Dec 2023 08:27PM - +263 77 140 5373: *Using a pumping loop to mix miscible fluids in a tank the contents are considered well mixed when:*  Firstly to understand a pumping loop, it is a system that circulates fluids in a closed loop to mix them. Once the fluids have been mixed in the tank the general rule to consider a well mixture is to turn the tank over three times and then sample the tank for mixture properties. By turning the tank over, you actually force the entire volume of the tank through the pump at least three times. Some more turnovers may also be necessary in some instances.
150 - 16 Dec 2023 08:27PM - +263 77 140 5373: *General rules for flushing  slurry lines*  A slurry line is a specially engineered pipeline used to move ores such as coal/iron or mining waste over long distances. A mixture of the ore concentrate and water called slurry is pumped to its destination and water filtered out.  Some of the general rules:  Slurry lines should be flushed with a minimum fluid velocity of 10 ft/s and the total flushing liquid volume should be equal to three to six times the total piping volume. The pump should also not be rotating and the liquid in the pump should be stationery, not flowing in or out of the pump prior to starting the flush procedure. If there is a closed discharge valve in the system the vent valve between the pump and the discharge valve must be open.

It is an efficient means of handling and transferring various types of bulk granular and powdered products with minimal loss and lower cost than n other systems  *There are 2 main types:* Lean phase and dense phase  *Lean phase*- is commonly used and is used for granules and powders. There are 2 categories under Lean phase : 1) Dilute phase - it is for conveying non-abrasive materials with low bulk density e.g flour It has a gas velocity greater than  17 ms‚Äê¬π with lower vacuum  2) Medium phase - particles travelling through pipeline remain suspended throughout with a low concentration or solids loading ratio.  *Dense phase* - is ideal for moving sensitive and fragile products. Products travel at lower velocities and some common applications include abrasives such as sugar and blended products.

158 - 19 Dec 2023 07:57PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
159 - 19 Dec 2023 07:57PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes.

132 - 15 Dec 2023 04:31PM - +263 77 623 2165: (2. Elaborate on the difference between rights and duties and give a further explanation of the difference in Human rights and Civil rights   Rights, a right is a power or claim possessed by an individual to do something for example children have the right to education whilst Duty is an obligation to do or omit to do something for example Parents is their duty to fulfill their needs and wants. Moreover, right is an interest recognized and protected by the state whereas Duty is an obligation created and imposed by the state. Also, every legal right has a corresponding duty whilst every legal duty has not a corresponding right. In addition, a person whose right is violated can go to court for remedy whilst a person who has not full filled his duty is subjected to punishment. Furthermore, a person is free to not exercise his rights whilst a person is not free to not fulfill his duties. Rights help to control others action as per own wish whilst Duty impose obligations to act as per other's will. Human rights are rights one acquires by being alive whilst Civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state. Human rights include, the right to life and the right to education. Civil rights include protection from discrimination.   (3. The difference between a prosecutor and an attorney.   Prosecutor, government official charged with bringing defendants in criminal cases to justice in the name of the state. Prosecutors are in charge of all phases of a criminal proceeding from the investigation by the police through the trial and beyond to all levels of appeal. Many also defend the state in civil actions. In the United kingdom, prosecution is carried out in the name of the crown. In this sense the crown can be said to prosecute and the prosecution is often referred to as ""the crown"",whereas an attorney they provide professional advice, prepare documents, and appear in court to plead on behalf of their clients on litigation involving them and research all case elements , including official documentation in including a police report. They pay close attention to the legal system elements that pertain to the client's case and search for relevant, previously filed pleadings. Attorneys formulate strategy on behalf of clients intending to find timely and look effective ways to manage legal issues. Rather than take a case to trial, attorneys attempt to resolve it promptly. Attorneys familiarize themselves with a client's case.   (4. Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Corporate or Criminal, and why?   Criminal law, the body of law that defines criminal offenses, regulates the apprehension, charging and trial of suspected person and fixes penalties and modes of treatment applicable to convicted offenders. This branch am interested in pursuing it because there are some cases whereby one is charged for a crime that they did not commit and spend their rest of their lives in prison so I took it upon myself to be more interested in the criminal branch so that I can prove their Innocence and provide justice. The criminal branch is the only one of the devices by which organized societies protect the security of individual interests and ensure the survival of the group. There are in addition the standards of conduct instilled bt family , school, and religion, the rules of the office and factory. The branch serves the purpose of criminal law which prevent crime with the development of the social sciences there arose new concepts, such as those of the protection of the public and the reform of the offender. Am more interested in the important differences exist between the criminal law of most , English speaking countries.   (5. What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer   Firstly, there is good verbal communication, a lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding. Secondly, I have good time management I have the art of delegation tasks, working within, deadlines, and prioritizing tasks, to achieve success is very essential. Moreover, self-confidence. I have the ability to have a strong belief in myself which will go a long way in winning arguments and cases. Furthermore, Patience is an attribute of my skill. I have the ability to deal with different types of people and some cases , and procedures stretch over a period of time which my patience is needed and careful handling. Lastly team work skills, since the field am going to learn will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective there is need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information with people helps in attaining the objectives

140 - 19 Dec 2023 07:49PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
141 - 19 Dec 2023 07:49PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes.

This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

148 - 19 Dec 2023 08:10PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.  Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Chemistry) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
149 - 19 Dec 2023 08:12PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir the information states above is correct and accurate
150 - 19 Dec 2023 08:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
151 - 19 Dec 2023 08:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
152 - 19 Dec 2023 08:45PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
153 - 19 Dec 2023 08:46PM - +263 77 734 4102: Yes sir
154 - 19 Dec 2023 08:47PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:  *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.  *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.  *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.  *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.",No,Yes

71 - 19 Dec 2023 07:56PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process.

73 - 19 Dec 2023 07:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.

77 - 19 Dec 2023 07:56PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa‚Äôs recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.  I hope you are following?
78 - 19 Dec 2023 07:58PM - +263 78 126 2807: I understand very well
79 - 19 Dec 2023 08:24PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -  *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
80 - 19 Dec 2023 08:24PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.  I hope these are clear as well?
81 - 19 Dec 2023 08:43PM - +263 78 126 2807: That is very clear as well
82 - 19 Dec 2023 08:44PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder‚Äôs office*?

107 - 18 Dec 2023 02:45PM - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn‚Äôt have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent. *Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student‚Äôs first year‚Äôs annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*

(The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
128 - 19 Dec 2023 12:08PM - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

280 - 19 Dec 2023 09:37PM - Austin: Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program.  *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. This cost can be further reduced by Lenos through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program  *Enrollment fee* For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While You Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
281 - 19 Dec 2023 09:38PM - Austin: *Registration Fee* The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter.  *The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*  For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600  The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family
282 - 19 Dec 2023 09:47PM - +263 77 903 3457: Ok, understood. Now the other question is, is there room for the child to pursue his aeronautical career of interest
283 - 19 Dec 2023 09:47PM - Austin: Yes please, the child needs to have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in A level to pursue the course
284 - 19 Dec 2023 09:48PM - Austin: We offer Aerospace Engineering
292 - 19 Dec 2023 09:56PM - Austin: Also, be careful if any University offers the course with the current combination, because the degree won't be approved as per the AICTE norms and won't be valued.
293 - 19 Dec 2023 09:58PM - +263 77 903 3457: Yaaahh it's a tricky situation then
294 - 19 Dec 2023 10:00PM - Austin: I can understand and I will help you with another insight to the aspiration of Lenos!
295 - 19 Dec 2023 10:01PM - Austin: Here are some ways in which a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering could be beneficial in the aeronautical field:  Software Development: Aeronautical engineering involves a significant amount of software development for designing, simulating, and testing aircraft components. Knowledge of programming languages, algorithms, and software development methodologies can be valuable in creating and maintaining the software used in aeronautical applications.  Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Aeronautical engineers often deal with large datasets for simulations, testing, and performance analysis. A background in computer science can be useful for applying data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful insights from these datasets.  Control Systems and Automation: Computer science skills can be applied in the development of control systems and automation in aircraft. This includes programming and implementing algorithms for autopilot systems, navigation, and other automated processes.  Cybersecurity: As aircraft systems become more connected and reliant on digital technologies, the importance of cybersecurity in the aeronautical field increases. Knowledge of computer security and network protocols can be crucial in protecting critical systems from cyber threats.  Simulation and Modeling: Computer simulations play a vital role in aeronautical engineering for testing designs and predicting the performance of aircraft. CSE graduates can contribute to the development and improvement of simulation software used in the aeronautical industry.  While a B.Tech in CSE provides a strong foundation in computer science, individuals interested in working in the aeronautical field may benefit from gaining additional knowledge in aeronautical or aerospace engineering through certifications, specialized courses, or even pursuing a master's degree in aerospace engineering. This interdisciplinary approach can enhance your capabilities and make you more competitive in the aeronautical job market. It's also essential to stay updated on industry trends and technologies to bridge the gap between computer science and aeronautical engineering.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15 - 19 Dec 2023 12:32PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16 - 19 Dec 2023 12:32PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17 - 19 Dec 2023 12:32PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?

18 - 19 Dec 2023 12:34PM - +263 71 671 8643: Okay nice to know
19 - 19 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Allan, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20 - 19 Dec 2023 08:47PM - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*.  Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

89 - 19 Dec 2023 12:35PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Birthwell, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn‚Äôt it?
92 - 19 Dec 2023 01:21PM - +263 73 815 1871: Yes that's it
93 - 19 Dec 2023 01:53PM - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa‚Äôs vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India‚Äôs Independence.  *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*  1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.  2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.  3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.  4. *Faculty Expertise:* Skilled faculty bring real-world expertise to the classroom, guiding your academic journey.  5. *Global Recognition and Careers:* Indian degrees open doors worldwide, paving the way for global success.  6. *Cultural Diversity and Campus Life:* Experience a vibrant campus life with cultural festivals and a rich heritage.  7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* India offers quality education at a lower cost and provides scholarships to support you.  8. *English Medium of Instruction:* Most courses are taught in English, ensuring a smooth learning experience.  9. *Research and Innovation:* Engage in cutting-edge research, fostering critical thinking and creativity.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!",No,No

245 - 18 Dec 2023 08:26PM - +260 97 5232462: Sorry we had a small challenge. However the answers to the questions above are: 1. Bachelor of business administration. 2. India 3. 6000-8000 USD 4. About K3000 and which may reduce through the earn while you work program. 5. K350  and it should be paid within 7 days . 6. The earn while you work is an initiative aimed at lessening the hardship that students go through while learning. This is described as the backbone of Edoofa and students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain experience, at the same time earn money. This is in form of scholarship credits which are based on students involvement. This is equivalent to physical cash. The credit gained can be used to pay off part of the students fees. In this program students learn 21 st century job skills. By engaging in this program not only will a student be ready as a professionals but make life easier in terms of achieving their ambitions by reducing the cost of higher education. 7. Yes

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.

B SECTION 5 The Rwanda story is one of the hate, despair and resillience in building a nation . It is very clear that we do not only need to learn from history, but we need to make faster links between the past and the present. History should be transformed into lessons for humanity that are relevant to today's societies. The history of Rwanda and the inspiring and haunting stories of individually communities and governments during the genocide, the example can teach us much about moral choices and their consequences . The price of mass atrocities and genocide is always very high. After the genocide ended in juli 1994 , Rwanda was a devastated country it's basic infrastructure was destroyed, millions of people were diplaced and many surviving tsutsi's had lost their families. Rape and sexual violence was common among many women. Thousands of children were orphaned and had to fend themselves. Countless of survivors developed long term phycological problems. However Rwandese people have shown their resillience and embarked on building their nation . Today Rwanda remains one of the most developed nations in Africa. There has been robust infrastructure development. Development has also seen in areas of education and healthy. Good leadership has been at the centre of this success. SECTION 6 MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY I have always looked to my brother inspiration. I have two brothers and am the only girl, I came in between two the brothers. My brothers are intelligent and self motivated and like studying, you don't need to push them to study. By the way my elder brother is a third year engineering student at the University of Zambia. He is born mathematician and was always top his class, on the other hand I need great inspiration to study and hence I thought of myself as second best. However during my grade nine examinations I studied so hard that I surpassed my elder brother. I could not believe myself for this milestone achievement. From now onward I look at myself differently. I can do all things as long as I have the desire to do so. All things are possible to any one who believes. Thank you.

33 - 19 Dec 2023 12:54PM - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
34 - 19 Dec 2023 12:55PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
35 - 19 Dec 2023 12:55PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
36 - 19 Dec 2023 12:55PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
37 - 19 Dec 2023 12:55PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
39 - 19 Dec 2023 01:07PM - +263 71 597 4800: I do not wish to reduce the burden but to eliminate it from my mother's mind  and a lot of other people who , from since I graduated high school, have been asking me what I do I really want that seems to be not working at all, some have already begun encouraging that I find a job and start helping my mother and brother to continue his education whilst I'm working and probably get an on the job training which has also proven difficult in that qualified individuals are also looking for those opportunities, so the competition is stiff
40 - 19 Dec 2023 01:11PM - +263 71 597 4800: So I wanted to sharpen my skills and make myself a competent individual who can be helpful to give back to at least my community, and then my country, probably make it up to the world, just to give back more than I consume , what some call a positive net contribution to the world , in short just to be helpful
41 - 19 Dec 2023 01:23PM - Gurvinder: Noted.
42 - 19 Dec 2023 01:23PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Christopher, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
43 - 19 Dec 2023 01:27PM - +263 71 597 4800: Yes , number 1, I do not know if the other days count though, but my mom cannot be with me
44 - 19 Dec 2023 01:56PM - Gurvinder: May I know the reason why?
45 - 19 Dec 2023 01:58PM - +263 71 597 4800: My mom doesn't have a phone that can go on WhatsApp, and she's is in Bulawayo, I'm in Harare , maybe she can because her friend is on WhatsApp and if we ask her to let my mom join on her phone , I do not know if that works for you
46 - 19 Dec 2023 02:00PM - +263 71 597 4800: And also , like I said I will be at Madokero where my mom's aunt stays , she said I can use her wifi for this counseling session so maybe I can ask her to join too
47 - 19 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Gurvinder: Yes please, you can ask your aunt to join.
48 - 19 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Gurvinder: Please add the family members and guardians who will play an important role for your higher education.
46 - 19 Dec 2023 02:00PM - +263 71 597 4800: And also , like I said I will be at Madokero where my mom's aunt stays , she said I can use her wifi for this counseling session so maybe I can ask her to join too

14 - 19 Dec 2023 12:33PM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
15 - 19 Dec 2023 12:33PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
16 - 19 Dec 2023 12:33PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17 - 19 Dec 2023 12:33PM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
18 - 19 Dec 2023 12:33PM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19 - 19 Dec 2023 12:33PM - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

22 - 19 Dec 2023 12:34PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23 - 19 Dec 2023 12:43PM - +260 763785676: I am looking forward to be a part of Edoofa so that I can become independent,take responsibility towards my higher education by myself and help my parents reduce the financial burden.I would really love to do all that for my myself and family
24 - 19 Dec 2023 01:12PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Deborah, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
25 - 19 Dec 2023 01:16PM - +260 763785676: Yes. I think I have what it takes to meet the two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship
26 - 19 Dec 2023 01:28PM - Gurvinder: That is great.

73 - 18 Dec 2023 09:41PM - +263 78 441 2796: First off, l was   motivated by the desire to understand what makes organizations successful in today's competitive global business landscape. This includes gaining the knowledge and skills required to navigate and thrive in a saturated market.  Then there's the aspect of leadership development. Business management studies often involve the acquisition of leadership skills, which is all about the ability to motivate and inspire others to contribute towards the success of an organization.  Additionally, business management education can strengthen project management capabilities and provide insights into investment and finance, offering a comprehensive understanding of what drives the global economy.  For some, the appeal lies in the opportunity to develop personal leadership skills, manage and motivate people at work, and apply management principles in real-world scenarios. It's all about personal development and sociability in the workplace.  And of course, there are those who are motivated by a curiosity about what motivates people to buy goods or adopt certain behaviors. This curiosity can lead to a focus on people management, finance, marketplace analysis, and business planning.  These motivations collectively highlight the multifaceted appeal of studying business management, encompassing aspects such as leadership development, communication skills, understanding organizational success, and personal growth.  The above is what motivates me in the field of  business Management some of which l did not mention above.

8 - 19 Dec 2023 09:44AM - Gurvinder: Good Morning Kasonde!  I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
9 - 19 Dec 2023 09:46AM - +260 96 5422579: Good morning  What I understand about Edoofa scholarship program is that it's a program that offers students scholarships to study abroad
10 - 19 Dec 2023 10:28AM - Gurvinder: Noted.
11 - 19 Dec 2023 10:29AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
12 - 19 Dec 2023 10:29AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
13 - 19 Dec 2023 10:29AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14 - 19 Dec 2023 10:29AM - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19 - 19 Dec 2023 10:30AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20 - 19 Dec 2023 10:34AM - +260 96 5422579: Thank you
21 - 19 Dec 2023 10:34AM - +260 96 5422579: Notted

24 - 19 Dec 2023 12:00PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Kasonde, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
25 - 19 Dec 2023 12:04PM - +260 96 5422579: Yes I do
26 - 19 Dec 2023 12:12PM - +260 97 8385120: Noted with thanks

Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3.

Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

38 - 19 Dec 2023 03:33PM - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study journalism and mass communication, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
39 - 19 Dec 2023 03:38PM - +260 767735131: Seeing that a lot of people these days go for these courses like nursing and at the end of their study they have struggles in getting jobs, I personally feel journalism is not taken that seriously in Zambia like a lot of people have no interest in studying it and if I was given an opportunity to study journalism abroad I can at least probably learn a lot of different things that here are not taught and when back I share the knowledge and encourage people on what I would learn from there
40 - 19 Dec 2023 04:02PM - Gurvinder: Your perspective on journalism and mass communication in Zambia is quite true, Kulela. It's true that certain fields, like nursing, often attract many students, sometimes leading to challenges in job opportunities due to high competition. On the other hand, journalism might not be as popular, yet it holds immense potential and significance.
41 - 19 Dec 2023 04:02PM - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
42 - 19 Dec 2023 04:10PM - +260 767735131: No one has pursued a career in this field and if I do I'll be the first one and even encourage the others
43 - 19 Dec 2023 04:15PM - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your Garde 10 and Grade 12 results for evaluation?
44 - 19 Dec 2023 04:34PM - +260 767735131: So I'll have to re download my results again which am currently working on can we proceed and I send the results onwards??

44 - 19 Dec 2023 04:04PM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
45 - 19 Dec 2023 04:04PM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

About the EDOOFA Program and it‚Äôs vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*  *2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*  *3. Also, the financial aspect involved*  *4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

308 - 19 Dec 2023 12:11PM - +263 77 388 8622: The questions are: 1. On travelling arrangements to and from India will the students sponsor themselves or they are helped. 2. Will the student or Wynne be able to get full scholarship for the course. 3. After completing the course, will be able to get a job there in India or internationally. 4. On the registration fee required, how come that they apply before writing the exams or before results are out. What will happen in case one fails to meet the required standards. 5.Will the students be given accommodation and all necessary for the upkeep of themselves.
309 - 19 Dec 2023 12:49PM - Gurvinder: 1. The cost of travelling is a one-time expense that you have to bear, but let me assure you that our VISA experts will be there to guide you through the process. 2. Yes getting a full scholarship is possible but that depends on the counselling sessions, the interview, and your child's results. 3. Mr Walter in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners that provide students with good-paying jobs! You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities. 4. The students are able to apply before the results are out as that helps us to get them a scholarship seat early which increases their chances of getting a higher quantum of scholarship, and also if they fail to meet the requirements, then the enrollment fee is refunded. 5. The students can avail accommodation inside the University only which is affordable and the cost estimation is included in the $2700 to $3700 annual fee which I shared with you earlier.

After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

333 - 19 Dec 2023 02:50PM - Gurvinder: As you know due to the acting policies and standards of the Academic Board the Board is not viable to change the 7-day deadline period. However, after careful consideration, they might be willing to consider your situation and provide, you with a part fee payment plan of $100. Which will have to be completed within the next 7 days to secure your child's seat. You can then pay 2nd $100 to complete the enrollment formalities by the 10th Of Janauary.
334 - 19 Dec 2023 03:25PM - +263 71 257 9261: I would want you to clarify on first instalment
335 - 19 Dec 2023 03:31PM - Gurvinder: The Academic Board has rules about deadlines that they can't change. But after thinking about your situation, they're willing to help. They're offering a way for you to pay a part of the fee, which is $100. This $100 is really important because it's what you need to pay within the next 7 days to make sure your child can join the program.  Once you pay this first $100, it secures your child's spot. After that, you'll have some more time until January 10th to pay the second $100 and then after 30 days of that you have to pay the remaining $150.  Paying this first $100 in the next 7 days is super important to make sure your child can be a part of the program.

The main reason arising from this is that the people who were offended still hold a grudge to the inhuman killing that transpired. In an interview the survivers of the war still look back and they still can't let go of it. It seems as if the incident still haunts them of how they lost their loved ones. One man in Rwanda said that he lost a lot of infrastructure, livestock and his relatives. Additionally six of his children were killed including his wife. He still complains that non of the people came to him and apologized for what they had done Interms of infrastructure that was damaged Rwanda still faces a challenge to rebuild what was lost. There is a complaint that people who have money still can't have good services. One of the services which couldn't be offered to the people was electricity. Even healthy services cannot be easily accessed in Rwanda. In Rwanda millions of people after the war live on tiny plots with big families. This arises from the fact that people lack the knowledge on family planning. Most homes are overcrowded with relatives who survived the war. This is indeed dangerous as in it can lead to disease outbreak easily within a community On the positive side people after the war have been counselled and it can be seen that the people have learnt to forgive each other. Further more it has been seen that people in Rwanda are trying by all means possible to stop tribal conflict. It is encouraged that intermarriages should be practiced to avoid such occurences. Furthermore the government, in collaboration with it's citizen, is working tirelessly to bring Rwanda into a middle income nation where each human being can aquire basic needs with no stress at all. Life has really been rough for school going children in that they live in fear of being attacked. It Connor be argued that Rwanda will soon catch up with the rest of the world and aquire necessary peace needed for development

As soon as they entered my room one of them mentioned Ben Carson. I asked what was up with this Ben Carson then everyone got on top of their voices and started shouting on what great things he had done. I then asked one of them to explain about him then he told me to read a book titled Gifted hands. After reading this book I really got inspired to aim higher in life Ben Carson is a Neuro surgeon who had a poor education foundation. But through hard work and determination he became the world's best doctor. Ben Carson was a poor young boy  raised by a single mother which meant that life was hard for him. He wasn't good in terms of school but his mother encouraged him and he was able to achieve greater things. Yes that's Ben Carson and I want to be great like him.

140 - 19 Dec 2023 12:34PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
141 - 19 Dec 2023 12:34PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*

142 - 19 Dec 2023 12:34PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
143 - 19 Dec 2023 12:35PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
144 - 19 Dec 2023 12:35PM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

162 - 19 Dec 2023 01:26PM - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
163 - 19 Dec 2023 01:44PM - +263 77 834 7813: I believe so , yes this may benefit me to a greater extent in that I will get a chance to pay my own tuition and also gain work experience
164 - 19 Dec 2023 02:03PM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Tadiwanashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
165 - 19 Dec 2023 02:38PM - +263 77 834 7813: That is amazing
166 - 19 Dec 2023 02:39PM - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

261 - 19 Dec 2023 03:36PM - +263 78 828 3084: SECTION 5 : ESSAY WRITING  16 years after the genocide, Rwanda has made significant progress. The country has rebuilt its infrastructure and economy, and has implemented a number of policies aimed at promoting reconciliation and healing. However, there are still challenges that the country faces. In terms of infrastructure, Rwanda has made significant strides in rebuilding roads, hospitals, and schools. The country has also seen a significant increase in foreign investment, which has helped to boost the economy. The government's policy of ""reconciliation villages"" has been particularly successful in promoting healing. In these villages, people who committed genocide and people who were victimized by the genocide live together and work on rebuilding their communities. This policy has helped to break down barriers between people and has allowed them to learn to trust and respect one another. However, the country still faces a number of challenges. One challenge is the high level of poverty. Although the economy has grown, many people still struggle to make ends meet. Another challenge is the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, which has affected a significant percentage of the population.Another challenge facing Rwanda is the issue of justice and accountability. Many of the perpetrators of the genocide have not been brought to justice. This has caused some victims to feel that their voices have not been heard and that justice has not been served. Additionally, there is a lack of trust in the government and institutions, as some people feel that the government has not done enough to address the root causes of the genocide. Despite these challenges, Rwanda has made remarkable progress in the 16 years since the genocide. The country has shown that it is possible to rebuild and move forward, even after such a devastating event. Rwanda's experience is an inspiration to other
262 - 19 Dec 2023 04:34PM - +263 78 828 3084: Section 6:Personality Test  My inspirational story  ""I'll never forget the day my father died. It was a warm spring day, and everything seemed normal, but then my mother's face turned pale as she answered the phone. I could tell something was wrong by the way she spoke in a quiet, serious tone. My heart sank when I heard the words 'died' and 'hospital.' My father had passed away from a sudden heart attack. The grief was overwhelming, but my mother and I had to face reality and find a way to move forward. We had very little money, and paying for school fees became very hard The days and weeks after my father's death were difficult for my mother and me. We had to learn how to live without my father's income, and it was a struggle to pay for the necessities, let alone school fees. My mother tried to keep our lives as normal as possible, but there were many nights when we went to bed hungry. She did everything she could to make sure I had what I needed to succeed in school, even if it meant going without food or other comforts. My mother's sacrifice and determination were an inspiration to me and i vowed to make the best of my life and make something of myself. I am determined to make my father proud and live a life that honors his memory  The difficult times my mother and I faced after my father's death taught me many valuable lessons. I learned that resilience and determination can overcome even the most difficult challenges. With hard work and perseverance, we can achieve our goals, no matter what obstacles we face. As I look back on this experience, I am grateful for the strength and courage my mother showed, and I know that I can overcome any obstacle that comes my way. I am proud of what I have accomplished, and  I know that anything is possible if you believe in yourself and never give up.
263 - 19 Dec 2023 04:34PM - +263 78 828 3084: I'm done with my test Mr Gurvinder
264 - 19 Dec 2023 05:03PM - +263 77 354 4503: Good evening mr Gurvinder  So from the document i understand that you have a well structured budget which can help me manage my finances effectively and ensure that i have prepared for tadiwa's education and also i should provide emotional support as a mother and encouragement to tadiwa throught his decision making and the Edoofa program makes the foreign education affordable and accessible by bringing the cost of education less than we pay here in our country .... and also if tadiwa gets a full scholarship on tuition and accomodation i will be expected to manage the cost of food and lastly each Edoofa student  actively participates in EWYL program this will allow the student to earn an average of USD 50 to usd 100usd each month

65 - 19 Dec 2023 10:04AM - Gurvinder: As much as I'd love to offer a pilot aviation course through the Edoofa program, it's important to note that the availability of courses under a scholarship program like Edoofa can be influenced by various factors.  Aviation courses, especially pilot training, come with exceptionally high costs due to the specialised training, equipment, and flight hours required. Often, scholarship programs like Edoofa focus on more traditional academic courses due to their broader applicability and feasibility within their budgetary constraints.  The expenses associated with aviation courses, particularly pilot training, can surpass the scholarship resources. Additionally, these courses might have specific requirements or certifications that extend beyond the scope of what the scholarship program can offer.  However, if you would like to go ahead with the counselling session, I would love to offer you an Academic course.

34 - 19 Dec 2023 02:08PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
35 - 19 Dec 2023 02:10PM - +260 96 5067812: Yes sir
36 - 19 Dec 2023 02:30PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Taizibei, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
37 - 19 Dec 2023 02:32PM - +260 96 5067812: Yes sir
38 - 19 Dec 2023 02:47PM - Gurvinder: Now Taizibei, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent‚Äôs highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

117 - 19 Dec 2023 09:48AM - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
118 - 19 Dec 2023 09:48AM - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
119 - 19 Dec 2023 09:48AM - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.

239 - 19 Dec 2023 12:26PM - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
240 - 19 Dec 2023 12:26PM - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
241 - 19 Dec 2023 12:26PM - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.

131 - 19 Dec 2023 09:22AM - Pallika Edoofa: Arnold, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it",No,Yes

106 - 19 Dec 2023 11:36AM - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
107 - 19 Dec 2023 11:36AM - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
108 - 19 Dec 2023 12:14PM - +263 78 539 1140: Its a beneficial program indeed . Financially it  helps the students pay their fees and it can also be seen as a program that also help to decrease the financial burden for parents .It also help one to support him or herself.it can also be noted that there will be high probability of getting employment .L love this program its really beneficial as it enables one to support herself financially even in the future .
109 - 19 Dec 2023 12:15PM - +263 78 539 1140: This is definitely the real definition of Making future . Earning while learning
110 - 19 Dec 2023 12:32PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.   We are left with 5 and 6.

(The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

260 - 19 Dec 2023 04:02PM - +263 78 358 0338: My family really wants me to study in India .A reputable country for medical sciences.They are very glad about it Mr Sahil
261 - 19 Dec 2023 04:20PM - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
262 - 19 Dec 2023 04:20PM - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
263 - 19 Dec 2023 04:20PM - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
264 - 19 Dec 2023 04:20PM - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
265 - 19 Dec 2023 04:20PM - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 23rd   or 24th December 2023 for $200 and the 23rd   or 24th of January  for the remaining $150. 2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 23rd   or 24th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?",No,Yes

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Dube's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.  Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?

Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
274 - 19 Dec 2023 12:59PM - +27 60 341 3656: No I'm not familiar with it can you please share it with me if possible
275 - 19 Dec 2023 01:17PM - Sahil Edoofa: -**let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?  3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?  5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program?  6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee? 7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

269 - 19 Dec 2023 11:45AM - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
270 - 19 Dec 2023 11:45AM - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
271 - 19 Dec 2023 11:45AM - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

The major reason for opening the Seat Reservation opportunity for Zimbabwean students is that they receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations were declared on *7th August this year*, Malawians received their MSCE results in September, Zambians receive the results this year itself when compared to Zimsec A level results(January-February 2024), and they are declared much earlier and the students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity. *So we already have 700+ Zimbabwean students who have qualified for the next intake.*
286 - 18 Dec 2023 05:12PM - Sahil Edoofa: Also,  do you feel a few months after the results will be sufficient for you to plan and prepare for this huge decision of your child's higher education abroad considering the economic crisis and hyperinflation in Zimbabwe?

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tendai's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.  Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?

She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

188 - 18 Dec 2023 08:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
189 - 18 Dec 2023 08:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?

195 - 19 Dec 2023 09:35AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
196 - 19 Dec 2023 09:35AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

200 - 19 Dec 2023 10:01AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
201 - 19 Dec 2023 10:01AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

I lived with my parents from childhood until I attained my ordinary level in the year 1992 at Mwenezi govt secondary school.I passed my ordinary level but failed to progress with my education due to financial constraints since iam a third born in a family of 8 children. As for my job I work as a loss control guard in the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ).I have a certificate in security management course which is my highest qualification. Iam motivated by the high spirit of my son Hopewell Herbert as education is concerned.I had enough of my setbacks financially which was a major issue in undertaking a bttr career and this motivates me to work hard to make sure Hopewell pursue his education and attains more in his education endeavors. Together with my spouse Tendai Regedzai cell 0771909264 we have 04 children and amongst them, Hopewell brings us hope as his name. Hopewell is a genius science student who if well resourced can be more successful.Very respectful child who have listening attributes,his weakness as a child are always that he forgets himself mostly and choose to help others.He always thinks of helping and serving others something which he can be taught to minimize.

I have confidence that you he is an exceptionally diligent student, and he will undoubtedly demonstrate his capabilities if given the right guidance!

171 - 19 Dec 2023 11:11AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I‚Äôll have to add that I‚Äôm flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
172 - 19 Dec 2023 11:11AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
173 - 19 Dec 2023 11:11AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
194 - 19 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
195 - 19 Dec 2023 04:08PM - +263 71 133 9475: 6
196 - 19 Dec 2023 04:08PM - +263 71 133 9475: we last talked about 5  enrollment
197 - 19 Dec 2023 04:09PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  *Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.  *Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
198 - 19 Dec 2023 04:09PM - +263 71 133 9475: yes
199 - 19 Dec 2023 04:29PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?
200 - 19 Dec 2023 04:48PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to be active for the next 10 minutes as we are about to conclude the session. May I know whether that is convenient for you, please?

I think having a dedicated team of professionals who can help guide me through the process of higher education is valuable. They can provide personalized guidance, help me with the application process, and offer support throughout my journey.

314 - 19 Dec 2023 10:33AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
315 - 19 Dec 2023 10:33AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
316 - 19 Dec 2023 10:33AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

318 - 19 Dec 2023 10:34AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th or 27th December 2023 for $200 and the 26th or 27th of January for the remaining $150. 2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26th or 27th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?",No,No

We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  *Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.  *Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?

209 - 19 Dec 2023 11:10AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India.

As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.  Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?

134 - 19 Dec 2023 05:20PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

414 - 19 Dec 2023 01:58PM - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
415 - 19 Dec 2023 02:00PM - +263 78 395 8654: Ok I can use 2
416 - 19 Dec 2023 02:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.  So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
417 - 19 Dec 2023 02:01PM - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  BRANCH: Mutare  ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738
418 - 19 Dec 2023 02:03PM - +263 78 395 8654: Ok thanks. I have understood, we are going to use this one for the payment
419 - 19 Dec 2023 02:43PM - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fees payment deadline mentioned in your acceptance letter?
420 - 19 Dec 2023 02:45PM - +263 78 880 5139: 24 December 2023

Edoofa's academic team will help the students to identify and choose from the one she wishes to study at.

307 - 19 Dec 2023 02:57PM - +263 78 697 5377: Yes , how about the traveling expenses from Zimbabwe to India.
308 - 19 Dec 2023 03:35PM - Shubham Madhwal: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
309 - 19 Dec 2023 03:35PM - Shubham Madhwal: So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable. Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cover the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.

310 - 19 Dec 2023 03:35PM - Shubham Madhwal: As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also acquire the visa with ease. The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $400-$600, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preperations

310 - 19 Dec 2023 03:35PM - Shubham Madhwal: As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space.

The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $400-$600, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preperations
311 - 19 Dec 2023 03:50PM - +263 78 697 5377: Very well noted‚úÖ
312 - 19 Dec 2023 04:24PM - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrolment fees payment deadline mentioned in Kudakwashe's letter?
313 - 19 Dec 2023 04:45PM - +263 77 236 8597: Enrollment fees dead line  is 24December
314 - 19 Dec 2023 04:58PM - Shubham Madhwal: And are yoou aware of the Transaction Methods as well?
315 - 19 Dec 2023 05:53PM - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected?

316 - 19 Dec 2023 05:54PM - +263 77 236 8597: Yes Sir.... very much aware of the transaction method
317 - 19 Dec 2023 05:54PM - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-  1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account 2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe  May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
318 - 19 Dec 2023 05:59PM - +263 77 236 8597: The second one ....depositing into your associate account
319 - 19 Dec 2023 06:17PM - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.
320 - 19 Dec 2023 06:17PM - Shubham Madhwal: So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe   The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  BRANCH: Mutare  ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.

113 - 19 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
114 - 19 Dec 2023 10:20AM - +260 96 0868720: Not really this is the only university I've applied to
115 - 19 Dec 2023 10:39AM - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
116 - 19 Dec 2023 11:09AM - +260 96 0868720: Yes partially I was told that it's k1500
117 - 19 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
118 - 19 Dec 2023 01:55PM - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation <This message was edited>

121 - 19 Dec 2023 02:41PM - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

125 - 19 Dec 2023 03:04PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*

231 - 19 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
232 - 19 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).
233 - 19 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.   *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
234 - 19 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
235 - 19 Dec 2023 03:03PM - +260 96 8326411: Okay
236 - 19 Dec 2023 03:04PM - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,  Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.  We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).  Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.

298 - 19 Dec 2023 11:02AM - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

303 - 19 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It‚Äôs basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
304 - 19 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

304 - 19 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
305 - 19 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
306 - 19 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
308 - 19 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
309 - 19 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
310 - 19 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
311 - 19 Dec 2023 01:16PM - +263 78 723 1295: This is the Edoofa cycle with steps one should follow to qualify or to secure a seat in Edoofa scholarship program. The first step is when one apply for the scholarship, you then go under counselling sessions with counsellers and your form will be submitted to the senior counselor where you will continue with your sessions. The second step is when you will be tested and you will go on an interview. After passing all these steps you will then receive the acceptance letter from Edoofa. You will then be enrolled into the Edoofa's program. The Admission process will then be done after the Enrollment into Edoofa. Lastly you will receive the Admission letter and Visa
312 - 19 Dec 2023 01:56PM - +263 78 723 1295: Oky thank you
313 - 19 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Shubham Madhwal: That‚Äôs great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
314 - 19 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
315 - 19 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
316 - 19 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
317 - 19 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
318 - 19 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
319 - 19 Dec 2023 03:55PM - +263 78 723 1295: The most interesting thing about Edoofa is that it offers higher Education Concierge. One thing l like the most about this fact is that you will be guided throughout the procedure until you reach your destination. This influences and encourages others who will be afraid of human trafficking since you will be going to a foreign land. Another thing is that it gives the students the zeal to continue working extra hard knowing that they have their support
320 - 19 Dec 2023 04:04PM - +263 73 242 8998: To us as parents and guardians we value the fact that Edoofa program is affordable through guaranted scholarships as well as the Earn While you learn (EWYL) which will zero down to  affordability.
321 - 19 Dec 2023 04:09PM - +263 73 242 8998: So all the points are very important hence it is very challenging to choose only one as the most.
322 - 19 Dec 2023 04:58PM - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?

314 - 19 Dec 2023 01:23PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

If it pleass you I can send you my o-levels results which are very pleasing. I'm still doing great in my form 6 and the outcomes show that I can get 15 points at the final.   About your question ma'am, here in Zimbabwe it's very hard for a middle class family like ours to raise such amounts of 2000_ 3000 US dollars and still earn a living . Therefore, it's hard for a family like ours to raise the money for the tuition. So , I kindly beg of you if by any means I can get the scholarship and fulfill my childhood vision of being a lawyer.",No,Yes

97 - 19 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
98 - 19 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
99 - 19 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

100 - 19 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Tushti: <Media omitted>
101 - 19 Dec 2023 10:18AM - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
103 - 19 Dec 2023 10:35AM - +263 77 302 5192: Ok l understand about the costs .....l heard you said students will write various tests this tests will be written on line or physically and they will be written on the subjects you want to do or it will be a general test for the program you want to do
104 - 19 Dec 2023 10:39AM - Tushti: The test would be a general test
105 - 19 Dec 2023 10:39AM - Tushti: Can you tell me what amount you would be expected to pay after the scholarship?
106 - 19 Dec 2023 10:42AM - +263 77 302 5192: It‚Äôs ok

109 - 19 Dec 2023 11:04AM - Tushti: Now, shall I brief you about the EWYL Program?
110 - 19 Dec 2023 11:09AM - +263 77 302 5192: It‚Äôs ok looking for the affordability now they may raise from 800-1400us
111 - 19 Dec 2023 11:11AM - +263 77 302 5192: Yes you can brief me
112 - 19 Dec 2023 11:13AM - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
142 - 19 Dec 2023 11:43AM - Tushti: Yes!
143 - 19 Dec 2023 11:44AM - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
144 - 19 Dec 2023 11:44AM - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
145 - 19 Dec 2023 11:44AM - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
146 - 19 Dec 2023 11:53AM - +263 77 302 5192: Ok they saw the payment policy
147 - 19 Dec 2023 12:12PM - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
148 - 19 Dec 2023 12:12PM - Tushti: <Media omitted>
149 - 19 Dec 2023 12:12PM - Tushti: Alright Bright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.  Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
150 - 19 Dec 2023 12:12PM - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
151 - 19 Dec 2023 12:12PM - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).",No,Yes

23 - 19 Dec 2023 12:45PM - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to plan to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
