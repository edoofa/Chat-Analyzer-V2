In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

126 - 09 Feb 2024 11:14AM - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes,  *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *Earn While You Learn Program and training* *University sessions and selection* *A guaranteed scholarship seat* *Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
127 - 09 Feb 2024 11:15AM - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
128 - 09 Feb 2024 11:23AM - +263 78 145 5948: Alright
129 - 09 Feb 2024 11:25AM - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.  The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
136 - 09 Feb 2024 11:53AM - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
137 - 09 Feb 2024 11:53AM - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
138 - 09 Feb 2024 11:53AM - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.

141 - 09 Feb 2024 06:46PM - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-  *About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.* *Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.* *The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
142 - 09 Feb 2024 06:46PM - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,  *Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* *Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*  *Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.  Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

102 - 08 Feb 2024 04:21PM - +263 78 158 2067: It's either my mom or my uncle

105 - 09 Feb 2024 09:41AM - +263 78 158 2067: Yes we can start
106 - 09 Feb 2024 10:05AM - Arshita: Greetings!
107 - 09 Feb 2024 10:05AM - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.  May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
108 - 09 Feb 2024 10:07AM - +263 78 158 2067: Everything is okay. Mom is encouraging me to do well so that I can study abroad
109 - 09 Feb 2024 10:19AM - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
110 - 09 Feb 2024 10:19AM - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone*  *1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.  *2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.  *3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university. Do you know about other requirements?
119 - 09 Feb 2024 10:34AM - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.  The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.

Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with steps 5 and 6.

180 - 09 Feb 2024 11:55AM - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.   3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.   4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

183 - 09 Feb 2024 07:55AM - +260 96 6221187: Edoofa's enrollment process consists of three phases. In Phase 1, students and parents participate in a counseling session and reserve a seat for the program. To secure the seat, a partial payment of $350 must be made within seven days of receiving the Edoofa Reservation Letter. This payment covers the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  Phase 2 involves students starting their Earn While You Learn program classes. During this phase, students have the opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce their fees before their A-Level results are released.  In Phase 3, after the final A-Level results are out, students who meet the necessary requirements proceed with their final university evaluation and admission. If a student doesn't meet the requirements, the $350 paid during Phase 1 will be refunded to the parents.  Edoofa aims to assist students in arranging and paying their finances independently. The credits earned by students during Phase 2 can be applied towards their first year's annual fee, alleviating the burden on parents. This financial support empowers students to take charge of their own finances and pursue their academic dreams.

In Phase 3, after the final A-Level results are out, students who meet the necessary requirements proceed with their final university evaluation and admission. If a student doesn't meet the requirements, the $350 paid during Phase 1 will be refunded to the parents.  Edoofa aims to assist students in arranging and paying their finances independently. The credits earned by students during Phase 2 can be applied towards their first year's annual fee, alleviating the burden on parents. This financial support empowers students to take charge of their own finances and pursue their academic dreams.

82 - 09 Feb 2024 12:05PM - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood the course properly.  Can you now tell me, if you are provided with this career option, how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course? And if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
89 - 09 Feb 2024 12:46PM - +263 71 139 6111: Well l would share new skills and experiences that l would have gained from abroad through creating learning groups on social media or in person , this will promote and improve the quality of education in my country .
90 - 09 Feb 2024 12:48PM - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Gloria, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don’t you agree?
91 - 09 Feb 2024 12:49PM - +263 71 139 6111: I agree ma'am
92 - 09 Feb 2024 12:56PM - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.  I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
93 - 09 Feb 2024 01:06PM - +263 71 139 6111: Yes ,l been wondering though
94 - 09 Feb 2024 02:05PM - Garima Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons  *1.

I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

118 - 09 Feb 2024 03:26PM - +263 71 139 6111: No I'm not aware ma'am enlighten us
119 - 09 Feb 2024 03:27PM - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.  The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.  Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*",No,Yes

In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

259 - 08 Feb 2024 06:17PM - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*  Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time.

262 - 09 Feb 2024 11:15AM - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263714556333 , Hope you are doing well.
263 - 09 Feb 2024 11:15AM - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
264 - 09 Feb 2024 12:06PM - +263 71 455 6333: If we assume that the average cost of applying to one university is $350, and a student applies to five universities, the total cost would be $1,750. This is a significant amount of money, and it doesn't even guarantee admission or a scholarship. In some cases, students may end up spending even more money if they need to take an entrance exam or language test. Additionally, they may need to pay for travel and visa costs, as well as for living expenses in the host country. All of these costs can add up, making studying abroad a significant financial investment.
265 - 09 Feb 2024 12:06PM - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

135 - 09 Feb 2024 10:49AM - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, @263773023555 . I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.  Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
136 - 09 Feb 2024 10:56AM - +263 77 302 3555: Actually I'm not aware madam it very very expensive
137 - 09 Feb 2024 10:58AM - +263 77 302 3555: I'm aware that it is very very expensive ,ignore the above statement please, mistaken👆🏽👆🏽👆🏽
138 - 09 Feb 2024 11:50AM - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you have a better clarity for the same.
139 - 09 Feb 2024 11:50AM - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.  The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.  Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
140 - 09 Feb 2024 11:50AM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
141 - 09 Feb 2024 11:51AM - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
142 - 09 Feb 2024 11:54AM - +263 77 302 3555: Yes please madam very very affordable
141 - 09 Feb 2024 11:51AM - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for your family?
142 - 09 Feb 2024 11:54AM - +263 77 302 3555: Yes please madam very very affordable
143 - 09 Feb 2024 11:56AM - Garima Edoofa: In simple words @263773023555 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
144 - 09 Feb 2024 11:56AM - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts on the same?
145 - 09 Feb 2024 12:02PM - +263 77 302 3555: My thoughts are that, edoofa is too good for the students as well as to us as parents because it help so I and reduce the expenses
146 - 09 Feb 2024 12:33PM - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
147 - 09 Feb 2024 12:33PM - +263 77 302 3555: Yes madam
148 - 09 Feb 2024 12:35PM - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
149 - 09 Feb 2024 12:35PM - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.   1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
150 - 09 Feb 2024 12:36PM - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
151 - 09 Feb 2024 12:36PM - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
152 - 09 Feb 2024 12:36PM - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
153 - 09 Feb 2024 12:36PM - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
154 - 09 Feb 2024 04:55PM - +263 77 302 3555: Yes it benefit us a lot as our children are highly imployed quickly
155 - 09 Feb 2024 04:56PM - +263 77 302 3555: Yes it benefit us a lot as our children are highly imployed quickly
156 - 09 Feb 2024 07:38PM - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
157 - 09 Feb 2024 07:38PM - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

13 - 09 Feb 2024 09:30AM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
14 - 09 Feb 2024 09:30AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15 - 09 Feb 2024 09:30AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

16 - 09 Feb 2024 09:30AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17 - 09 Feb 2024 09:30AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19 - 09 Feb 2024 09:38AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Ayanda, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20 - 09 Feb 2024 09:40AM - +263 78 235 8572: I'm not sure but I hope I do have what it takes.
21 - 09 Feb 2024 09:42AM - Gurvinder: That is great.
22 - 09 Feb 2024 09:42AM - Gurvinder: Now Ayanda, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent’s highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
23 - 09 Feb 2024 10:11AM - +263 78 235 8572: •I completed highschool (A level) sometime back.I wasn't a very good student but I was persistent.Not particularly driven to be the best or to do the best but I was motivated to obtain results that I felt were acceptable.  •In all honesty I don't have a specific course I would like to do.I just want a job with a salary big enough that it would enable me to take care of myslf and my family and perhaps venture into starting up an enterprise, which is something I've always wanted to do.  •On the issue of my parents occupations, my mother is a highschool teacher and my father is a qualified teacher however he is self employed in the moment due to the fact that there are better prospects for him outside teaching.  •Both my parents have been supporting me .  •Both my parents will be supporting me financially for my higher education. I have since completed my A level.  •I studied at John Tallach High School in the Matebeleland North province.  •I have 3 siblings .Two are currently in primary school and one is in university.  •My school fees was $700 per term <This message was edited>

25 - 09 Feb 2024 11:23AM - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board. We make sure the opportunity is provided to deserving students who are well inclined to their career paths. Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
26 - 09 Feb 2024 11:23AM - Gurvinder: Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?

169 - 09 Feb 2024 10:27AM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
170 - 09 Feb 2024 10:46AM - +260 777754748: Yes
171 - 09 Feb 2024 11:44AM - Gurvinder: Beene as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
172 - 09 Feb 2024 11:48AM - +260 777754748: $1500 -$2250
173 - 09 Feb 2024 11:58AM - Gurvinder: Exactly Beene, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
166 - 09 Feb 2024 09:34AM - +260 777754748: Yes

169 - 09 Feb 2024 10:27AM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
170 - 09 Feb 2024 10:46AM - +260 777754748: Yes
171 - 09 Feb 2024 11:44AM - Gurvinder: Beene as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
172 - 09 Feb 2024 11:48AM - +260 777754748: $1500 -$2250
173 - 09 Feb 2024 11:58AM - Gurvinder: Exactly Beene, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

176 - 09 Feb 2024 12:48PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
177 - 09 Feb 2024 12:49PM - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.  Don’t you think so?
178 - 09 Feb 2024 12:49PM - +260 777754748: I do
179 - 09 Feb 2024 12:51PM - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
180 - 09 Feb 2024 12:52PM - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation  If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.  Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).   Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.   The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.  However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.",No,Yes

56 - 09 Feb 2024 09:47AM - Gurvinder: Brian, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
57 - 09 Feb 2024 09:47AM - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are  1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics  2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology  3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology  4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology  5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy  6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology  7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry  8.

56 - 09 Feb 2024 10:03AM - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.  I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
57 - 09 Feb 2024 10:06AM - +27 83 890 4515: Yes mister
58 - 09 Feb 2024 10:52AM - +27 83 890 4515: But there must be more that they will gain by studying in India and not any other country
59 - 09 Feb 2024 11:48AM - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
60 - 09 Feb 2024 11:48AM - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*  1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.  2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.  3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.  4. *Faculty Expertise:* Skilled faculty bring real-world expertise to the classroom, guiding your academic journey.  5. *Global Recognition and Careers:* Indian degrees open doors worldwide, paving the way for global success.  6. *Cultural Diversity and Campus Life:* Experience a vibrant campus life with cultural festivals and a rich heritage.  7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* India offers quality education at a lower cost and provides scholarships to support you.  8. *English Medium of Instruction:* Most courses are taught in English, ensuring a smooth learning experience.  9. *Research and Innovation:* Engage in cutting-edge research, fostering critical thinking and creativity.

82 - 09 Feb 2024 12:18PM - Gurvinder: Mr Murambinda in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!  You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
83 - 09 Feb 2024 12:26PM - +27 83 890 4515: Thank you for highlighting all this to me.I wish you can offer my daughter this opportunity

87 - 09 Feb 2024 01:07PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
88 - 09 Feb 2024 01:07PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*",No,Yes

18 - 09 Feb 2024 09:44AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19 - 09 Feb 2024 09:44AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23 - 09 Feb 2024 09:44AM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24 - 09 Feb 2024 09:44AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
25 - 09 Feb 2024 09:48AM - +260 765019328: Yes That's actually very true.

30 - 09 Feb 2024 11:46AM - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Katongo.
31 - 09 Feb 2024 11:47AM - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study medicine, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
32 - 09 Feb 2024 12:05PM - +260 765019328: I have a very strong desire to help others
25 - 09 Feb 2024 09:48AM - +260 765019328: Yes That's actually very true.
26 - 09 Feb 2024 10:00AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Katongo, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27 - 09 Feb 2024 10:02AM - +260 765019328: I definitely have what it takes to meet the two significant metrics.
28 - 09 Feb 2024 10:24AM - Gurvinder: Now Katongo, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-  1. Your highest education level? 2. The course you would like to study? 3. What do your parents do? 4. What is your parent’s highest education level? 5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far? 6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad? 7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way <This message was edited>

33 - 09 Feb 2024 12:11PM - Gurvinder: That is a noble motivation.
34 - 09 Feb 2024 12:12PM - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
35 - 09 Feb 2024 12:15PM - +260 765019328: No
36 - 09 Feb 2024 12:16PM - +260 765019328: I would be the first person

39 - 09 Feb 2024 12:26PM - +260 765019328: I'm currently only having my Grade 12 results
40 - 09 Feb 2024 12:49PM - Gurvinder: Katongo, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
41 - 09 Feb 2024 12:49PM - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are  1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics  2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology  3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology  4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology  5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy  6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology  7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry  8. Bachelor of science in Optometry

12 - 09 Feb 2024 12:18PM - +260 96 8631068: The edoofa scholarship program is a social, for-profit organization that offers 50% to 100% scholarship to students. The program also helps students aquire skills that help them earn jobs in various industries.
13 - 09 Feb 2024 12:26PM - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
17 - 09 Feb 2024 12:26PM - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

21 - 09 Feb 2024 12:32PM - +260 96 8631068: Yes I am. And everything is well noted. Thank you for the information.
22 - 09 Feb 2024 12:50PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Lenganji, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship? <This message was edited>

59 - 09 Feb 2024 12:10PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
60 - 09 Feb 2024 12:11PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
61 - 09 Feb 2024 12:11PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
64 - 09 Feb 2024 12:16PM - +260 774345791: How can I apply for a hundred percent scholarship or maybe 80%
65 - 09 Feb 2024 12:25PM - Gurvinder: Please that will be decided after the interview.

70 - 09 Feb 2024 12:50PM - +260 774345791: Yes do so
71 - 09 Feb 2024 12:52PM - Gurvinder: Moses, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

73 - 09 Feb 2024 01:19PM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.

138 - 09 Feb 2024 08:48AM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Nokutendaishe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

18 - 09 Feb 2024 10:25AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19 - 09 Feb 2024 10:25AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20 - 09 Feb 2024 10:25AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

21 - 09 Feb 2024 10:25AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
22 - 09 Feb 2024 10:27AM - +263 71 132 0162: That is true

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1.

Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24 - 09 Feb 2024 11:29AM - +263 71 132 0162: I certainly will meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship

The curriculum typically covers topics such as human behavior, social policy, research methods, and interventions for individuals and groups facing challenges such as poverty, discrimination, mental illness, and substance abuse. Students also learn about ethics, cultural competence, advocacy, and social justice in order to effectively support clients and promote positive change in society.

They provide support, advocacy, and resources to help clients navigate difficult situations and access the services they need.

333 - 09 Feb 2024 10:33AM - +263 77 395 8637: May we know , after the $2000-3000$ once of payment is made , what further costs would we face in the following years in terms of fees per month
334 - 09 Feb 2024 11:01AM - +263 77 395 8637: As your may know our country's economy has been shaky for the longest and the employment crisis is at its peak in every sector and industry,  retrenchments being a commonality,  all in the best interests of the child as we think about the future as anything can happen in the event of a misfortune, We'd like to know in the following years he's doing his studies what would the expenditure structure be like?....
335 - 09 Feb 2024 11:52AM - Gurvinder: Please, as I told you, the cost of education would remain the same, that is $2000-3000 per yearw which can be reduced too by the EWYL program, and as explained here, in the first year too, it won't exceed your budget, plus if you want you can even enrol for the next year's intake, which would give her enough time to even earn her whole first year's fee through the EWYL program. <This message was edited>
336 - 09 Feb 2024 11:53AM - Gurvinder: You see during our founder’s visit this year, we encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, those student shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.  It's evident from these experiences that many students regret not taking the benefit of The Edoofa Program's opportunity earlier. As your counselor, I understand the challenges in your home country. What are your thoughts or insights on this situation, @263773958637 ?
337 - 09 Feb 2024 12:00PM - +263 77 395 8637: Good afternoon ,I think it's best we take this route and enrol next year, and in the mean time we work on a better budget ,thank you
338 - 09 Feb 2024 12:08PM - Gurvinder: @263773958637 Please understand that the EWYL program can only be started for the child if she enrols with the program this year, enrolling now would help your child to start the EWYL program now, collect scholarship credits until the next year's intake, will teach her to be responsible for her own education, and would save you the cost of reapplication fee.

199 - 09 Feb 2024 11:17AM - Harmehak: Mr Collins, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?

201 - 09 Feb 2024 11:35AM - Harmehak: So now given the finances in India, are you in a better position relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
202 - 09 Feb 2024 12:33PM - +263 77 802 9339: Yes indeed
203 - 09 Feb 2024 12:35PM - Harmehak: That's great,  Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
204 - 09 Feb 2024 12:35PM - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
205 - 09 Feb 2024 12:35PM - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.",No,No

331 - 09 Feb 2024 11:52AM - Keshav Edoofa: *MAXIMUM MARKS: 50*  *_SECTION 1:- PERSONAL INFORMATION_*  Name as per School Record- Gender- Date of Birth as per School Record- Father's Name- Mother's Name- Email Address- Parent's email address-  *_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*  Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage. If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  *_SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST_*  *_Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions._* _*Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole.*_ _*After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a “NO CHANGE” option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.*_  Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6. outdo A) NO CHANGE B) defeat C) outperform D) outweigh  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE B) can pollute waterways, C) could have polluted waterways, D) has polluted waterway’s,  8.scientists; and A) NO CHANGE B) scientists: and C) scientists, and D) scientists, and,  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed A) where it is now.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit Tapiwanashe?*
104 - 09 Feb 2024 02:57PM - +263 78 801 2675: Yes
105 - 09 Feb 2024 03:00PM - +263 78 801 2675: I get it
106 - 09 Feb 2024 03:01PM - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Tapiwanashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
107 - 09 Feb 2024 03:03PM - +263 78 801 2675: Understood

139 - 09 Feb 2024 03:28PM - +263 78 801 2675: Yes
140 - 09 Feb 2024 03:29PM - Keshav Edoofa: Tapiwanashe as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

146 - 09 Feb 2024 03:53PM - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Tapiwanashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.",No,Yes

Many of us have aspired to make an impact on society and the career options in sociology bring this opportunity close.  Here are some of the most popular career options in sociology:  1. Social Worker A career in helping people and improving societies, which pretty much defines a social worker, is the most sought-after job for sociology aspirants. Sociology graduates can use the knowledge of social dynamics to analyse social issues and find ways to help resolve them. Social workers refer issues to appropriate community agencies to ensure the allotment of resources to individuals and families in need.  2. Journalist For candidates with a flair of writing and a good grasp of observing mass attitude and analyse social issues, journalism is the ideal option. Top news agencies and publications in India are always on the lookout for professionals adept in understanding social circumstances.  3. Administrative Support Top educational institutions require professionals who can assess individual and mass psychology, understand human behaviour and troubleshoot issues. Sociologists can become a part of the administrative staff at schools, colleges, and universities.  4. Rehabilitation Counsellor If you are inclined towards helping the youths of their society, this career option is ideal for you. Rehabilitation counsellors use their counselling techniques learned in sociology to guide youths who have been misled into making wrong decisions in life, who have committed a crime and have completed their penitence, and those who have been abused or traumatised by life events.  5. Family Counsellor Sociologists are adept counsellors, and that’s why their expertise can be utilised in family counselling. Family counsellors use their observation and critical thinking to assess different familial or marital issues and provide guidance in mitigation.  6. Survey Researcher As the name suggests, survey researchers conduct surveys to make various decisions. These include observing patterns of social and political issues, health and culture, and how consumers are reacting to a particular product or service. They create questionnaires, form focus groups, and get clear answers. Sociologists make use of data collection and statistical analysis techniques to gather evidence and create well-informed reports for public and private organisations.  7. Human Resources (HR) Specialist A part of being a sociologist includes interacting with a large number of people every day. This is the foundation of being an HR specialist who analyses job roles, decides if a candidate is suitable for a particular job, interviews the candidates to arrive at a decision.  8. Policy Analyst Sociologists have to study policies in their academic journey. That’s why they are hired as policy analysts to observe social issues and recommend legislators to address these issues. Sociologists can make use of their knowledge and skill to analyse sociological research data to understand if particular legislation has made a positive or negative impact on social issues and population  9. Media Planner A media planner’s job entails figuring out a plan to advertise for a product or service for a client. This requires a good grasp of mass psychology, and sociologists are taught exactly that. Top companies require experts to create market surveys, analyse data, and help marketers create advertising campaigns.

265 - 09 Feb 2024 09:31AM - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*  *Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

268 - 09 Feb 2024 11:41AM - Kunal: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.  *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).  *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.  The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.

180 - 09 Feb 2024 12:42PM - Kunal: Emmanuella, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?  1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?  2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?  3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?  5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?  6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.  7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
181 - 09 Feb 2024 12:59PM - +257 71 34 27 05: 1. Business administration 2. In India 3. $6000 to $8000 per year 4. $1500 to $2300 after the edoofa scholarship 5 . If your country has economic instabilities then you can pay $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within 30 days 6. Earn while you learn program is a program that's offered to students who do not want to put too much pressure on their parents so that program will offer then with work however it won't interfere with their learning schedules however they child will need to learn how to manage their time wisely so that they benefit from both school and work . 7. I'm not very clear about that one may you please explain further especially when you say that the annual fee will be adjusted
182 - 09 Feb 2024 01:04PM - Kunal: 4) The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000 Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.
183 - 09 Feb 2024 01:05PM - Kunal: 7) *Registration Fee* The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter.  *The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*  For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

266 - 09 Feb 2024 11:02AM - Kunal: Alright Mehluli You see a lot of students who stay in the outskirts of the towns prefer using alternative fee completion mode that saves them the traveling expenses. Since I am aware that in Zimbabwe if you have to travel from one town to another you end up spending anywhere between $5-$10 one side, which becomes expensive considering just to go to the bank and complete the formalities.  So alternatively the Board has provided flexibility to parents who wish to complete formalities to Mrs Jerera using Ecocash and Mukuru. Shall I share those details with you as well for your convenience please?

121 - 09 Feb 2024 10:14AM - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

Sociologists can become a part of the administrative staff at schools, colleges, and universities.  4. Rehabilitation Counsellor If you are inclined towards helping the youths of their society, this career option is ideal for you. Rehabilitation counsellors use their counselling techniques learned in sociology to guide youths who have been misled into making wrong decisions in life, who have committed a crime and have completed their penitence, and those who have been abused or traumatised by life events.  5. Family Counsellor Sociologists are adept counsellors, and that’s why their expertise can be utilised in family counselling. Family counsellors use their observation and critical thinking to assess different familial or marital issues and provide guidance in mitigation.  6. Survey Researcher As the name suggests, survey researchers conduct surveys to make various decisions. These include observing patterns of social and political issues, health and culture, and how consumers are reacting to a particular product or service. They create questionnaires, form focus groups, and get clear answers. Sociologists make use of data collection and statistical analysis techniques to gather evidence and create well-informed reports for public and private organisations.  7. Human Resources (HR) Specialist A part of being a sociologist includes interacting with a large number of people every day. This is the foundation of being an HR specialist who analyses job roles, decides if a candidate is suitable for a particular job, interviews the candidates to arrive at a decision.  8. Policy Analyst Sociologists have to study policies in their academic journey. That’s why they are hired as policy analysts to observe social issues and recommend legislators to address these issues. Sociologists can make use of their knowledge and skill to analyse sociological research data to understand if particular legislation has made a positive or negative impact on social issues and population  9. Media Planner A media planner’s job entails figuring out a plan to advertise for a product or service for a client. This requires a good grasp of mass psychology, and sociologists are taught exactly that. Top companies require experts to create market surveys, analyse data, and help marketers create advertising campaigns.

56 - 09 Feb 2024 11:07AM - Kunal: Noted Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Ruvimbo achieving it. <This message was edited>

62 - 09 Feb 2024 11:53AM - Kunal: I do understand , Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
63 - 09 Feb 2024 11:53AM - Kunal: Since you are not having Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest and passion in the field there are courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help you fulfil your dreams of working in this field  *Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology* *Physiotherapy* *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology* *Bachelor of Science in Optometry* *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology* etc  Would you like me to explain any of these programs to you?

288 - 09 Feb 2024 09:37AM - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Anesu, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

102 - 09 Feb 2024 11:33AM - Pallika Edoofa: Cherlyn, Yes, we do facilitate studying nursing abroad, particularly at schools of nursing or hospitals. However, the main requirement for this path is to clear the NEET exam, which serves as a mandatory entrance test for medical and dental courses in India. Additionally, subjects such as biology, physics, and chemistry are prerequisites for pursuing a career in nursing, which you currently do not possess. Therefore, if you're not inclined towards the medical field or unable to meet these subject requirements, exploring other career paths may be more suitable for you.

106 - 09 Feb 2024 11:41AM - Pallika Edoofa: Cherlyn, it's not possible for you to pass the NEET exam without the required subjects of biology, physics, and chemistry, then pursuing a career in nursing or medicine may not be feasible at this time. These subjects are fundamental to the field of healthcare and are typically non-negotiable requirements for admission to nursing programs or medical courses.

This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.   *So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*  *You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.

200 - 08 Feb 2024 11:04AM - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :  *1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.  *3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.  *4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*  After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?

109 - 09 Feb 2024 12:39PM - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.  In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.  With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
110 - 09 Feb 2024 12:41PM - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
111 - 09 Feb 2024 12:41PM - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1200-$1800, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.  *So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
112 - 09 Feb 2024 01:18PM - +263 77 293 0732: Yes
113 - 09 Feb 2024 01:58PM - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay as I was having my lunch.
114 - 09 Feb 2024 01:58PM - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.  Do you know how that is done?
115 - 09 Feb 2024 02:03PM - +263 77 293 0732: No
116 - 09 Feb 2024 02:04PM - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
117 - 09 Feb 2024 02:04PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as: *Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 *Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  *Recruitment Partners:-* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics  *Webinars:-* We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - -Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. -How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi -How to be industry-ready before graduating?

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

123 - 09 Feb 2024 10:44AM - Pallika Edoofa: That's Alright
155 - 09 Feb 2024 12:33PM - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1600-$2700, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.  *So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
156 - 09 Feb 2024 12:44PM - +263 78 547 1326: Can l get back when l talk to mom
157 - 09 Feb 2024 12:45PM - Pallika Edoofa: Sure!
158 - 09 Feb 2024 12:45PM - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.  Do you know how that is done?
159 - 09 Feb 2024 12:50PM - +263 78 547 1326: No
160 - 09 Feb 2024 01:59PM - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay as I was having my lunch.
161 - 09 Feb 2024 01:59PM - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
162 - 09 Feb 2024 01:59PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as: *Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 *Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  *Recruitment Partners:-* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics  *Webinars:-* We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - -Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. -How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi -How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu -It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje -Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
163 - 09 Feb 2024 01:59PM - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
