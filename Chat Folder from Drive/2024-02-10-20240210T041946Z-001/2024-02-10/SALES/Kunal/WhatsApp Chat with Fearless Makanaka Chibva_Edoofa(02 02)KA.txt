02/02/24, 3:05 pm - Kunal: I understand
02/02/24, 3:06 pm - Kunal: Let me add more reasons why Edoofa recommends India for higher education
02/02/24, 3:06 pm - Kunal: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System-* The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 800 universities, 39,000 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.

*2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing-*  From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.

*3. It’ Affordable-*  Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
02/02/24, 3:06 pm - Kunal: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World-*  India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics


*5.

*6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness-* India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,color,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
02/02/24, 3:10 pm - +263 78 310 2574: Ohk woow interesting facts
02/02/24, 3:10 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?

my aim is to be part of their culture,get to know more interesting facts about India that are related to my career path.
02/02/24, 3:20 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
02/02/24, 3:20 pm - +263 78 310 2574: No
02/02/24, 3:21 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

02/02/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 310 2574: Can I plz wait for my parents to reply this message,they'd reply better
02/02/24, 3:24 pm - Kunal: Sure Fearless
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
02/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 78 310 2574: No plz enlighten me
02/02/24, 3:24 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
02/02/24, 3:24 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

02/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 310 2574: Wow ohk tts interesting
02/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 78 310 2574: Yes I think
02/02/24, 3:29 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
02/02/24, 3:29 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:31 pm - +263 78 310 2574: Woow ohk 
Yes I now do realize
02/02/24, 3:31 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
02/02/24, 3:39 pm - +263 78 310 2574: The first one really made u unique from the rest.Career guidance for us children is very important,so that we don't go on the wrong direction when it comes to our career path

I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
02/02/24, 5:16 pm - +263 77 240 6658: Yaa but not that through becoz of being busy, we are traveling from Sports
02/02/24, 5:18 pm - +263 77 270 4547: Sorry for interrupting you,is there best universities in India that offer this course (Geographic information and metrology)?
02/02/24, 5:22 pm - +263 77 270 4547: For me, lm just afraid for her especially her safety.
02/02/24, 5:27 pm - Kunal: Our parent organization has worked with 250+ reputed Universities and Colleges in India. For your research and learnings let me share with you the details of some of our associate Universities

*Lovely Professional University* 

*Galgotias University* 

*MVN University* 

*Gulzar Group of Institutes(GGI)* 

*Colleges under Punjab Technical University* 

If found eligible, you will go through University sessions after which you will be receiving offer letters from different reputed Universities. You will have the liberty to choose your University.
02/02/24, 5:27 pm - Kunal: Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of your child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details
02/02/24, 5:27 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:27 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:28 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:51 pm - +263 77 240 6658: Ok thank yu,
02/02/24, 5:51 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
02/02/24, 5:53 pm - +263 77 240 6658: We didn't know but she can do that.
02/02/24, 5:53 pm - Kunal: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/02/24, 5:54 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 5:55 pm - +263 77 240 6658: Wl yu send the application form for to register together with the email address to send ?
02/02/24, 5:55 pm - Kunal: You do not have to share them now, since they are going to used during the admission process
02/02/24, 5:59 pm - +263 77 240 6658: Ok then it's fine
02/02/24, 5:59 pm - Kunal: Please address this
02/02/24, 6:02 pm - +263 77 240 6658: Ok I think Round 10 it's ok,we wl pay on or before the due dates
02/02/24, 6:02 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that your application is being opened for round 6
02/02/24, 6:03 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
02/02/24, 6:03 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
02/02/24, 6:05 pm - +263 77 240 6658: Ooh ok that's wonderful
02/02/24, 6:08 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 6:10 pm - +263 78 310 2574: This is so interesting 😄
02/02/24, 6:11 pm - +263 78 310 2574: We have done 1 and 2
02/02/24, 6:11 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
02/02/24, 6:12 pm - +263 78 310 2574: Ohh😅ohk
02/02/24, 6:12 pm - +263 78 310 2574: Yes plz ☺️
02/02/24, 6:13 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
02/02/24, 6:13 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
02/02/24, 6:15 pm - +263 78 310 2574: Ohk ohk tts clear
02/02/24, 6:15 pm - +263 78 310 2574: Yes yes we are
02/02/24, 6:20 pm - +263 77 240 6658: Ok ok
02/02/24, 7:07 pm - Kunal: Alright
We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
02/02/24, 7:07 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

 Once they complete they are already having hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally

They think it's quite cheap and affordable especially after researching on how expensive universities are from other developed countries.
They also think tt the Earn while you learn program can be of great benefit to me as I will have much experience to equip myself for the future.
They also discovered that since it's an international recognized program,I can get employment in any country.Hence it made them happy about the program.
03/02/24, 12:21 pm - Kunal: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counselling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?

08/02/24, 2:22 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand, Fearless
08/02/24, 2:23 pm - Kunal: While some may perceive studying BA Geography as solely leading to a career in teaching, this notion overlooks the vast array of career opportunities available to graduates in this field. Geography is a multidisciplinary subject that encompasses diverse areas such as environmental management, urban planning, cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, and geospatial analysis.
08/02/24, 2:24 pm - Kunal: Graduates with a BA in Geography possess valuable skills in data analysis, critical thinking, spatial reasoning, and problem-solving, which are highly sought after in various industries beyond education. They can pursue careers as environmental consultants, urban planners, GIS analysts, cartographers, climatologists, conservationists, logistics managers, and more.

08/02/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 310 2574: Ohk now I understand,it's fine
