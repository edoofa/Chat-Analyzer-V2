24/01/24, 5:41 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/01/24, 5:41 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 5:43 pm - +263 71 518 5956: That's good
24/01/24, 5:47 pm - +263 71 518 5956: I think its affordable
24/01/24, 5:49 pm - +263 71 518 5956: It's a good learning opportunity, quiet excellent for real
24/01/24, 5:49 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that <This message was edited>
24/01/24, 5:49 pm - Kunal: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
24/01/24, 5:55 pm - +263 71 518 5956: That's great and how is done Sir
24/01/24, 5:56 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
24/01/24, 5:56 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
24/01/24, 5:56 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
24/01/24, 6:00 pm - +263 71 518 5956: Quite an excellent program
24/01/24, 6:01 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 6:05 pm - +263 71 518 5956: That's amazing
24/01/24, 6:07 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
24/01/24, 6:13 pm - +263 71 518 5956: All Sir are quite important as I can see
24/01/24, 6:16 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program 
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

24/01/24, 6:17 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
24/01/24, 6:19 pm - +263 71 518 5956: I will raise it
24/01/24, 6:30 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
May I know how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
24/01/24, 6:53 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
24/01/24, 7:18 pm - +263 71 518 5956: Hi Sir, may you excuse me my phone battery is now low. May we resume tomorrow at 10am
24/01/24, 7:35 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 7:43 pm - +263 71 518 5956: That's what I am fighting for, I like it.
25/01/24, 9:40 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone

*"Education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom." - George Washington Carver*

With a positive note, I am here to resume the session
Shall we proceed?
25/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 71 518 5956: Morning Sir, yes we can.
25/01/24, 10:15 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
25/01/24, 10:15 am - Kunal: Please address this
25/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 71 518 5956: I like it so much, that's what I am fighting for
25/01/24, 10:23 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
25/01/24, 10:23 am - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
25/01/24, 10:27 am - +263 71 518 5956: Tell me other requirements plz Sir
25/01/24, 10:27 am - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
25/01/24, 10:27 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 10:31 am - +263 71 518 5956: Plz.inform me when the enrollment fee is paid
25/01/24, 10:32 am - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian* <This message was edited>
25/01/24, 10:32 am - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
25/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 71 518 5956: I understand
25/01/24, 10:36 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 71 518 5956: I think stage 3
25/01/24, 10:41 am - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
25/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 71 518 5956: Yes Sir plz explain
25/01/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
25/01/24, 10:44 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
25/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 71 518 5956: Thank you very much
25/01/24, 10:58 am - Kunal: You are welcome
We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
25/01/24, 10:58 am - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

26/01/24, 1:56 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Excellent Mr Stanley, so now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which Chikomborero would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would Chikomborero be pursuing his higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
26/01/24, 4:04 pm - +263 71 518 5956: 1.B.A  economics. 
2.India
3. 2400us
4.2200us
5.350us
6.30days 
7.yes
26/01/24, 4:04 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Mr Stanley in question 3, I asked

Without any scholarship what is the cost of education in India for an international student?
26/01/24, 4:15 pm - +263 71 518 5956: Ok sorry, it's 4400
26/01/24, 4:18 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Yes and in question 6, I asked, if Chikomborero's application is found eligible. In how many days would you have to complete the first part of the enrollment fee?
26/01/24, 4:20 pm - +263 71 518 5956: 1week
26/01/24, 4:22 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: That's right Mr Stanley, so now a video call would be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Chikomborero's application. 

Shall I get you the slots for tomorrow?
26/01/24, 4:22 pm - +263 71 518 5956: Hi Sir,   enrollment fee and registration fee bit confusing me sorry for that.
26/01/24, 4:23 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Let me help you have a bettter understanding Mr Stanley!
26/01/24, 4:23 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
26/01/24, 4:23 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Referring to this image let me re-explain the financial aspect of the program in 3 parts.

1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc.

2. The Registration fee would be between $500-$750, basically if you recall I did brief you after your university interaction with multiple universities, you would have to reserve your seat in 1 particular university you would have to pay a registration fee. Now usually Registration fee for a student is a separate expense altogether, however for an Edoofian it is considered a part of the first year's annual fee.

Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-2025 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-2026.

3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include *Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee* However if a student is able to clear the Eligibility Check test and Interview with over 90 marks, a student is eligible to get a 90% to 100% scholarship where the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$1250-$1500*, which would include *Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee*
26/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 71 518 5956: Ok Sir
26/01/24, 4:28 pm - +263 71 518 5956: Understood

31/01/24, 5:18 pm - +263 71 518 5956: No problem Sir
31/01/24, 6:26 pm - Kunal: Good evening

31/01/24, 6:30 pm - +263 71 518 5956: Yes Sir
31/01/24, 6:33 pm - Kunal: Great, I hope you now have a better insight on the Edoofa Scholarship Program through the experiences of *Valerie*.
31/01/24, 6:34 pm - Kunal: Are you clear with the Modes of paying the enrollment fee?
31/01/24, 6:37 pm - +263 71 518 5956: Yes Sir
31/01/24, 6:42 pm - Kunal: Alright Mr Stanley
You must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
31/01/24, 7:00 pm - +263 71 518 5956: Let me find out from Mr Anodiwa the best mode
31/01/24, 7:04 pm - Kunal: That is fine, Mr Stanley
Let me know which mode do you wish me to explain
31/01/24, 7:05 pm - Kunal: *Get ready to witness the heartwarming testimonials of our proud Edoofians!* They're glad to share their remarkable journey, filled with excitement, joy, invaluable learnings, and unforgettable experiences in India. While you aspire to join this amazing family of achievers. Take a moment to listen to these inspiring stories that our Edoofian seniors have for their juniors. Their tales will undoubtedly ignite your curiosity and motivate the learners to embark on a transformative journey of their own.

31/01/24, 7:05 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 7:38 pm - +263 71 518 5956: Option 2
31/01/24, 7:40 pm - Kunal: Mr Stanley
Basically, you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student range between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
31/01/24, 7:40 pm - Kunal: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

As the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee approaches on February 6th, I'd like to inquire about your confidence in meeting this financial commitment. Are you assured of your ability to raise the required $200 by the specified date?
03/02/24, 10:18 am - +263 71 518 5956: Let me put effort Sir

06/02/24, 4:39 pm - +263 71 518 5956: Sure i know,. Sorry for that. My challenges can not be easily solved earlier, I am still paying fees for other children, I have breakdowns of my machines at my mining company and I have to repair them, I needs some petty cash to continue running the company to a productive state, I needs cash to put food on the table for the family and pay rates.  so things are not working well for me right now.
