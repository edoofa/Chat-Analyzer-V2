What got me interested in this program is the fact that they do not only focus on privileged students but they also look out for those in special need which is something I really appreciate a lot because most people in the world face different obstacles but those obstacles shouldn't be a barrier for then to receive education so since edoofa is also offering an opportunity to those type of people it got me interested and helping is one quality I envy a lot and being in an environment where I can offer my help is something I would love that's why I got interested

07/02/24, 1:48 pm - Kunal: May I know why did you get low grade in Computer Science?
07/02/24, 1:52 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: It was a challenging subject for me especially the programming part and since I started computer science in L6 and U6 I had to also catch up with the form 4 and form 3 lessons so it was a bit hectic. In L6 I  was actually upgraded for Computer science but I really made some process in U6 and I'm very proud of myself

07/02/24, 1:57 pm - Kunal: I have also noted that you are well motivated towards this career path in Business technology management and looking forward to excelling in it

What motivated you towards this career goal?
07/02/24, 2:05 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: To be honest I enjoy the career a lot because it's a combination of Technology and Business which simply means creating to me and as I mentioned before I enjoy creating and I believe that I'm a creative person.  I don't want to settle on what people have created to solve problems and only focus on that but rather go the extra mile and try and create my own solutions to solving problems and I believe that this two
 subjects combined are what will really help me with my idea on the other hand it will also help me to work hand in hand with people and help them out by finding solutions to their problems so I call myself a solution provider however I'm still researching on what exactly my calling is because I do not want to waste time on something I'm not supposed to be doing so during this A break I will definitely find out what my calling is and it will definitely be linked to helping people and once I do I might change my career goal or not but as for now I will stick with that .
07/02/24, 2:11 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: And I forgot to mention the aspect of discovering new things which really inspires me a lot and in technology you do discover a lot from computers and etc.. and in business you do discover a lot from your competitors and from your clients etc..
07/02/24, 2:40 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing, Emmanuella
May I know if you are basically inclined towards Business or in the field of Technology?
07/02/24, 2:44 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: More included to business but with a little bit of technology
07/02/24, 2:45 pm - Kunal: Alright Emmanuella

Secondly I will be able to learn how different business work in India and most probably compare with other business and try and manage the company or organization that I will be working in and not just settling to one culture or one way of doing stuffs because we have to be diverse as a company and try and include different people around the world that's how I aim to achieve my career aspirations from studying in India
08/02/24, 11:31 am - +257 71 34 27 05: And i also so that India combinés theoretical ans practical knowledge which is something very positive for me because I feel like business is more of a practical subject that a theoretical subject so I will be able to learn more from the practical side of it in terms of how business deal with their rivals,  how they creat their unique selling points, how they creat their core products and core competencies and how the structure of the organization is
08/02/24, 11:33 am - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
08/02/24, 11:47 am - +257 71 34 27 05: Sorry I'm not so familiar with that 
May I please have some information on that ??
08/02/24, 11:51 am - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/02/24, 11:51 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 11:51 am - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
08/02/24, 12:01 pm - +243 975 566 175: Thanks lit for the discussion so far
I am Mr Nzanzo,  Wmmanuel's Father.
If I got you well, the Edoofa scholarship is consisting in t3ducing the cost of Higher Education from $8000 to $ 3000 per year? If you make clear
08/02/24, 12:17 pm - Kunal: That is right
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
08/02/24, 12:19 pm - +243 975 566 175: Please tell us more of it
08/02/24, 12:20 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/02/24, 12:20 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

08/02/24, 12:20 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 12:24 pm - +243 975 566 175: It good but young student 18 years whi need to spend 3-5 years at university need maximum of focus to the student.  Looking to an Earning together with study will it not be a didiving attention?
08/02/24, 12:25 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule. 

Meanwhile you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

08/02/24, 1:40 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon
Shall we proceed?
08/02/24, 1:49 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: Yes we can
08/02/24, 1:50 pm - Kunal: I can understand your concerns about Emmanuella, facing the pressure of studying and working simultaneously. It's natural to want the best possible environment for their education. However, I'd like to emphasize that the "Earn While You Learn" program, like the one offered by Edoofa, is designed to strike a balance between work and study, ultimately benefiting the student in several ways:

Financial Support: The program provides an opportunity for students to earn a portion of their tuition fees through part-time work, reducing the financial burden on their families. This can alleviate some of the financial pressures associated with education.

Practical Experience: Part-time work allows students to gain practical work experience while pursuing their studies. This can be a valuable addition to their resume and prepare them for future career opportunities.

Time Management Skills: Balancing work and study teaches students valuable time management skills, helping them become more organized and efficient in managing their responsibilities.

Independence and Responsibility: The experience of earning while learning can foster independence and a sense of responsibility in students, as they learn to manage their finances and make informed decisions.
08/02/24, 1:50 pm - Kunal: It's important to note that the work component in programs like this is typically structured to be manageable, so it doesn't overwhelm students or interfere with their studies. Additionally, Edoofa is committed to providing the necessary support and guidance to ensure that students can successfully balance work and academics.
08/02/24, 1:50 pm - Kunal: If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
08/02/24, 1:50 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:06 pm - +243 975 566 175: Good now I got the picture of it all.
08/02/24, 2:18 pm - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
08/02/24, 2:43 pm - +243 975 566 175: Yes it is,
08/02/24, 2:44 pm - +243 975 566 175: On my side as parent see it but the appreciation of the student who will involve in the program matters.
08/02/24, 2:48 pm - Kunal: Indeed Mr Gutsave
08/02/24, 2:48 pm - Kunal: Can you address this
08/02/24, 2:51 pm - +243 975 566 175: This 4 are facts that makes me confident and convict that student  be properly prepare for future business.
08/02/24, 2:53 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program very well
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

08/02/24, 2:54 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Emmanuella with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
08/02/24, 2:57 pm - +243 975 566 175: This message was deleted
08/02/24, 2:58 pm - +243 975 566 175: As parents we will think and plan how it can be work out
08/02/24, 3:20 pm - Kunal: That is understandable
I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
08/02/24, 3:26 pm - +243 975 566 175: I am happy for and can invest for her Eduvation without fear, she as a servant Leader hear and mind
08/02/24, 3:29 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
08/02/24, 3:29 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
08/02/24, 4:19 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: As for me I do not know any
08/02/24, 4:19 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand
 When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
08/02/24, 4:19 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 4:22 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: Yes please do
08/02/24, 4:23 pm - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
08/02/24, 4:23 pm - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
08/02/24, 4:31 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: Sorry I didn't quite understand what it takes for me to be an edoofian , you talked about an application online so basically I should go on your website and apply then wait to get accepted or not is that it ??
08/02/24, 4:36 pm - Kunal: Allow me to clarify the upcoming steps in the process. Following this session, you'll proceed to the eligibility procedures, which must be successfully cleared to continue. Upon meeting the program's eligibility criteria, you'll receive an official acceptance letter from the Board. It's only after receiving this letter that you'll be required to pay the enrollment fee. This fee covers a comprehensive range of services, including:

*Application forms tailored to multiple universities, meticulously prepared by our Academic Team.*
*Professionally crafted Statement of Purpose for submission to multiple universities.*
*Participation in the Earn While You Learn Program, along with necessary training.*
*Inclusion in university sessions and subsequent selection processes.*
*Assurance of a scholarship seat reserved exclusively for you.*
*Assistance with visa documentation to facilitate your study journey.*
*Continuous support and guidance throughout your tenure as an Edoofian.*

Rest assured, each aspect is designed to maximize your academic and personal growth, ensuring a smooth transition into your chosen educational path.
08/02/24, 4:44 pm - Kunal: Are you clear?
08/02/24, 4:46 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: Much more better 
How do we go about the eligibility procedure??
08/02/24, 4:46 pm - Kunal: I will be guiding about the same in the next stage
08/02/24, 4:46 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 5:34 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: I think we have only done the 1st stage
08/02/24, 5:37 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
08/02/24, 5:38 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: Yes please
08/02/24, 5:39 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
08/02/24, 5:39 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
08/02/24, 5:41 pm - +257 71 34 27 05: Yeah the process is very clear
09/02/24, 6:25 am - Kunal: Alright Emmanuella
We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
09/02/24, 6:25 am - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage and evaluation of our Admissions team, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.
09/02/24, 1:05 pm - Kunal: 7) *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600
