Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
05/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 265 8474: Yes it is my objective to get all the 15points

07/02/24, 12:09 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
07/02/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 265 8474: Okay,I understand but can you say $2000 to $3000 is cheap
07/02/24, 12:28 pm - +263 78 265 8474: Yeah i am intrigued to study in India,I would like to study in India because after that i would be rich and able to look after my family and also my relatives.I have seen some of the richest women in the whole world and some billionnares who have background in India,so i would aim higher for me to study in India
07/02/24, 12:29 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
07/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 78 265 8474: No,can you tell me
07/02/24, 12:30 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/02/24, 12:30 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 12:30 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
07/02/24, 12:31 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 265 8474: Okay okay i understand,i thought after $2000 to $3000,you also pay for food accomodation and some
07/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 78 265 8474: Okay so this means i can afford to pay this myself through earn while you learn programme
07/02/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 265 8474: Can you explain deeper the jobs which you will earn money whiles learning
07/02/24, 12:41 pm - +263 78 265 8474: The types of jobs and how you will be working
07/02/24, 1:38 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon
Shall we proceed?
07/02/24, 1:38 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
07/02/24, 1:38 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

07/02/24, 2:45 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
07/02/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 910 8845: She's off-line I think she's busy in class
07/02/24, 3:30 pm - Kunal: I understand
In the meantime, can you take part?
07/02/24, 7:50 pm - +263 78 265 8474: Yes i think so
07/02/24, 7:50 pm - +263 78 265 8474: It is a good programme
07/02/24, 7:50 pm - +263 78 265 8474: Sorry i was busy
08/02/24, 10:04 am - Kunal: Good morning to you all
How are you doing?
08/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 78 265 8474: Morning sir,i am good
08/02/24, 10:59 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
08/02/24, 10:59 am - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
08/02/24, 10:59 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 265 8474: Yes yes,i understand it is a good programme
08/02/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 265 8474: Wooow
08/02/24, 11:17 am - Kunal: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
08/02/24, 11:22 am - +263 78 265 8474: Higher education Concierge
08/02/24, 11:22 am - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education, services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

08/02/24, 11:22 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
08/02/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 265 8474: Woow this is great,this programme is important because it helps my family by reducing my fee
08/02/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 265 8474: My parents
08/02/24, 11:28 am - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
08/02/24, 11:30 am - +263 78 265 8474: Okay,they feel comfortable and interested because i am the first one about to learn in India where there is high education and also having a scholarship in our family
08/02/24, 11:31 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
08/02/24, 11:31 am - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
08/02/24, 11:35 am - +263 78 265 8474: Umnn i think these you have mentioned
08/02/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
08/02/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 11:42 am - +263 78 265 8474: Yes please
08/02/24, 11:43 am - Kunal: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
08/02/24, 11:43 am - Kunal: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
08/02/24, 11:43 am - Kunal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
08/02/24, 11:49 am - +263 78 265 8474: Okay i understand
08/02/24, 11:51 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 78 265 8474: Stage 01
08/02/24, 11:53 am - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
08/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 265 8474: Yes,you can explain
08/02/24, 11:55 am - Kunal: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
08/02/24, 11:55 am - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
08/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 265 8474: Yes of course
08/02/24, 12:16 pm - Kunal: Alright Appreciate

08/02/24, 4:44 pm - Kunal: It was a pleasure to host the session with you today!

I am contented with your responses and performance so far as a result, let me promote your application to Stage 2 of the Edoofa Cycle. Congratulations!!👏🏼👏🏼.
Your next session is scheduled at *11:00 am CAT Tomorrow (09/02/2024)*, and I will evaluate your application and guide you through the most important *Eligibility Check* after addressing your questions.

Make sure to be available on time after having a detailed discussion with your family and *it is strongly recommended for parents/guardians of the applicant to be online for the next session as higher education is a family decision.*


Happy Family Discussion
Stay Blessed!
09/02/24, 11:18 am - Kunal: Greetings to you all

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
09/02/24, 1:01 pm - +263 77 309 0561: Yes am ready
09/02/24, 1:03 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you

I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please? <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 309 0561: Oh yes. Edoofa scholarship program seems to be very beneficial and helpful to our daughter's aspirations and dream
09/02/24, 1:09 pm - +263 77 309 0561: We hope to see the program giving us affordable education even from us the less privileged parents from non income guardians
09/02/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 309 0561: My question is, what will happen after paying some money and then we default before the end of the scholarship program
09/02/24, 1:38 pm - Kunal: I am glad you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
09/02/24, 1:38 pm - Kunal: Can you elaborate bit more on this?
09/02/24, 1:50 pm - +263 77 309 0561: I mean if we fail to complete funding the full payments  for the whole program after paying for other semesters will my child stop attending lessons.
09/02/24, 2:06 pm - Kunal: No please
In the cases where the family is having challenges in paying the fee, they can request for an extension from the university itself
09/02/24, 2:58 pm - +263 77 309 0561: Thank you
09/02/24, 2:59 pm - Kunal: Is there anything you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
09/02/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 309 0561: Will you assist my daughter in securing a job after the program
09/02/24, 3:01 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that Edoofa doesn’t offer jobs directly to students as of now. We are preparing students throughout the course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and get transformed into employable and professional citizens of the era!
They will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills. 

 Once they complete they are already having hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally
09/02/24, 3:10 pm - +263 77 309 0561: Okay one more question please
If the one paying fees happen to die before completion  of the scholarship what happens
09/02/24, 3:53 pm - +263 77 309 0561: I mean will it be the end of the road for my daughter s education or the edoofa scholarship will assist her to finish
Will she be allowed to access loans and pay later after school
09/02/24, 4:56 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 5:21 pm - +263 77 309 0561: Thanks for the time. There is no problem with time tomorrow
