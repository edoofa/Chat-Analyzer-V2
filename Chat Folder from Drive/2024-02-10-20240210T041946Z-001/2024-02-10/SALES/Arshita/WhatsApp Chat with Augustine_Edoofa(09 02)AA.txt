What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

I learnt that it's possible to get a good scholarship from edoofa, through interacting with the officials on a more personal level . 

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?

I am a strong willed individual with the dream  of being a good role model for my siblings , being the firstborn in a family of 4 children myself included from an unprivileged background ,I want to show them that dreams come true  . I have a passion for science, and I'm fond of chemistry in particular, that's why I chose Metallurgical engineering as my preference. I hope to own a mining industry some day .
