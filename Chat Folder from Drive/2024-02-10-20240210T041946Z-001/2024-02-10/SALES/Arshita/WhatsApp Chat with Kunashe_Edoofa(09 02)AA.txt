If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
09/02/24, 11:51 am - Arshita: Since you are not having Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest and passion in the field there are courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help you fulfil your dreams of working in this field
