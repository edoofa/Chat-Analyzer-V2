02/02/24, 10:46 am - Arshita: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
02/02/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 452 5317: Studying in India will help me to be a professional since it has the best universities in the world. Studying alongside industry experts will equip me with priceless knowledge. This, as a result, will help me to be ready to work  in the field as an attentive professional pharmacist.
02/02/24, 10:58 am - Arshita: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
02/02/24, 11:01 am - +263 78 452 5317: Not much, but I know that its very expensive  in countries like UK, Canada and USA, and most students take student loans to get a degree without a scholarship
02/02/24, 11:02 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 11:02 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 452 5317: Yes
02/02/24, 11:05 am - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
02/02/24, 11:06 am - +263 78 452 5317: No, please tell me how?
02/02/24, 11:06 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
02/02/24, 11:06 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.

02/02/24, 11:13 am - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world.

We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
02/02/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 452 5317: They are all amazing,but for me, 4 stands out

02/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 452 5317: Wow that's amazing
02/02/24, 11:22 am - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
02/02/24, 11:22 am - +263 78 452 5317: My mother and father will be helping me
02/02/24, 11:23 am - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
02/02/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 452 5317: We have discussed this, and they all feel okay about it. In fact, they are all thrilled at the idea
02/02/24, 11:25 am - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
02/02/24, 11:25 am - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
02/02/24, 11:33 am - +263 78 452 5317: No ,what else is required
02/02/24, 11:34 am - Arshita: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/02/24, 11:34 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 78 452 5317: Yes please sum up
02/02/24, 11:38 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
02/02/24, 11:38 am - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
02/02/24, 11:39 am - +263 78 452 5317: Ok
02/02/24, 11:39 am - +263 78 452 5317: No problem, that's good news
02/02/24, 11:40 am - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
02/02/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 452 5317: Ok, I understand
02/02/24, 11:42 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 78 452 5317: I believe we have discussed up to stage 5 now
02/02/24, 11:45 am - Arshita: We have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
02/02/24, 11:45 am - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
02/02/24, 11:45 am - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
02/02/24, 11:45 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
02/02/24, 11:45 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
02/02/24, 11:47 am - +263 78 452 5317: Yes, crystal clear
02/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 78 452 5317: Are we done with the session

02/02/24, 4:37 pm - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
02/02/24, 4:37 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

Are you clear about the same?
05/02/24, 11:49 am - +263 78 452 5317: Ok
05/02/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 452 5317: 1)Pharmacy 
2)India
3)$6000 - $8000
4)reduced to a minimum of $2000 to $ 3000 
5)$350.$200 in 7 days after acceptance into the program and the remaining must be paid in 30 days
05/02/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 452 5317: 6) The EWYL is a program that is meant to invest practical skills in students to make them industry ready. Its also makes graduates employable after finishing their programs. Since it's also about voluntary work, I think it builds confidence in students and exposes them to a working environment.The fact that students will be able to pay for their education brings maturity into them .Not only that but they become independent  because that's exactly what the outside world needs ,to be self reliant. It is a program that lessens the financial load on parents .
05/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 452 5317: 7)Yes I am

07/02/24, 1:04 pm - Arshita: Heartiest congratulations to you and your family, @263775152843 @263784525317   *as your application was found to be eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I have been so happy, the moment I saw you passed the eligibility check stage👏🏽👏🏽.* 

Since the results were shared over email, you are supposed to acknowledge them as well.

For your convenience, let me share the Letter of Acceptance for Ruramai over here as well so that you can go through it and let me know
07/02/24, 1:05 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 452 5317: Wow I'm so happy thank you so much
07/02/24, 1:06 pm - Arshita: Did you go through the acceptance letter?
07/02/24, 1:09 pm - +263 78 452 5317: Not yet
07/02/24, 1:09 pm - Arshita: Please go through it
07/02/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 452 5317: I went through the letter.
07/02/24, 1:31 pm - Arshita: Do you have any questions?
07/02/24, 1:31 pm - +263 78 452 5317: Yes
07/02/24, 1:32 pm - Arshita: Please ask
07/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 78 452 5317: The quantum of scholarship I will get has not been finalized yet right?
07/02/24, 1:36 pm - Arshita: I would first like you to please understand that Edoofa is not an Agent wherein we are only associated with 1 University. If that would have been the case I would have told you the exact fees during the counseling session itself, the reason I shared the annual fees in a range is that Edoofa is associated with 250+ UGC-recognized universities and that is why we are able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their *Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well*, and  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/02/24, 1:37 pm - Arshita: Now what you have is a very common question that any family member of the student has is why aren't they told of a fixed annual fee beforehand so that they could plan for the cost properly. I am sure similar might have been your concern as well, which is why I would again like to bring it to your knowledge that Edoofa is not an Agent that is only associated with 1 University. 

Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well.
07/02/24, 1:37 pm - Arshita: Now it is obvious that every university would evaluate a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the Quantum of scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student gets to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.
07/02/24, 1:37 pm - Arshita: Despite the same, as you can see it is clearly mentioned that as per your eligibility check evaluation the annual fee will be within the range of $2000 to $3000 inclusive of all the above mentioned aspect for the entire year.
07/02/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 452 5317: Ok understood
07/02/24, 1:39 pm - Arshita: Any other question?
07/02/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 452 5317: Another thing, the letter said course offered is subject to change, Does it mean I might do something else that is not pharmacy?
07/02/24, 1:41 pm - Arshita: The statement is not applicable for students who have secured their seats, this particular statement in your letter of Acceptance is indicating towards the fact that if a student upon securing their scholarship while being in their home country or in India wishes to change their course, then they would have to follow a set procedure for the same. 

Moreover this statement also signifies, for the students who apply for a particular year of intake later on. As you know, every course has a limited scholarship seats, now if a student applies at last towards their admission intake, then the Board has the right to change the course upon their eligibility check evaluation depending upon the availability of the remaining scholarship seats. 

For example, currently there are only 279 seats left for the course of Law for 2024 Academic Intake. Now once these 279 seats are reserved by the students, in that case 280th student would have to apply for another course that would be clearly mentioned in the Letter of Acceptance of the student
07/02/24, 1:42 pm - Arshita: *In no case, would the course mentioned in the Letter of Acceptance and University Offer Letter be different until and unless the student and family has requested for the same*
07/02/24, 1:44 pm - +263 78 452 5317: Ok. For now I don't have any further questions
07/02/24, 1:44 pm - Arshita: Are you clear with the modes of payment?
07/02/24, 1:45 pm - +263 78 452 5317: Yes I am
07/02/24, 1:45 pm - Arshita: Which mode will you be opting for?
07/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 452 5317: Transfer, I saw Mr Jerera's account details in the letter
07/02/24, 1:52 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
