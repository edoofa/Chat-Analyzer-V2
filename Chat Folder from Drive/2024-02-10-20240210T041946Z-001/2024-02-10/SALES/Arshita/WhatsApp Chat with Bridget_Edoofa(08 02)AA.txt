This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
