07/02/24, 9:44 am - Arshita: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
07/02/24, 2:02 pm - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 3:00 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
