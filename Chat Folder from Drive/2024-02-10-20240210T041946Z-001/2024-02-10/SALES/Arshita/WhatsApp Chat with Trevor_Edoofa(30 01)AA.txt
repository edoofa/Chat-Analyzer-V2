31/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 71 937 4141: India has a very fascinating culture and i like the fact that it has the third world best higher  education system placing me at better odds of employment
31/01/24, 10:14 am - Arshita: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
31/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 71 937 4141: Yes I believe it was around $4000
31/01/24, 10:19 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/01/24, 10:19 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 10:19 am - Arshita: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
31/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 71 937 4141: I'm not entirely sure .
I'll have to hear what they have to say
31/01/24, 10:25 am - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
31/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 71 937 4141: No I do not know how it's done
31/01/24, 10:26 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
31/01/24, 10:26 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

31/01/24, 10:31 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 937 4141: Yeah the program is really helpful
31/01/24, 10:35 am - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
31/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 71 937 4141: The third one
31/01/24, 10:42 am - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures

31/01/24, 11:39 am - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
31/01/24, 11:39 am - +263 71 937 4141: My parents
31/01/24, 11:39 am - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
31/01/24, 11:40 am - +263 71 937 4141: They want that too .....and I'll have a discussion with them
31/01/24, 11:40 am - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
31/01/24, 11:41 am - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
31/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 71 937 4141: No
31/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 71 937 4141: I don't know bout other requirements
31/01/24, 11:44 am - Arshita: When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
31/01/24, 11:44 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 71 937 4141: Why is it paid
31/01/24, 11:47 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
31/01/24, 11:47 am - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
31/01/24, 11:51 am - +263 71 937 4141: Okay
31/01/24, 11:51 am - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
31/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 937 4141: Got it
31/01/24, 11:53 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 11:57 am - Arshita: Please answer this
31/01/24, 12:27 pm - Arshita: Are we still connected @263719374141 ?
31/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 937 4141: Stage 4
31/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 937 4141: Sorry my internet was down
31/01/24, 12:55 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct!
31/01/24, 12:56 pm - Arshita: Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
31/01/24, 12:56 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
31/01/24, 12:56 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
31/01/24, 12:56 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
31/01/24, 12:56 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
31/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 71 937 4141: Yes it's clear
31/01/24, 3:59 pm - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
31/01/24, 3:59 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

I hope you are doing well
01/02/24, 10:31 am - Arshita: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
01/02/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 337 4141: I am okay
01/02/24, 11:19 am - Arshita: Please answer this
01/02/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 337 4141: Ues i followed
01/02/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 337 4141: I understood
01/02/24, 11:40 am - +263 77 337 4141: I have a question on B Comm
01/02/24, 11:41 am - Arshita: Please ask
01/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 337 4141: You had said his results makes him eligible for B Comm
01/02/24, 11:48 am - Arshita: Yes, he is eligible for it
01/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 337 4141: Ok so he is legible for which courses
01/02/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 337 4141: The Engeneering Courses?
01/02/24, 11:49 am - Arshita: No, he is eligible for commercials
01/02/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 337 4141: Oohk so he qualifies to enrol under commercials
01/02/24, 11:51 am - Arshita: Yes
01/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 337 4141: With passes in Pure Maths, Mechanical Maths , Physics and Chemistry i thought he would qualify for Engeneering courses
01/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 77 337 4141: What is his shortcoming in B Sciences
01/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 77 337 4141: Help me to understand
01/02/24, 11:53 am - Arshita: I can understand that! 

He can pursue engineering but he said that his interest lies in the field of commercials
01/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 337 4141: But with acturial science is he eligible
01/02/24, 11:54 am - Arshita: Actuarial science is a part of commercials and falls under B. Com
01/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 337 4141: Oohk , so we do not have an independent B Comm Acturial science Degree
01/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 337 4141: Is it like a module in some of the BComm programs
01/02/24, 11:58 am - Arshita: No, actuarial science has an individual exam and the subjects are the same as b com. 

So pursuing Bcom helps you prepare for it and once the child feels that he/she is prepared, they can give the exam.
01/02/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 337 4141: Ooh so to get to pursue actural science he has to pursue one of b comm degrees
01/02/24, 11:59 am - Arshita: Absolutely!
01/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Oooh im getting the sense
01/02/24, 12:00 pm - Arshita: Glad to hear that!
01/02/24, 12:01 pm - Arshita: Do you have any more questions for me?
01/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Yes
01/02/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 337 4141: He gets B Comm in 3 years right, then how many years more to firther up with Acturial science
01/02/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 337 4141: After attaining b Comm, how many more years does it take to finish the acturial Degree
01/02/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 337 4141: In other words we are saying acturial wl come as a post graduate degree
01/02/24, 12:03 pm - Arshita: He can give the exam along with Bcom
01/02/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Oohk. After passing the exam he gets which credit, degree or cerificate in Acturial y
01/02/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 337 4141: **sci
01/02/24, 12:06 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Your session has opened my mind
01/02/24, 12:06 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Which stage does he get to finalise the program that he will actually take
01/02/24, 12:07 pm - Arshita: After passing b com he will have a bachelor's degree. 

After actuarial science exam he will have a certificate
01/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 337 4141: May you also assist us with the Engeneering programs that he would qualify for
01/02/24, 12:07 pm - Arshita: The program must be finalised today
01/02/24, 12:08 pm - Arshita: Does he have any specific interest like computer science engineering, mechanical engineering, etc?
01/02/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Im far from home and his phone had no power , we are experiencing load shedding
01/02/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 337 4141: We once discussed along those lines , but i would have liked him to come with the final decision
01/02/24, 12:10 pm - Arshita: I can understand that! 

So by when can I expect a feedback?
01/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 337 4141: I think tomorrow
01/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 337 4141: He had listed
Actural science
Aerospace Engeneering
Mining Engeneering
Civil Engineering
01/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 337 4141: I wish to further discuss with him today and let him finalise then tomorrow he passes out his final decision
01/02/24, 12:16 pm - Arshita: Noted. 

Being your counselor I will guide you to go for B com as actuarial science is his first preference and   also with Bcom I might be able to push his application for a higher quantum of scholarship
01/02/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Higher quantam means what
01/02/24, 12:17 pm - Arshita: Means more scholarship percentage
01/02/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Ohk
01/02/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Higher quantam ranges to what %
01/02/24, 12:18 pm - Arshita: That will be based on final interview results
01/02/24, 12:18 pm - Arshita: This message was deleted
01/02/24, 12:18 pm - Arshita: This message was deleted

01/02/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Which Engeneering courses is he eligible for? So that when i meet him he gets to make his final decision
01/02/24, 12:22 pm - Arshita: He can do civil engineering
01/02/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Great. Ill let him know
01/02/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 337 4141: So when doing b comm , he gets to write along the acturial science at the same university? Or there are specific institutions that gives those exams
01/02/24, 12:25 pm - Arshita: That is a national exam thus he would have to apply for it online, himself
01/02/24, 12:26 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Ooh ok. Thank you
01/02/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 337 4141: And he doesn't need to finish bComm first to write the exam?
01/02/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Im very grateful for your session
01/02/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Its so enlightening
01/02/24, 12:29 pm - Arshita: No

02/02/24, 9:06 am - Arshita: Greetings! 
Hope you are doing well! 

Shall we continue our session?
02/02/24, 9:24 am - +263 71 937 4141: Morning .I'm doing well and you?
02/02/24, 9:24 am - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you!
02/02/24, 9:24 am - Arshita: Have you decided that which course you want to pursue?
02/02/24, 9:28 am - +263 71 937 4141: Yes but I had a question.......does architecture need the ACET exam too
02/02/24, 9:29 am - Arshita: Yes, it does
02/02/24, 9:29 am - +263 71 937 4141: Okay.....
02/02/24, 9:30 am - +263 71 937 4141: I have decided to go with civil engineering..
02/02/24, 9:32 am - Arshita: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
02/02/24, 9:55 am - +263 71 937 4141: It one is good
02/02/24, 9:55 am - Arshita: Noted

02/02/24, 9:57 am - +263 71 937 4141: No you pretty much covered everything.....but if l think of any I will be sure to ask
02/02/24, 9:58 am - Arshita: Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
02/02/24, 10:07 am - +263 77 337 4141: Good morning
02/02/24, 10:07 am - Arshita: Greetings! 

Hope you are doing well
02/02/24, 10:14 am - +263 71 937 4141: 1)Civil engineering
2) India
3)$6000 to $8000
4)$2000 to $3000
5)$350 in 7 days
6)the earn while you learn program helps a student by reducing the amount of tuition fees to be paid for that year through the earning of scholarship credit .. Scholarship credit can be earned through various projects and online skills such as search engine optimisation , digital marketing blog writing , content creation. The scholarship credit earned is equivalent to physical cash thus it is able to reduce the tuition fee to a very affordable amount. It also instills the online skills to the students involved in it.
7) yes im clear

05/02/24, 2:33 pm - Arshita: Thank you for waiting. 

Shall we continue?
05/02/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Yes We can
05/02/24, 2:34 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through the letter?
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Yes
05/02/24, 2:38 pm - Arshita: Do you have any questions?
05/02/24, 2:40 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Yes Maam
05/02/24, 2:41 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Letter states that reg Administration fee is $500- $1000
Is this amount part of the $2000- $3000 of tuition
05/02/24, 2:42 pm - Arshita: Yes, it is a part of it
05/02/24, 2:43 pm - +263 77 337 4141: It also states that the fee will be adjusted to $0 upon arrival
05/02/24, 2:43 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Okay
05/02/24, 2:43 pm - Arshita: Yes, because it is already a part of it so you won't have to pay it again and it will be adjusted
05/02/24, 2:44 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Question 2
It states that course offered is subject to change... Does the universities change the program without the students will
05/02/24, 2:44 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Is it the learners wish only that can change program
05/02/24, 2:45 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Who comes up with the idea to change first
05/02/24, 2:45 pm - Arshita: This message was deleted
05/02/24, 2:45 pm - Arshita: The statement is not applicable for students who have secured their seats, this particular statement in Trevor's letter of Acceptance is indicating towards the fact that if a student upon securing their scholarship while being in their home country or in India wishes to change their course, then they would have to follow a set procedure for the same. 

Moreover this statement also signifies, for the students who apply for a particular year of intake later on. As you know, every course has a limited scholarship seats, now if a student applies at last towards their admission intake, then the Board has the right to change the course upon their eligibility check evaluation depending upon the availability of the remaining scholarship seats. 

For example, currently there are only 279 seats left for the course of Law for 2024 Academic Intake. Now once these 279 seats are reserved by the students, in that case 280th student would have to apply for another course that would be clearly mentioned in the Letter of Acceptance of the student
05/02/24, 2:46 pm - Arshita: *In no case, would the course mentioned in the Letter of Acceptance and University Offer Letter be different until and unless the student and family has requested for the same*
05/02/24, 2:47 pm - +263 77 337 4141: I understand
05/02/24, 2:48 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Question 3
It states that the EWYL program commences after the payment of $200US....
05/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Does the EWYL have sort of training first or its automatic
05/02/24, 2:50 pm - Arshita: Yes, once you pay the enrollment amount, you will be added to the admissions group and also you will be allotted your EWYL mentors and your EWYL journey will begin.
05/02/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Ok Maam, its clear.
05/02/24, 2:51 pm - Arshita: Our mentors will be guiding Trevor through each step and proper guidance will be given to him
05/02/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Okay
05/02/24, 2:52 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Then the payment of the $350 from here, how is the procesure done if we may want to send it direct to your EDEOOFA account
05/02/24, 2:54 pm - Arshita: Sure, talking about the first mode, which is the Direct Bank transfer in our Account, basically because of the cash crisis in Zimbabwe, there are a limited Banks which allow International Transfer. These Banks are Barclays Bank and CBZ Bank, Nedbank and FBC Bank. If you have an account in any of these Banks then the transaction charges will then be $100 to $120 USD for any amount upto $1000 depending upon the bank. Please note that $350 should also be in USD. In case you have Zimbabwean Dollars, you will have to exchange that with USD and transfer charges on *every transaction* would also be $100 to $120.

Therefore, the Bank Details that are to be used in this mode are:

Swift code: AXISINBB207
IFSC code: UTIB0001147
Bank Name: Axis Bank Ltd.
Account Name: Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
Current Account Number: 917020070183626
Bank's Name:  Axis Bank Ltd.
Bank’s Address: Janakpuri, B Block, New Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058
05/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 77 337 4141: So the direct payment does it necessarily have to be specifically from the parents account, or anyone with CBZ account can transfer on our behalf
05/02/24, 2:58 pm - Arshita: Anyone can transfer it. 

You have to share the picture of the receipt in the group
05/02/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Okay
05/02/24, 3:05 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Concerning the letter i do not have more questions
05/02/24, 3:05 pm - +263 77 337 4141: It states about assistance in visa etc
05/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Can you enlighten us on visa payment, flight payments,
05/02/24, 3:08 pm - Arshita: The visa and the flight payments are to be managed by you. 

Our admissions team will definitely provide you assistance in that
05/02/24, 3:10 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Okay. We wanted light so that we budget accordingly
05/02/24, 3:10 pm - +263 77 337 4141: How much is the visa payment
05/02/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 337 4141: The $350 US , it it part of the $500 -$1000 Administration fee
05/02/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Or is the initial payment of $350 independent from the $500- $1000
05/02/24, 3:13 pm - Arshita: It is independent
05/02/24, 3:13 pm - Arshita: Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 
This cost can be further reduced by an Edoofian through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
05/02/24, 3:13 pm - Arshita: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from the University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family
05/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Okay $500-$1000 is paid accordingly to the destination university
05/02/24, 3:16 pm - Arshita: Yes
05/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Its clear now.
05/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Then supposed Trevor pays $600 instead of the $2200, the $1600 should be paid when
05/02/24, 3:18 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Does he pay upon arrival in India
05/02/24, 3:18 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Or he mist be fully paid upon arrival
05/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Do you have the breakdown of visa application fees
05/02/24, 3:23 pm - Arshita: It is just an example
05/02/24, 3:23 pm - Arshita: It may vary a bit depending upon university to university
05/02/24, 3:23 pm - +263 77 337 4141: Yes , im using the example too to ask my question
