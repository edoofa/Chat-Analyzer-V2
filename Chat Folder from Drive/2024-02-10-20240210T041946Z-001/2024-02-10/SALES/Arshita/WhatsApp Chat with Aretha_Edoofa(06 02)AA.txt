07/02/24, 11:47 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
07/02/24, 11:47 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 11:47 am - Arshita: Let me know once you are done.
07/02/24, 12:10 pm - +27 84 796 1447: Am done
07/02/24, 12:12 pm - Arshita: With your interest in engineering why didn't you opt for science in O level?
07/02/24, 12:14 pm - +27 84 796 1447: I did but did not pass it
07/02/24, 12:14 pm - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
07/02/24, 12:15 pm - Arshita: Since you are not having science you are not eligible for engineering. 

At the same time do you have any alternate career aspirations?
07/02/24, 12:21 pm - +27 84 796 1447: Yes like to do Arts
07/02/24, 12:22 pm - Arshita: Anything in particular ?
