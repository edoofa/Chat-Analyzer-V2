What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?:I am a very intelligent student who desires to pursue further his education.I want to support my family because of lack of employment I am failing to find a job in order to help them,I know they cannot afford to further support my studies financially as I am blessed with lots of siblings behind me who also are trying to get educated so instead I chose to seek help when I heard about Edoofa Scholarship Program so to further pursue my education which I cannot afford same as my parents.Adding on I have also learned that Edoofa Scholarship program is the best for me because as a student l can learn,work and earn at the same time .Moreover Edoofa stays with the student throughout their academic courses mentoring them to be job ready and self efficient in today life. I look forward in getting a scholarship from Edoofa Scholarship program. Yours faithfully
