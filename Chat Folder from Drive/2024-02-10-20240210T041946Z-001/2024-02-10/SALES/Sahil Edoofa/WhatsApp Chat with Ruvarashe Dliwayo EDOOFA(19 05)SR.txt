09/02/24, 10:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Greetings *Ruvarashe Dliwayo*, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am Mr Sahil - Senior Academician

Today while I was organising my day, I was going through our records, and I came across your scholarship application and noticed that you were one of the dedicated students who was so keen on pursuing your education abroad. However, because of some situations beyond your control, you were not able to turn your dream into a reality and since then we lost touch with each other.

Hence, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out personally and just check in with you and your family. How have you been doing? Were you able to start your higher education by now, or are you still exploring better opportunities?
