01/02/24, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India.
01/02/24, 3:54 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Definitely. I'd be happy to associate with Indian experts as well as getting good mentorship from them.With the given amazing facts i feel inspired and movited to study in India
01/02/24, 3:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
01/02/24, 4:03 pm - +263 73 242 2020: I've noticed that the fees ranges from about $3000 to $7000  per year, without a scholarship. But given the financial situation of my parents, they will not be able to afford it
01/02/24, 4:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/02/24, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
01/02/24, 4:14 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes I do. My parents would really appreciate the reduction in the cost of education. After consulting them, they assured that they would sacrifice to ensure that I get quality education provided for me.
01/02/24, 4:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear! Your parents' willingness to make sacrifices to ensure you receive a quality education is truly admirable. We understand the importance of reducing the cost of education and are committed to providing affordable options without compromising on quality.
01/02/24, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
01/02/24, 4:20 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes please
01/02/24, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
01/02/24, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
01/02/24, 4:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
01/02/24, 4:34 pm - +263 73 242 2020: The earn while you learn program will definitely add value to my resume to take up better jobs in the future. I will definitely benefit a lot from the earn while you learn program as it allows me to gain work experience and relevant skills while still in school.
01/02/24, 4:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 4:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
01/02/24, 4:38 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes I do. Thank you for expanding and shedding more light on how the EWYL program works
01/02/24, 4:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now as we proceed towards the end of the session, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
01/02/24, 4:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
02/02/24, 9:43 am - +263 73 242 2020: Greetings,
We are good to begin
02/02/24, 9:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well too
02/02/24, 9:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, as per our previous session, we are about to proceed to Stage 2 and for that I would like you to actively respond for the next 20-25 minutes!
02/02/24, 9:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this too
02/02/24, 9:56 am - +263 73 242 2020: All of the facts stand out for me .I believe that they are each significant as they each complement each other in one way or the other.
02/02/24, 9:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you have grabbed the whole program very well
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

02/02/24, 9:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
02/02/24, 10:08 am - +263 73 242 2020: My parents will be trying their utmost best to provide and help with the remaining fee.However, in the event that something happens to my parents, the extended family will be ready to chip in. <This message was edited>
02/02/24, 10:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
02/02/24, 10:26 am - +263 73 242 2020: My family would be proud if I got the opportunity to study abroad. They are willing to sacrifice so that such an opportunity can be provided to me. Getting a scholarship will help us financially and remove the financial burden that comes with sending a child to school abroad
02/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 242 2162: We would really love her to study abroad and get quality education as you clearly indicated
02/02/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tariro, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
02/02/24, 10:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
02/02/24, 10:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am really glad to hear that!
02/02/24, 11:07 am - +263 73 242 2020: No, I don't know of any other requirements
02/02/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 242 2162: Noted. Will assist her to have the highlighted requirements
02/02/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 242 2162: How do we access the online application form and or the offline one
02/02/24, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that regarding the online application form our admissions team will be helping and guiding you!
02/02/24, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Note that When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/02/24, 11:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 242 2162: You're welcome to provide the information and guidance
02/02/24, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
02/02/24, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that *why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
02/02/24, 11:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
02/02/24, 11:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
02/02/24, 9:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 9:17 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Thank you
03/02/24, 3:12 am - +263 77 242 2162: Well noted. We have understood how and when the application fee is paid and the payment terms available.

We are however now waiting for the assistance on drafting the statement of purpose and other requirements highlighted
03/02/24, 10:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
03/02/24, 11:06 am - +263 73 242 2020: Yes indeed, Good morning
03/02/24, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Tariro?
03/02/24, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: @263772422162 Dear Parent, That is surely noted and you need not to worry as our Admissions team will be guiding you for the wholw process.
03/02/24, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 11:18 am - +263 73 242 2020: I'm good how are you
03/02/24, 11:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well
03/02/24, 11:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this
03/02/24, 11:39 am - +263 73 242 2020: I think we're now on the second stage
03/02/24, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Taririo,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
03/02/24, 2:20 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes please
03/02/24, 10:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/02/24, 1:13 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Good afternoon. I am ready
05/02/24, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
05/02/24, 1:31 pm - +263 73 242 2020: I'm good thanks how are you
05/02/24, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that are clear upto this please!
05/02/24, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am so glad to know that!
05/02/24, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well, Thank you for asking!
05/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes we are. The video clarified other things too
05/02/24, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
05/02/24, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
05/02/24, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
05/02/24, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through these remaining steps once
05/02/24, 1:37 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Noted. I've understood the process.
05/02/24, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do, you have any queries?
05/02/24, 1:46 pm - +263 73 242 2020: No I don't
05/02/24, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
05/02/24, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tariro,  we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
06/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes I am. Good afternoon
06/02/24, 12:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Tariro,
I hope you are doing well
06/02/24, 12:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
06/02/24, 12:19 pm - +263 73 242 2020: Yes we did
06/02/24, 12:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
06/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 73 242 2020: My parents and I think that that the Edoofa scholarship program is a reliable program that could assist me with getting a place at a reliable and trustworthy University in India.  On of the major advantages of this program is the EWYL program that will enable me to assist my parents in paying for my tuition fees. The Edoofa scholarship program also acts as financial aid to my parents and it also provides guidance on the best program to choose. The chances of me getting a job after completing my program are also high.
06/02/24, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
06/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 242 2162: How long does it take for eligibility test stage to complete
06/02/24, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session today, Ms. Muwanikwa,
I hope that you are doing well today
06/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 77 242 2162: Am doing well.
06/02/24, 12:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that as soon as we answer your queries and everything, the interview and the eligibility check test will be scheduled!
06/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 242 2162: OK noted
06/02/24, 12:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Ms. Muwanika!
06/02/24, 12:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
06/02/24, 12:40 pm - +263 77 242 2162: With payment terms highlighted, it seems affordable and reasonable. Enrollment fees forms part of the annual cost of education fees due, it makes everything more affordable with the time frame given.
06/02/24, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that also, I appreciate your willingness to invest in your child’s career
06/02/24, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tariro, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
06/02/24, 1:07 pm - +263 73 242 2020: 1. I will be studying B. Tech Computer science and engineering

2. I will be studying in India

3. The average cost of studies in India without a scholarship ranges from $6000 to $8000

4. If found eligible for the program, I will be required to pay $2000 to $3000 per annum

5. The enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program is about $350and it is paid within 7 days if found eligible.

6.The EWYL program is a program that allows students to work while studying. As the students work, they earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their tuition fees. These credits are equivalent to physical cash. Students are given online projects during which they gain work experience. This program helps students to learn and develop necessary skills for the digital workspace environment. It also helps in the growth of the student and helps them to keep up with the ever changing market strategies.

Furthermore, the Edoofa Program alsohepls students to find jobs after completion of their courses through the EWYL program. Students are placed in fields that they have already worked and experienced through the EWYL program.

7. I am very clear about the same.
06/02/24, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well done, Tariro!
06/02/24, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263772422162 @263715840199 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
06/02/24, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
06/02/24, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*

06/02/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/02/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/02/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
06/02/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 2:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally @263772422162 @263715840199 , the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th of February 2024 for $200 and the 1st or 2nd of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the the 13th or 14th of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
06/02/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 242 2162: We would opt for option 1(one) which will give us 7 days to pay the balance of 150
06/02/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for the acknowledgement, dear parent!
