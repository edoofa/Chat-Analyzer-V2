21/11/23, 4:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Egness, Before finalizing a course I would like to know why Tawanda's grades are low?
21/11/23, 5:04 pm - +27 84 450 0248: Lack of resources most on L5 and we were experiencing some challenge for the past 2years l think that's what affected him, but we ok now . He's  a hard working boy
21/11/23, 6:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Egness, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*


Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
21/11/23, 9:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!!

22/11/23, 9:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hello Tawanda, I hope you are doing well.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
23/11/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin the session?
23/11/23, 8:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Tawanda, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Friday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
29/01/24, 2:38 pm - +263 78 855 7013: Yes l do thus why am so excited and greatfull for being granted such an opportunity with Aldoofa
29/01/24, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know how much will it be?
29/01/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 855 7013: I have also understanding that higher education is 6000 to 8000 USD per year
29/01/24, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/01/24, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 3:01 pm - +27 84 450 0248: Greetings too Ms Pallika
29/01/24, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
29/01/24, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Ms. Egness,
How have you been?
29/01/24, 3:04 pm - +27 84 450 0248: Doing well thanks and you ?
Thanks for the opportunity
29/01/24, 3:05 pm - +263 78 855 7013: Yes reduced cost will be affordable
29/01/24, 3:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing well
29/01/24, 3:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
29/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 855 7013: By doing a part time while learning at the same time
29/01/24, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

29/01/24, 3:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
29/01/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 855 7013: I think l will benefit from the earn while Yu learn Program and it helps to cut costs.
29/01/24, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
29/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 855 7013: And am also willing to work hard to earn while learning
29/01/24, 3:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
29/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 78 855 7013: 2. Earn while Yu learn .
29/01/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 855 7013: But all of them are most significant
29/01/24, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

29/01/24, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/01/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 855 7013: My parents
29/01/24, 4:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 855 7013: They are encouraging me and willing to support me in every aspects .
29/01/24, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
29/01/24, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
29/01/24, 4:08 pm - +263 78 855 7013: And they are so happy thus why they  they allowed me to apply for Adoofa
29/01/24, 4:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know that too!
29/01/24, 4:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: please go through this
29/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 78 855 7013: Oky Ms Pallika
29/01/24, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright Tawanda, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
29/01/24, 4:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 78 855 7013: Thank Yu Ms for further details
29/01/24, 4:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
29/01/24, 4:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
29/01/24, 9:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 9:18 pm - +27 84 450 0248: Am so glad for being so mindful of us  parents . My apologies for late response was on duty .thank you
30/01/24, 9:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon,
I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin the session?
30/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 78 855 7013: Good morning Ms Pallika
30/01/24, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Tawanda?
30/01/24, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through the previous conversation that I had with your parents!
30/01/24, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 78 855 7013: Am ready Ms Pallika
30/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 78 855 7013: We have discussed all of them
30/01/24, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Tawanda,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
30/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 855 7013: Yes Ms Pallika
30/01/24, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
30/01/24, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
30/01/24, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
30/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 78 855 7013: It was clear Mrs , so  l have to submittee recommendation letter , then and other necessities
30/01/24, 10:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: No, Tawanda, Our Admission Team will be guiding you for the same when your admission process will start!
30/01/24, 10:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me now?
30/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 78 855 7013: Oky Ms ,

30/01/24, 11:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
30/01/24, 11:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tawanda, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
30/01/24, 11:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

31/01/24, 10:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Tawanda, and Dear Parents!

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
31/01/24, 12:24 pm - +27 84 450 0248: Greetings to Ms Pallika 

My apologies, where Tawanda is they have electricity problem  since yesterday so his fone is off.

We really appreciate for giving our son opportunity like this.
31/01/24, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
31/01/24, 12:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Ms. Egness,
I hope you are doing well
31/01/24, 12:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please? <This message was edited>
31/01/24, 1:42 pm - +27 84 450 0248: Am well thanks for asking
31/01/24, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this too
31/01/24, 2:05 pm - +27 84 450 0248: My thoughts Edoofa scholarship is a dream come true to those who will be granted the opportunity.  Looking at how you have divided the payment to me it easy my pocket to plan since he's not the only one am paying for . 

Questions ?
1 How many sessions do we have to do to finish??
2.Since the intake is in August  ,when will they leave for their studies?
3. EWYL does it not disturb the full time learning of a child?
4. The 50 -100% l will qualify include food and accommodation, so my son will just bring nothing
31/01/24, 2:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Let me help you with these!
31/01/24, 2:16 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor joined using this group's invite link
31/01/24, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: 1)	Please note that following today's session, there will be an eligibility check test and interview for you and Tawanda. Our academic board will conduct the assessment, and within 1-2 days, the results regarding Tawanda's eligibility will be available. Subsequently, enrollment procedures will commence upon Tawanda's enrollment. Once enrolled, both the admission and the EWYL process will begin concurrently. <This message was edited>
31/01/24, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: 2) The intake is from August – September -2024, they will be leaving before August.
31/01/24, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: 3) Please note that the EWYL projects are online. In India, international student isn't permitted to do part-time to ensure they focus on education completely. The same is ensured in the Earn While You Learn Program. Just imagine, you having a physical job. You have to travel from your residence and prepare your routine accordingly which would affect your study hours, especially during exams. Now, the Earn While You Lear Program offers projects that are online which you can perform at your residence itself with flexibility in working hours which allows a complete balance between the program and education!

31/01/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 855 7013: Thank Yu Ms
31/01/24, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well done, Tawanda!
31/01/24, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @27844500248 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
31/01/24, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
31/01/24, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*


Please address this using voice notes!
31/01/24, 4:12 pm - +27 84 450 0248: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
31/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
31/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
31/01/24, 4:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 9th or 10th of February 2024 for $200 and the 9th or 10th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 9th or 10th of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
31/01/24, 4:27 pm - +27 84 450 0248: I  opt  for the 1st one, but why such a short notice if l may ask?
31/01/24, 4:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Egness, Please note that this enrollment fee is for reserving a seat for your child as I do appreciate your understanding of the current circumstances with the large number of applicants and the restricted number of scholarship slots, particularly during this time when the A-level results are being announced. Given the significance of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the volume of applications we are presently receiving. 

Also, please note that the intake of Tawanda is 2024, and if Tawanda is found eligible, she will be coming in the month of August-September 2024, for that Admission and EWYL Process will also be started and they will start once Tawanda gets enrolled.

“Building and defending the family of God.”

*MAKE THE BEST USE OF EVERY MOMENT*

Proverbs 12:24 The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be put to forced labor. 

How do diligent people find freedom in their work? When you carefully order your priorities and intentionally build your schedule around them, you will experience freedom rather than oppression. Even people with heavy loads and busy schedules can experience freedom with diligent planning. 

Proverbs 12:27 Whoever is slothful will not roast his game, but the diligent man will get precious wealth.

If you are diligent, you’ll make the best use of every moment in your day. Daily schedule quality time to meditate on God’s Word and praying effectively as this helps you to have spiritual precision. 

We invite you to a Day of Transformation (DOT) service on Sunday 4th February 2024 in all Oasis Christian Assembly branches. Be blessed as you watch this short Day of Transformation video at     https://youtu.be/GYORBQ1bU5s  

You will receive all the answers, impartations and graces that you need without delay in Jesus name, amen.   Invite and bring others with you to this service. It is your time for upgrade, elevation, take off to ensure that 2024 will be the best year yet of your life, in Jesus name, amen.

God bless you.

05/02/24, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Tawanda, and Ms. Egness,
How are you all doing today?
05/02/24, 10:06 am - +27 84 450 0248: Good day too Ms Pallika ,we doing well thanks and you  ?Tawanda is having problem with electricity since Friday his off is off
05/02/24, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is alright, Ms. Egness, i understand!
05/02/24, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you all have discussed the Letter of Acceptance thoroughly by now. May I know if there is anything you would like to ask as of now please?
05/02/24, 11:58 am - +27 84 450 0248: Yes we did thanks for asking.?
Tawanda fees per annum is 1200- 1800 usd right..??
05/02/24, 11:59 am - +27 84 450 0248: Is there other way to pay in South Africa?
05/02/24, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Egness,  I hope you are clear that the annual fee after scholarship would be paid after the student arrives in India please, so now shall I brief you how can one do the same?
05/02/24, 1:24 pm - +27 84 450 0248: Yes you can
05/02/24, 1:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So now let me tell you, the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
05/02/24, 2:05 pm - +27 84 450 0248: OK ooh now l understand thank you
05/02/24, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
05/02/24, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since I connected you with Mr and Mrs. Jerera, did you happen to speak with them?
05/02/24, 2:31 pm - +27 84 450 0248: Yes l did
05/02/24, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, I hope you now have a better insight on the Edoofa Scholarship Program through the experiences of *Mr. Jerera*.
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - +27 84 450 0248: Yes l do, but wish Tawanda can share his views too
05/02/24, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Ms. Egness!
05/02/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Are you clear with the modes of enrollment fee payment?
05/02/24, 2:52 pm - +27 84 450 0248: Yes l am now ,coz l was thinking l have to pay it all now before he left in August

Mrs Christina Rockson, is one of the parents who have assisted multiple parents across South Africa in completing their children's formalities. Since Mrs Rockson's son is in India, she has the beneficiary details added in her Mama Money Account. Therefore here is your order for the same. You can complete the same and let me know please!
08/02/24, 4:15 pm - +27 84 450 0248: I came to realization that Tawanda has to know the procedure for future's sake . So it's ok for now ,he has to go pay for himself
08/02/24, 4:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Understood. It's important for Tawanda to learn the procedure for future reference. For now, it's perfectly fine for him to take responsibility and pay for himself.
