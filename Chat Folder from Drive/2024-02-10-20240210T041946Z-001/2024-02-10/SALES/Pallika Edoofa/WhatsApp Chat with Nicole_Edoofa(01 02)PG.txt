05/02/24, 7:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nicole, In India, the fabric of society is woven with diverse cultures, languages, and traditions, fostering an environment of unity in diversity. While there may be occasional incidents, the prevalent attitude is one of acceptance and mutual respect. India's long history of coexistence and tolerance reinforces the notion that differences are celebrated rather than used as a basis for discrimination. Overall, India strives to promote inclusivity and harmony among its people, reflecting a society that values the richness of its multicultural tapestry. <This message was edited>
05/02/24, 7:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
05/02/24, 7:35 pm - +263 78 484 8117: Thats better.Thats means l no longer have anything to fear
05/02/24, 7:35 pm - +263 78 484 8117: Mmm l have no idea

05/02/24, 7:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes Nicole!
05/02/24, 7:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Of course! Pursuing education from the best colleges in India opens up numerous job opportunities. India's dynamic economy and growing industries offer a wide range of career prospects across various sectors. With dedication and the right qualifications, you'll certainly find ample opportunities to build a fulfilling career here.
05/02/24, 7:39 pm - +263 78 484 8117: Wow  im getting more interested in studying there
05/02/24, 7:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Happy to hear that!
05/02/24, 7:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/02/24, 7:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 7:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
05/02/24, 8:09 pm - +263 78 484 8117: I think so
05/02/24, 8:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
05/02/24, 8:28 pm - +263 78 484 8117: No
05/02/24, 8:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/02/24, 8:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/02/24, 8:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
05/02/24, 8:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 8:35 pm - +263 78 484 8117: Im rarely online during the day .lm usually online at around 6am but l will try to be online at the time you mentioned
05/02/24, 8:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, In that case your parents can have the session too
05/02/24, 8:36 pm - +263 78 484 8117: I think it will be helpful to me
05/02/24, 8:36 pm - +263 78 484 8117: Ok l will inform them
05/02/24, 10:56 pm - +263 78 292 8117: I dont think l can afford it because she also has a twin brother who also wants to go to university this year
06/02/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
06/02/24, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Dear Parent!

Have you gone through the EWYL Program?
06/02/24, 10:08 am - +263 78 292 8117: Yes l did
06/02/24, 10:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Mr. Jacob, If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
06/02/24, 10:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 10:16 am - +263 78 292 8117: I now understand
06/02/24, 10:17 am - +263 78 292 8117: So what kind of work will she be doing
06/02/24, 10:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: We are still working on the employability opportunities for our students. At the same time, we are preparing Edoofians throughout their course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and practical learning so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate.
Our students will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills sought by the Industries. 

Once they complete they will already have hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally.
06/02/24, 10:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
06/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 78 292 8117: Okay
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Mr. Jacob, So, I hope that you have understood now!
06/02/24, 10:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session, Mr. Jacob and Nicole, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
06/02/24, 10:38 am - +263 78 292 8117: Higher education concierge.I wont have to worry about her because there will be people to look after her and guide her from making wrong decisions

06/02/24, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
06/02/24, 10:42 am - +263 78 292 8117: I will fund her education
06/02/24, 10:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
06/02/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 292 8117: Im the father my daughter wil be the one studying abroad

06/02/24, 10:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, Mr. Jacob, may I know May I know how you feel about your child studying abroad?
06/02/24, 10:51 am - +263 78 292 8117: It makes me happy because she will be able to fulfill her dreams and she wont be dependent on anyone in life after completing her dreams
06/02/24, 10:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Jacob, I am glad to hear that, studying Internationally would make your child’s career advance at an even greater pace, as your child will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would help in uplifting your family and provide a hassle-free life.
06/02/24, 10:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
06/02/24, 6:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 6:27 pm - +263 78 484 8117: Thank you
07/02/24, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
07/02/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 484 8117: Im ready
07/02/24, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that today is going well!
07/02/24, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are clear upto this, Let me share the further information as we are about to proceed to Stage 2
07/02/24, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: You see, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
07/02/24, 10:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 484 8117: Yes
07/02/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
07/02/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me share that *you why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
07/02/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
07/02/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
07/02/24, 9:30 pm - +263 78 292 8117: Ok i understand
07/02/24, 10:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

08/02/24, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 484 8117: Stage 1
08/02/24, 10:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!
08/02/24, 10:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
08/02/24, 10:26 am - +263 78 484 8117: Yes
08/02/24, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
08/02/24, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
08/02/24, 10:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.

08/02/24, 12:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nicole, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
08/02/24, 12:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.
