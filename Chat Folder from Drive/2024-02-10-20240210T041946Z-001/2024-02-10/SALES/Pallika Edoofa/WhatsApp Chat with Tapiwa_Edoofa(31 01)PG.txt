This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done. Let me know if there is any challenge.*

07/02/24, 12:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tapiwa, continuing the discussions, I was evaluating your subject combinations and grades with our Academic board, and according to that your are eligible to go for BDesign Graphics let me share that I have vouched for your application for a higher quantum of scholarship, but BDesign Graphics is a niche course and there are already limited seats for that even beyond the scholarship the cost of education will be high and the quantum of the scholarship is less and if you would personally ask me for the suggestion so I would suggest you that BDesign Graphics is the domain of BCA, a student like your caliber can easily get a scholarship of 80-85 %, And if you will pursue BDesign Graphics your results will be evaluated further too, so, you are no doubt eligible for BDesign Graphics but the scholarship will be between 50-60%.

Please let me know which course you would like me to share with you in-depth, *BDesign Graphics* or *BCA*
07/02/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 376 4281: What is BCA

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
09/02/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 547 1326: No
09/02/24, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/02/24, 12:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 12:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1600-$2700, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
09/02/24, 12:44 pm - +263 78 547 1326: Can l get back when l talk to mom
09/02/24, 12:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure!
09/02/24, 12:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
09/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 78 547 1326: No
09/02/24, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay as I was having my lunch.
09/02/24, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
09/02/24, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
