*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
18/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 77 365 4399: Am afraid Perkins is currently having lessons.The ideal time is during weekends
18/01/24, 1:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that I understand, since schools in Zimbabwe have reopened, students are currently engaged in lessons and exam preparations, rendering them unavailable. This situation contrasts with Western African countries where students have already received their results. Consequently, there is a high likelihood that scholarship seats could be filled by students from these regions, posing a potential disadvantage for Zimbabwean students.

These factors particularly affect boarding students and those who are restricted from using devices in school. By the time they return, the opportunity may have been taken by other applicants. To address this concern, our Academic Board, in consultation with universities, has decided to allow parents to participate in the seat reservation interview for their children. This ensures that no deserving applicant is overlooked.
18/01/24, 1:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So as of now parents do have a chance in representing their child under the evaluation process, so would it be possible for us to have a discussion regarding the same please?
18/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 365 4399: Yes we can discuss
18/01/24, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!

05/02/24, 2:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Perkins, May I know the exact concern?
05/02/24, 2:14 pm - +263 77 525 4924: My parents can't afford such huge amount
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
05/02/24, 2:47 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Yes I am looking forward for such an opportunity
05/02/24, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, will your parents willing to put a little extra effort for your career abroad!
05/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Yes
05/02/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
05/02/24, 3:05 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Ok
05/02/24, 3:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, please discuss about the same with them once again and ask if they are willing to support you financially?
05/02/24, 3:05 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Ok
05/02/24, 8:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion at *09:30 am CAT (03/02/2024)* to resume your session (In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)



*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!

As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?

08/02/24, 9:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,

I am here to begin the session today,

Shall we begin?
08/02/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Yes
08/02/24, 1:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you, Perkins?
08/02/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 525 4924: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Iam fine
08/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 525 4924: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 525 4924: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Here are the images  you wanted
08/02/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Perkins,
I am glad that you have managed that!
08/02/24, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, so, as your aspirations in engineering, May I know why haven't you opted for Physics or chemistry in your A level?
08/02/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 525 4924: I fail them at O level with D's grade
08/02/24, 9:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Perkins, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon,
I hope that you are doing well.

Shall we begin the session?
09/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Good morning
09/02/24, 12:11 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Yes
09/02/24, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
09/02/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Iam fine
09/02/24, 12:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/02/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 525 4924: I'm ready to start the lesson
09/02/24, 1:29 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Ok
09/02/24, 1:36 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Sorry to bother you but I wanted to ask about can l have an opportunity  for the  scholarship if I scored More than 10 points at my final exam
09/02/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for the delay as I was having my lunch.
09/02/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Ok no problem
09/02/24, 2:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Have you gone through this
09/02/24, 2:05 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Yes
09/02/24, 2:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So please not you need to have 2 A level passes!
09/02/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Ok
09/02/24, 2:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, I would like to know that if you are interested in Engineering, then why you haven't pursued Physics in your A level.
09/02/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Most schools preference in physics is grade A to C so l didn't get an opportunity to study physics
09/02/24, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
09/02/24, 2:30 pm - +263 77 525 4924: Ok
09/02/24, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, May I know your alternate career aspirations, please?
09/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 525 4924: If aeronautical engineering fails then l will do space networking that involves computers
