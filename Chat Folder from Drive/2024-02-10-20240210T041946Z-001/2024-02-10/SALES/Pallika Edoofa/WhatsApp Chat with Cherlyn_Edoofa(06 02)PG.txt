On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
09/02/24, 11:05 am - +263 77 128 2511: Yess am sir
09/02/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 128 2511: Sir can i ask
09/02/24, 11:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Please ask
09/02/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 128 2511: Do u allow to study nursing   abroad
09/02/24, 11:16 am - +263 77 128 2511: Not at university  but at school of nursing or at hospital
09/02/24, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Cherlyn, Yes, we do facilitate studying nursing abroad, particularly at schools of nursing or hospitals. However, the main requirement for this path is to clear the NEET exam, which serves as a mandatory entrance test for medical and dental courses in India. Additionally, subjects such as biology, physics, and chemistry are prerequisites for pursuing a career in nursing, which you currently do not possess. Therefore, if you're not inclined towards the medical field or unable to meet these subject requirements, exploring other career paths may be more suitable for you.
09/02/24, 11:35 am - +263 77 128 2511: Okk sir i get you now
09/02/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 128 2511: Thank you but most schools in matebeland north  they choose  subject for students
09/02/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 128 2511: How about if  pass the NEET exam without these subject
09/02/24, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Cherlyn, it's not possible for you to pass the NEET exam without the required subjects of biology, physics, and chemistry, then pursuing a career in nursing or medicine may not be feasible at this time. These subjects are fundamental to the field of healthcare and are typically non-negotiable requirements for admission to nursing programs or medical courses.
09/02/24, 11:43 am - +263 77 128 2511: I got you now thanks
09/02/24, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
09/02/24, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, do you want to continue with this?

09/02/24, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
09/02/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 128 2511: Noo
09/02/24, 2:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

09/02/24, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1600-$2700, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
09/02/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 128 2511: Okk  i understand
09/02/24, 2:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this too
09/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 128 2511: Yess sir its affordable   because since i will be doing other programes  that help me to finance mu self with the help of my parents
09/02/24, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
09/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 128 2511: I think maybe by doing attachment or  practical  out of the school campus
09/02/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
09/02/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

09/02/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
