05/02/24, 4:37 pm - +263 71 257 0116: Am good
05/02/24, 4:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
05/02/24, 4:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*

08/02/24, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
08/02/24, 11:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Students can get the opportunity *_to earn while you learn_*, as they get to work on real-time projects by which they will earn scholarship credits worth 50-100$ or more a month which will help to reduce their tuition fees!

08/02/24, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: We are still working on the employability opportunities for our students. At the same time, we are preparing Edoofians throughout their course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and practical learning so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate.
Our students will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills sought by the Industries. 

Once they complete they will already have hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally.
