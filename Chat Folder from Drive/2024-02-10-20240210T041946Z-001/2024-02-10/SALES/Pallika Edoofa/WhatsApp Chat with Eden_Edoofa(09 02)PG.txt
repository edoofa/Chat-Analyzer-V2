I am *Ms. Pallika*, and I am honored to serve as a Career Counselor at Edoofa. Alongside me, we have *Mr. Piiyush*, The Head of Counseling, and *Mr. Jyotishman*, our Head of Admissions Officer.


We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program as referred by *Shantelle* from Zimbabwe


As we were flooded with applications earlier, we didn't want to rush your process, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for you at *10:30 PM CAT tomorrow (09/02/2023)*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. You can also go through our website( www.edoofa.com ). In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application
09/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 667 9791: OK we may start
09/02/24, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Eden,
How are you doing?
09/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 78 667 9791: I'm doing good
09/02/24, 11:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
09/02/24, 11:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.


*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
