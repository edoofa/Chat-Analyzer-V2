05/02/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Mr Petros, meanwhile as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
05/02/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Yes madam if you are free to share to me what's great things are happening in  India which makes you and even us to study there
05/02/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

05/02/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Ooh wonderful to hear such great works and various  competitive institutions in India
Thank you very much
05/02/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/02/24, 1:22 pm - +263 77 391 3337: No we don't have any idea
05/02/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/02/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/02/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/02/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 77 391 3337: At least its cheaper through  Edoofa scholarship  
Thank you for that clarity
05/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
05/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
05/02/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 391 3337: That's good 
May be if you further explain the Earn While You Learn Program
It seems its very good  and reduce cost of education
05/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 391 3337: It's fine ok
05/02/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/02/24, 2:06 pm - +263 77 391 3337: My son is very willing to Earn while learning considering his parents incomes
Well appreciated
05/02/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: I am glad that he would like to participate!
05/02/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Mr Petros, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/02/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 391 3337: That's true Ms, I totally agree
05/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: So Mr Petros, after going through the costs of education in India, are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education Affordable and accessible for international students in India?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/02/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Yes madam I am now in a better position
With Edoofa scholarship education is affordable and accessible especially with the opportunity like Earn while learning
05/02/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
05/02/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/02/24, 2:27 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Really  understand and the way you initiate for cost reduction 
That's good 
Thank you
05/02/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So Mr Petros, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/02/24, 2:30 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Ready
05/02/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: Mr Petros, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
05/02/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 391 3337: $1500-2200
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 391 3337: OK copied
05/02/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 391 3337: It's understood
05/02/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/02/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/02/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/02/24, 2:47 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Copied Ms
05/02/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/02/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
05/02/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Well understood
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:20 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Thanks
05/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
05/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Thank you for connecting me with someone already having someone there 
Definitely let me contact her
Thanks once again
05/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Mr Petros!
05/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Yes we  have connected to each other 
Thanks
05/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
05/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
05/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

05/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please,

You're very welcome.
05/02/24, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: Kindly excuse me for the same,

*Tomorrow, 06-02-23*
05/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians!
05/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 6:51 pm - +263 77 391 3337: I thank you Ms
06/02/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
06/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Good but today network is a challenge uu
06/02/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please!
06/02/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: How was your discussion with Mrs Mashawa and Believe, Mr Petros?
06/02/24, 2:14 pm - +263 78 091 0491: It was well
06/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

How are you doing today, Believe?
06/02/24, 2:28 pm - +263 78 091 0491: I'm doing good and you,
06/02/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: I am doing well please!
06/02/24, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to connect to any of these students, Believe?
06/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 78 091 0491: For now l have not, but I am in the process of getting in touch with them.
06/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

We may continue
06/02/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you had a thorough discussion,

I do understand the network challenges.
06/02/24, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
06/02/24, 5:59 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Fine currently am online

06/02/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
06/02/24, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
06/02/24, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 6:10 pm - +263 77 391 3337: It's fine Ms am going to download it when I reach to somewhere where network is improved 
Thank you very much
06/02/24, 6:13 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please!
06/02/24, 6:15 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Questioning we may proceed no problem  Ms
06/02/24, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: So, Mr Petros, now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
06/02/24, 6:30 pm - +263 77 391 3337: 1 Banchelor of Science in Agriculture 
2 India
3 $6000-8000
4 $2000-3000 per year
5 $350 
6 the next seven days 
7 yes I am clear about this
06/02/24, 6:55 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Mr Petros!

So as a parent, are you thoroughly willing to support Believe's higher education in India both mentally and financially?
06/02/24, 7:02 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Am willing yes
06/02/24, 7:04 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
06/02/24, 7:04 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
06/02/24, 7:04 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
06/02/24, 7:32 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Yes am willing Ms
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th February 2024 for $200 and the 13th or 14th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 13th or 14th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
07/02/24, 8:35 am - +263 77 391 3337: No I am not prepared by the dates indicated 
So far financially am not stable
07/02/24, 8:40 am - Harmehak: Good morning Mr Petros!

07/02/24, 8:46 am - +263 77 391 3337: I am starting to  try and mobilize the finances of which incomes are at minimum but need some few months to mobilizer and not within  a month
07/02/24, 8:55 am - Harmehak: While I do understand, Mr Petros!

I believe you would recall that the studies would begin in August 2024 itself please?
07/02/24, 9:06 am - +263 77 391 3337: It's fine by that time would have organise the resources sure
07/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Indeed Mr Petros!

However currently I am referring to the enrollment fee if Believe is found eligible please.
07/02/24, 9:41 am - +263 77 391 3337: Will try mobilizer finances opting for number 1 option
07/02/24, 9:43 am - Harmehak: I do understand please!

Mr Petros, if you have any queries for me,

Kindly feel free to share!
07/02/24, 9:50 am - +263 77 391 3337: No queries Ms it's fine
07/02/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: Alright please.
07/02/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: Mr Petros, now a short video call interview will be scheduled with the Program Director for you.

After the same, Believe will have a technical round of the interview.

The available slot is of 1 PM CAT.

Shall I reserve the same for you?
07/02/24, 10:49 am - +263 77 391 3337: Noted its ok

May I know why you didn't participate?
07/02/24, 4:36 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Am sorry  the problem  is that  the area where am right now for the next 8 days is a bit trick on network. Currently am on private  WIFI which at a certain time is switched  off.
That's the main challenge I have.

08/02/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Mr Petros, do you recall the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would assist Believe as well as you?
08/02/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: Mr Petros, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.
08/02/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: While it's crucial to understand that education in Zimbabwe is more expensive.
08/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 391 3337: Thank you 
I am  afraid  that  if I may be asked to provide the enrolment fee as per the stipulated dates and months.  This could be  a challenge  even to meet deadlines Unless if there are some other payments that suits  our earnings
