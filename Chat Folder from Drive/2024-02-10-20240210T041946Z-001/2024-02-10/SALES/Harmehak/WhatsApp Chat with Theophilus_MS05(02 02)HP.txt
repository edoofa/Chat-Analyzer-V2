You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/02/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

02/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
02/02/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Mr Tapuwa, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mrs Sekayi better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
02/02/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 374 7918: My name is Tapuwa Madhoyo born and bread in Chipinge District on 01/09/82. I did my A level at Chibuwe High in 2002 and thus my highest level. I was majoring in Maths, Physics and Geography and obtained 7 points. I am failed to proceed to University due to lack of funding since  my father had passed on in 1987. I married Sekayi Chitombo in 2003 when she completed her O level. We were blessed with our first born Theophilus Madhoyo in June 2003. I then worked as temporary teacher in 2006. Currently I am employed as a policeman. My child's performance is the key motivational tool to me for him to go to University. Another thing is that my children must not attain the same level as I did. They must aim higher than what I did since we are living in a world that is changing to better lever as compared to the period when I grew up
02/02/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Mr Tapuwa, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

02/02/24, 3:07 pm - +263 77 374 7918: Mentally l can support him but financially I am crippled. I am just a mere civil servant.
02/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

02/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 374 7918: Yes. Financially with reasonable amount I can afford.
02/02/24, 3:27 pm - +263 77 374 7918: If I have the amount required I will make effort to find that amount
02/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your support and we shall discuss how the costs are made affordable too, Mr Tapuwa.
02/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: I believe Theophilus wishes to study Electrical engineering, Mr Tapuwa?
02/02/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 374 7918: Yes

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
02/02/24, 5:04 pm - +263 77 926 8481: India is one of the best countries which produces high qualified, problem solving Engineers
02/02/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct!
02/02/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

02/02/24, 5:09 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Waal , that's grt
02/02/24, 5:10 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Theophilus.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 5:38 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Yes
02/02/24, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Can you share your knowledge with me as well?
02/02/24, 6:04 pm - +263 77 926 8481: There is need of _accomodation and  _Tuition fees, food, processing of travelling documents, air ticket and health facilities. These sum up to a high demand of a lot of money.
02/02/24, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: Thats very correct!
02/02/24, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 6:06 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Also materials and equipment used in engineering courses cost a lot of money so as to have a well skilled personnel
02/02/24, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: Thats indeed very correct!
02/02/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Theophilius, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that as per your great results, *if you are able to perform well and clear the interview with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition and Basic University Expenses like Library, Laundry, Gym, Wifi.

What are your thoughts on the same?
02/02/24, 6:27 pm - +263 77 926 8481: If I am eligible I think my father would be able to finance me to have a study in India. I will be proud of myself.
02/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate the same, Theophilius!
02/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
02/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/02/24, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

02/02/24, 6:37 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Thank you.
02/02/24, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

However, feel free to question, I would be more than happy to assist.

02/02/24, 6:43 pm - +263 77 926 8481: SEO and   AI stand for what? Some of the terms like skooqs and Blog  means what?.
02/02/24, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: Skoops is an Edtech Company.

AI is Artificial Intelligence.

SEO is Search Engine Operation.

A blog, short for weblog, is a frequently updated web page used for personal commentary or business content. Blogs are often interactive and include sections at the bottom of individual blog posts where readers can leave comments.
02/02/24, 6:47 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Thank you
02/02/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Theophilus!
02/02/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/02/24, 6:58 pm - +263 77 926 8481: EWYL is a good move or initiative done by Edoofa. Since some of the degree programmes took a long period of time for a student abroad, this will assist them to have some money for immediate use. Also this will help students to gain more experience and exposure in their fields of study. Since a student will be given cash he will be able to pay other demanding educational needs hence reducing high demand from the parents which will promptly assist parents to send other children to school.
02/02/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: While you thoroughly understood the Earn While You Learn Program.
02/02/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: I would like to correct that you are given credits and not physical cash that is equivalent to cash itself.
02/02/24, 7:01 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Thank you. These credits will assist in a long way to cater for the period whilst abroad.
02/02/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Theophilus!
02/02/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/02/24, 7:34 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Yes it is. Seen and appreciate
02/02/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 7:36 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Yes
02/02/24, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: Theophilus, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
02/02/24, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/02/24, 7:42 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Ranging from 1500 to 2250
02/02/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/02/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/02/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 7:47 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Okay
02/02/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/02/24, 7:49 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Yes l do
02/02/24, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/02/24, 7:54 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Okay
02/02/24, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/02/24, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
02/02/24, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/02/24, 7:58 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Understood
02/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
02/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
02/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

02/02/24, 8:02 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Ok
02/02/24, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/02/24, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

02/02/24, 8:07 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Thanks
02/02/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything, Theophilus?
02/02/24, 8:08 pm - +263 77 926 8481: No
02/02/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
02/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
02/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

Section 5

To a greater extent it is not true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient.Diet can not be measured on the state of the land but by nutrients consumed with them.Most Africans practice mixed farming of which all the required balanced diet can be obtained.The main problem with Africans is that they are unemployed so they do not have enough money to buy food with different nutrients.Most of the African countries are mountainous and they do not have a lot of stagnant land.Inefficiency of a farm is not measured mainly on the capacity of the soil nutrients because a farmer can make the soil efficient for example by adding organic fertilizers or Artificial fertilizers for the land to produce crops of very good quality.Some African farmers practice crop rotation which will improve in soil fertility.

To a lesser extent,it is true since most Africans live in rural set-ups (reserves).Most Africans are unemployed so they can not afford to buy requirements needed to grow crops in stagnant lands.

03/02/24, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: Received please, let me get it evaluated!
03/02/24, 4:39 pm - +263 77 926 8481: Thanks
03/02/24, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: Good Evening Theophilus,

Now, while I have submitted your test for evaluation, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
03/02/24, 7:32 pm - +263 77 374 7918: I am now online. You can now proceed
03/02/24, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: Sure Mr Tapuwa!

I believe you must have followed the entire discussion so far!

So now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Theophilus's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
03/02/24, 7:40 pm - +263 77 374 7918: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
03/02/24, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
03/02/24, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
03/02/24, 7:45 pm - +263 77 374 7918: Yes I willing to support my son to the fullest
03/02/24, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
03/02/24, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
03/02/24, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
03/02/24, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024 for $200 and the 11th or 12th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
03/02/24, 7:52 pm - +263 77 374 7918: I am financially prepared
03/02/24, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: I acknowledge the same, Mr Tapuwa!
03/02/24, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: However, which option would you like to opt for please?
03/02/24, 7:55 pm - +263 77 374 7918: To pay $350 within 7 days
03/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: I do appreciate your support for Theophilus and your acknowledgement of your preparations!

So the available slots for the interview with the Program Director for Monday are of 12 PM CAT and 1 PM CAT.

Which slot shall I reserve for you and Theophilus, please?
03/02/24, 8:15 pm - +263 77 374 7918: Monday 12 PM CAT

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
07/02/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 374 7918: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 374 7918: Good afternoon to you all. I acknowledged the receipt of acceptance letter from you. I am overwhelmed about the results of my son Theophilus. Now I dialed the number which is said to belong to Needmore Maposa  of Chibuwe High school but unfortunately the number belongs to one Charles Jerere of Zaka High School. Same is aware of the programme. Also issue of clarity is account number. He gave me FBC Account number 5333038014048828. Pliz assist me on these issues.
07/02/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate the same, Mr Tapuwa!
07/02/24, 2:25 pm - +263 77 374 7918: Thank you Counselor
07/02/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: While the same must be a technical eroor,

Following is the Mr Needmore's contact!

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 71 918 3664
07/02/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: Mr Charles is also our associate there in Zimbabwe!

Let me provide you the payment details of Mr Needmore!
07/02/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Maposa's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Needmore Maposa of Chibuwe High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, His daughter is studying in India through the Edoofa Program and from his school over 30 students are studying in India under the Edoofa Program.
07/02/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: The fee payment can also be made through Chibuwe High. School Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Maposa Needmore
