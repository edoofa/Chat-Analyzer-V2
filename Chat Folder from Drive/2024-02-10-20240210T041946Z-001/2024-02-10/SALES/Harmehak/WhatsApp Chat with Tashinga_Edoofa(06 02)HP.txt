You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Piyush who is the Head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

09/02/24, 11:12 am - +263 71 297 7120: Yaa..my  network Is bad this side
09/02/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: I can understand!
09/02/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Tashinga, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Anesu!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
09/02/24, 11:18 am - +263 71 297 7120: An organization that help students to study abroad..
09/02/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Well received, now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/02/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
09/02/24, 11:41 am - +263 71 297 7120: So what does one require to get a 100%scholarship
09/02/24, 11:52 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship please?
09/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 71 297 7120: A scholarship when tuition and food are catered for
09/02/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
09/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 71 297 7120: Yaaa I got it
09/02/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Tashinga, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Nyazura Adventist High charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
09/02/24, 12:48 pm - +263 71 297 7120: I finished my Advanced level last year with 15points in maths bio and chemistry doing nothing now. Nyazura uses to pay 400 every term. Biology is my strength, I wish to study medicine.
My parents are self employed 
They all ended at their O-level.
I have a sister with 10As at her O-level in her advanced level now. A brother with 6 units at grade 7 but on a local day school for his form 1
09/02/24, 12:48 pm - +263 71 297 7120: I have 8As 1B,!1C on my O-level
09/02/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Tashinga, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

May I know about the field of their self employment?
09/02/24, 12:53 pm - +263 71 297 7120: My father has a lorry he uses for hiring and my mother runs a tuckshop at our rural area
09/02/24, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Tashinga!
09/02/24, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate regarding the same?
09/02/24, 12:57 pm - +263 71 297 7120: My mother's sis is trying to take me back to school  and she is willing to pay for some reasonable cost that's why I'm trying to use this scholarship program
09/02/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Tashinga!
09/02/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Great results in A level!

Could you please share both A and O level results in a picture format?
09/02/24, 1:02 pm - +263 71 297 7120: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 1:02 pm - +263 71 297 7120: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Great!
09/02/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study Medicine?
09/02/24, 1:10 pm - +263 71 297 7120: Its because in my rural area there is no proper hospital and medical facilities.... I want to fill in that gap if given the opportunity
09/02/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Tashinga!

Since the results are already out, didn't you happen to apply to any other institue?
09/02/24, 1:18 pm - +263 71 297 7120: No because all institutes that offer medicine are not yet open for any applications
09/02/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!

Which all institutions are you aiming at?
09/02/24, 1:19 pm - +263 71 297 7120: UZ and NUST
09/02/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

What is your take on studying in Zimbabwe or in India, Tashinga?
09/02/24, 1:26 pm - +263 71 297 7120: Zimbabwe  preferentially because there won't be any need for those travell expenses and I can't afford those personally.

But India for it's best education offers I would love to study there
09/02/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: Tashinga, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

What is your take on the same?
09/02/24, 1:33 pm - +263 71 297 7120: Yaah will go for India .... because all I want is cheap education
09/02/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind only wanting cheap education, Tashinga?
09/02/24, 1:36 pm - +263 71 297 7120: My parents cannot afford for my tertiary education
09/02/24, 1:36 pm - +263 71 297 7120: I'm under someone assistance
09/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: While I understand the same,

May I know who has been supporting your education so far, financially?
09/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 71 297 7120: My parents ... they have been selling their assets for the three of us to go school.. but they can't afford with me in my tertiary education and they were planning to send me to join the army if this relative fails to assist. And their cater for the other two
09/02/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: I can understand, Tashinga!
09/02/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 297 7120: At least you do
09/02/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Tashinga could you add your aunt as well as your mother to the group?
09/02/24, 2:33 pm - +263 71 297 7120: My mother is not on WhatsApp but for my aunt ... I hadn't told her that this is what I was up to
09/02/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: Mother's name: Thembekile Ndlovu
Mother's contact number: +263775796460

She happened to receive an invite!
09/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 71 297 7120: Yaah that number is on WhatsApp ssry for the inconvenience
09/02/24, 2:40 pm - +263 71 297 7120: They share that contact with my father for whatsaap purposes
09/02/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: While I understand Tashinga, don't you believe its crucial to discuss with her if she is the one who is going to support you financially?
09/02/24, 3:08 pm - +263 71 297 7120: Yaaa of course it is crucial.... but she is always busy and I do not know how she will react of it.
09/02/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
09/02/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Tashinga, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially with roughly $1200-$1400 annually?
09/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 71 297 7120: Doing medicine
09/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: Did you read the question please?
09/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 297 7120: Yaaah their commitment is really important
09/02/24, 3:20 pm - +263 71 297 7120: Yaah they are willing to pay
09/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate their support!
09/02/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: So did you happen to research about the requirements of Medicine too?
09/02/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 297 7120: No... I didn't
09/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/02/24, 3:49 pm - +263 71 297 7120: So I don't fit for medicine
09/02/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
09/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 71 297 7120: Umm I can't go for these
09/02/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Now, if a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in the field it is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially.
09/02/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: If you have a bachelor's degree in Medical Laboratory Technology from India and are interested in pursuing further studies in medicine, you may consider the following options:

1. **Doctor of Medicine (MD):**
   - MD is a postgraduate degree that medical professionals pursue to specialize in a specific field of medicine. Specializations can include internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, radiology, pathology, etc.

2. **Master of Surgery (MS):**
   - Similar to MD, MS is a postgraduate degree that focuses on surgical specialties. Surgeons typically pursue this degree to specialize in areas such as general surgery, orthopedics, ophthalmology, etc.

3. **Diplomate of National Board (DNB):**
   - DNB is a postgraduate or postdoctoral degree in various medical specialties. It is offered by the National Board of Examinations in India and is equivalent to MD or MS.

4. **Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Pathology (DCP):**
   - This is a diploma program that focuses on clinical pathology and is suitable for individuals with a background in laboratory technology.

5. **Masters in Public Health (MPH):**
   - If you are interested in public health, an MPH degree could be a good option. It covers a range of topics including epidemiology, health policy, biostatistics, and environmental health.

6. **Hospital Management/Administration:**
   - You may consider pursuing a Master's in Hospital Administration or Healthcare Management to take on administrative roles in healthcare organizations.

It's important to note that the specific options available to you may depend on the admission requirements of the medical schools or universities in the country where you plan to pursue further studies. Additionally, some countries may have specific requirements for international medical graduates, so it's advisable to research the admission criteria for the institutions you're interested in.

Keep in mind that different countries may have different systems of medical education, and the nomenclature of degrees may vary. It's crucial to carefully research and understand the educational and licensing requirements of the country in which you plan to practice medicine.
09/02/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
