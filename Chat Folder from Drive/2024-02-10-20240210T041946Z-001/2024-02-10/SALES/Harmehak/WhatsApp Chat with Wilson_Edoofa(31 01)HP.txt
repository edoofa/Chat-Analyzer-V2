01/02/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: I do understand and appreciate your noble cause,

Wilson, I would like to understand regarding your subject combination!

You didn't opt for Biology?
I believe it's a crucial science subject to study Medicine as it's all related to human body and living beings, isn't it?
01/02/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 732 8540: I wanted to have a wide variety of choices so I took physics
01/02/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: While that's understandable!

Don't you believe Biology is also a rather crucial subject for Medicine, Wilson?
01/02/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 732 8540: I will get used to it. I will adapt
01/02/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
01/02/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 732 8540: OK. So it is not possible to do medicine?
01/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
01/02/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Now, if a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in the field it is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially.
01/02/24, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

02/02/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 732 8540: OK I understand
02/02/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: That's only if you wish to work in the field of Forensic Medicine.
02/02/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Ohh OK.  For crimes ?
02/02/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: Yes please.
02/02/24, 3:07 pm - +263 77 732 8540: OK understood
02/02/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue Bachelors of science in medical laboratory Technology, Wilson?
02/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Yes
02/02/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Wilson, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
02/02/24, 3:40 pm - +263 77 732 8540: In 5 years i would have finished the undergraduate degree, and if God allows and I get a job in India, I would have capital to start my car repairing company, motor parts shop and forex trading that I want to venture in. I want also to help the children from a poor background especially in my rural home in Sezhube.
02/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 77 732 8540: When I get into the edoofa program it would enable me to pursue my career without straining my parents much. It will also enable me to get to know other people outside my nation who may be a connection for me when I start my businesses
02/02/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Wilson, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

However, since you wish to venture into car repairing company itself,

May I know you aren't pursuing Engineering instead?
02/02/24, 3:44 pm - +263 77 732 8540: I want to someday save lives
02/02/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 732 8540: That's my inspiration
02/02/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful.
02/02/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/02/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Wilson!
02/02/24, 4:08 pm - +263 77 732 8540: The chances of getting a job after the degree are slim
02/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: You see, Wilson, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
02/02/24, 4:13 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Yes. So wanna take a chance of studying abroad, provided that it's financially friendly
02/02/24, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: I do understand and I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Wilson!

You will definitely understand how studying in India would be affordable more than in Zimbabwe as we proceed ahead.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
02/02/24, 4:17 pm - +263 77 732 8540: I have heard that India has great minds, in medicine and engineering. I am fascinated by their level of IQ and i feel I won't struggle during the course as they will be of great help, to help me understand
02/02/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Wilson!
02/02/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

02/02/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: While you cannot work on a student visa!

We will discuss regarding the costs as well as the Earn While You Learn Program too, Wilson!
02/02/24, 4:25 pm - +263 77 732 8540: OK tell me about it
02/02/24, 4:28 pm - Harmehak: We will discuss!
02/02/24, 4:28 pm - Harmehak: Firstly did you read the same ?
02/02/24, 4:43 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Yes
02/02/24, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Wilson!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 4:51 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Around 1300 per semester for tuition fees, am I wrong?
02/02/24, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 4:56 pm - +263 77 732 8540: OK noted
02/02/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 4:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:58 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Ok
02/02/24, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Wilson, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that as per your great results, *if you are able to perform well and clear the interview with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition and Basic University Expenses like Library, Laundry, Gym, Wifi.

What are your thoughts on the same?
02/02/24, 5:07 pm - +263 77 732 8540: It is ok
02/02/24, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the higher quantum of scholarship along with Affordability, Wilson?
02/02/24, 5:14 pm - +263 77 732 8540: It is OK. Do you pay the tuition fees in one go
02/02/24, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: Firstly did you happen to understand that the fee that is $1200-1800 is inclusive of Tuition fee (if any), Accomodation, Food and Basic University Expenses, Wilson?
02/02/24, 5:17 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Yes I understood
02/02/24, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: Now you see Wilson, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
02/02/24, 5:19 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Oh I pay 1600 per year?
02/02/24, 5:22 pm - +263 77 732 8540: It is great
02/02/24, 5:27 pm - Harmehak: Like I was discussed with you earlier, 

If you get a higher quantum of scholarship your fee would be between $1200-1800 <This message was edited>
02/02/24, 5:27 pm - Harmehak: I do appreciate, Wilson.
02/02/24, 5:56 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Understood
02/02/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: Wilson, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/02/24, 6:04 pm - +263 77 732 8540: I do
02/02/24, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: So now, are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Wilson?
02/02/24, 6:25 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Yes
02/02/24, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
02/02/24, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/02/24, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/02/24, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

02/02/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Wilson!
02/02/24, 7:27 pm - +263 77 732 8540: I was still reading
02/02/24, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
02/02/24, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/02/24, 7:38 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Wow am amazed
02/02/24, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Wilson!
02/02/24, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/02/24, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 7:41 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Noted
02/02/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Wilson as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
02/02/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
02/02/24, 7:43 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Ok
02/02/24, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: Kindly address the same.
02/02/24, 7:47 pm - +263 77 732 8540: 1500
02/02/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/02/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/02/24, 7:49 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Ok
02/02/24, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?

02/02/24, 7:57 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Yes I do
02/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/02/24, 7:59 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Ok
02/02/24, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/02/24, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
02/02/24, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/02/24, 8:02 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Am still reading
02/02/24, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

02/02/24, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
02/02/24, 8:11 pm - +263 77 732 8540: Thank you so much
02/02/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
02/02/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
02/02/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
02/02/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

02/02/24, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “03-02-23” at 9 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

03/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Alright
03/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.

03/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 77 732 8540: OK I will
03/02/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
