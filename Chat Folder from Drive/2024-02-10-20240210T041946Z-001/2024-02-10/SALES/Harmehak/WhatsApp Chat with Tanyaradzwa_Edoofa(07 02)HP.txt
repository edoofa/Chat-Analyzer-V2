The already enrolled students seem to have achieved a lot in terms of their studies. They, if not all, have expressed how they have gotten some help through your scholarship program.
08/02/24, 9:51 am - +263 77 397 5461: So I have learnt that whether we seem to worlds afar, opportunities still present themselves ahead of us.
08/02/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 397 5461: * seem to be
08/02/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Mr Njanike!
08/02/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/02/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

08/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 397 5461: Thank you. I'm a father of two currently working as a Safety Officer for a local company. I am a holder of a National Diploma from a polytechnic college here in Zimbabwe. I'm happily married to Mrs Njanike (born Lucia Chikandiwa) and we are blessed with two bright girls. Mrs Njanike is in currently enrolled at a teachers college, an initiative which I have encouraged her to consider in order to be a learned woman. Tanyaradzwa, my daughter, has been a bright child from her early days in her childhood who has managed to excel well up A-level.  I'm much motivated in giving her the support she needs because she would always talk and still talks of taking her education to higher levels. Her school results have always been impressive.
08/02/24, 10:55 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Mr Njinike, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

08/02/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 397 5461: Thats a provisional statement, certificates are not yet out.
08/02/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/02/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: So what exactly would she like to pursue for her higher education please?
08/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 271 9098: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
08/02/24, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: Kindly address the same.
08/02/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 397 5461: Bachelor of Pharmacy or Bachelor of Medicine

08/02/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
09/02/24, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/02/24, 9:39 am - +263 77 397 5461: Good morning.
And to your question, yes I have not done much in terms of assessing the qualification requirements for what you offer in your country. Here science subjects are mostly considered for entry into the fields I mentioned earlier.
09/02/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: I understand!
09/02/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/02/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Now you see to pursue medicine even in Zimbabwe, Chemistry is a mandatory requirement.
09/02/24, 9:43 am - +263 77 397 5461: Yes I get the point.
09/02/24, 9:44 am - +263 77 397 5461: So what would you suggest for me
09/02/24, 9:45 am - Harmehak: Now as per her interests as well as subject combination, she can pursue either of the following courses under health care sector-

1. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*
09/02/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 397 5461: Well said. In the meantime allow me to discuss with her your listed options.
09/02/24, 9:49 am - Harmehak: Sure please, Mr Njanike!
09/02/24, 9:51 am - +263 77 397 5461: Thanks. I will communicate with you.
09/02/24, 9:53 am - Harmehak: Duly noted!

By when shall I expect to hear from you please?
09/02/24, 9:54 am - +263 77 397 5461: Before end of your day
09/02/24, 9:54 am - Harmehak: Sure please!
09/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 397 5461: Good afternoon Ms Harmehak,
Can you in the meantime consider Tanyaradzwa for the second and third program. I will share with you on Monday her final decision. Thanks and good day.
09/02/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!

I would also like to share something important before the same!
09/02/24, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: Now, if a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in the field it is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially.
09/02/24, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: If you have a bachelor's degree in Medical Laboratory Technology from India and are interested in pursuing further studies in medicine, you may consider the following options:

1. **Doctor of Medicine (MD):**
   - MD is a postgraduate degree that medical professionals pursue to specialize in a specific field of medicine. Specializations can include internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, radiology, pathology, etc.

2. **Master of Surgery (MS):**
   - Similar to MD, MS is a postgraduate degree that focuses on surgical specialties. Surgeons typically pursue this degree to specialize in areas such as general surgery, orthopedics, ophthalmology, etc.

3. **Diplomate of National Board (DNB):**
   - DNB is a postgraduate or postdoctoral degree in various medical specialties. It is offered by the National Board of Examinations in India and is equivalent to MD or MS.

4. **Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Pathology (DCP):**
   - This is a diploma program that focuses on clinical pathology and is suitable for individuals with a background in laboratory technology.

5. **Masters in Public Health (MPH):**
   - If you are interested in public health, an MPH degree could be a good option. It covers a range of topics including epidemiology, health policy, biostatistics, and environmental health.

6. **Hospital Management/Administration:**
   - You may consider pursuing a Master's in Hospital Administration or Healthcare Management to take on administrative roles in healthcare organizations.

It's important to note that the specific options available to you may depend on the admission requirements of the medical schools or universities in the country where you plan to pursue further studies. Additionally, some countries may have specific requirements for international medical graduates, so it's advisable to research the admission criteria for the institutions you're interested in.

Keep in mind that different countries may have different systems of medical education, and the nomenclature of degrees may vary. It's crucial to carefully research and understand the educational and licensing requirements of the country in which you plan to practice medicine.
09/02/24, 4:30 pm - +263 77 397 5461: Received, thanks
09/02/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: Now shall I brief you about *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*?
09/02/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
