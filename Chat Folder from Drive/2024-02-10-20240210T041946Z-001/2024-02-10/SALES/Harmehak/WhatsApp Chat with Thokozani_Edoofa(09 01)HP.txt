My weaknesses- loss of a loved one has been my greatest weakness 
Hobbies- l like to bake n cook

11/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Wow interesting
11/01/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: I understand
11/01/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Thokozani!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
11/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 77 360 0968: No  not really noone from my family has ever been to india
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: I do understand
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk l understand
11/01/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
11/01/24, 2:41 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Yeah thats a really good
11/01/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
11/01/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries?
11/01/24, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, so I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
11/01/24, 8:30 pm - +263 77 360 0968: No nothing
11/01/24, 8:31 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Apologies my phone shut and l had no where to charge it like l had mentioned we had no power today
11/01/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: I understand
11/01/24, 8:37 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Will do ..thank you
12/01/24, 9:06 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
12/01/24, 9:08 am - +263 77 360 0968: Morning..yes we may proceed
12/01/24, 9:09 am - Harmehak: Alright please
12/01/24, 9:10 am - Harmehak: Thokozani, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/01/24, 9:15 am - +263 77 360 0968: Yes thats an average estimation
12/01/24, 9:18 am - Harmehak: Indeed, so are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Thokozani?
12/01/24, 9:21 am - +263 77 360 0968: Yes it is to a greater extent.
12/01/24, 9:21 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
12/01/24, 9:21 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/01/24, 9:21 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/01/24, 9:21 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 360 0968: Are they tought how to do the work <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 9:40 am - Harmehak: You would have a dedicated mentor who would assist you with your EWYL projects.
12/01/24, 9:41 am - +263 77 360 0968: Ohhh owk owk thats good then
12/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Yes please
12/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 360 0968: Owk l understand this is a great program 🙏🏼
12/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/01/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: They depend on student's hardwork.
12/01/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 360 0968: Monthly or they are consistent
12/01/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 360 0968: Wow owk thats good then
12/01/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: You earn credits every month.
12/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 360 0968: Owk owk
12/01/24, 10:37 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 360 0968: Yes l ama
12/01/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Thokozani, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/01/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/01/24, 10:40 am - +263 77 360 0968: $1500-$2250
12/01/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/01/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/01/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 360 0968: Owk
12/01/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 360 0968: So we pay to be enrolled for the schoolarship program..and ld also have to pay for the university application
12/01/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: I hope after going through the same you have a better clarity regarding your question?
12/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 360 0968: So in simple terms the $350 caters for the above .
Includin university application fee <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Very correct, Thokozani
12/01/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/01/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 360 0968: Owk understood
12/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
12/01/24, 11:08 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/01/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 360 0968: Yes l have
12/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 77 360 0968: So what happens if l dont get accepted to any university but accepted by the program
12/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Your fee is refunded
12/01/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 360 0968: With what assurance
12/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
12/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
12/01/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 360 0968: ?
12/01/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk
12/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 360 0968: So the visa is renewed yearly?
12/01/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: It's only renewed once you are here in India.
12/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Hmm ok
12/01/24, 12:37 pm - +263 77 360 0968: And what assurance do l have for the refund if lm not admitted
12/01/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Thokozani, you only proceed ahead if you are found eligible.

I believe you recall that I already have your results, isn't it?
12/01/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: If you are accepted into the program then you proceed ahead with Enrollment.
12/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: You must have gone through where I shared regarding Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission.
12/01/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 360 0968: I know but my family would also like to know the guarantee of the refund if not admitted ..my parents wont be the ones paying for the application but the family
12/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 77 360 0968: I went through that dear that is why l asked what happens if l dont get admission you were the one who told me there's a refund thats why l asked ,on what grounds of assurance is the refund. Cause if a guarantee of admission was the case you should have stated that when l asked what happens when l dont get admission we wouldnt be here in the first place <This message was edited>
12/01/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Like I briefed you if Edoofa fails to provide you an admission your fee is refunded, Thokozani.

Now considering you already have your results with you, your would be provided an acceptance letter from Edoofa, after the same you pay the enrollment fee.
12/01/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: We do provide guarantee of admission itself,

Why would you receive an acceptance letter if your documents would not already be evaluated?

You would be going through thorough interview and test,

Whereby if found eligible, then only you proceed.

Admission is guaranteed.
12/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 360 0968: I get all that ...my concern is what assurance do l have for the refund if lm to be accepted..
Should l just put my trust in your word that they'll be a refund or theres something solidarity to that.
12/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 77 360 0968: And again why is there an option of refund if lm eligible to admission guarantee
12/01/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Thokozani, are you thoroughly following what I am sharing?
12/01/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: *If Edoofa fails to provide you an admission then the fee is refunded.*

*Guarantee of admission is on the basis of your results and academic performance.*
12/01/24, 1:07 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Im not sure you get me as well but then lets proceed
12/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk
12/01/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Since you already have enough gap in your education and your results are with you,

Your documents would be evaluated well in advance.

You would receive an acceptance letter only if you qualify.

There are no chances of you not receiving an admission.
12/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Ok
12/01/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: You are confusing two different things together.

I hope you understood that refunds are processed if we as an organisation fail to provide you an admission. 

You donot have any role ina that.
12/01/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Ok
12/01/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: However guarantee of admission is related to your academic results which will be processed first.
12/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Ok
12/01/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Do you have any queries for me?

Feel free to share so that you have no doubts left.
12/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Proceed please
12/01/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to connect with your friend Abigail?

I believe you must be aware she is already in India!
12/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Yes she did say
12/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Do connect her with your father or relatives if they require a better understanding from a student itself.
12/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk
12/01/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: I would like to add to your understanding in a rather simplified manner,

Students start with their higher education with Edoofa while they are still in their Upper 6.

While this happens, if they donot meet the mandatory requirement, there fee is refunded in the later stage.

Now your case being completed different, as we wouldn't have proceeded ahead with your application itself if you wouldn't qualify on the basis of your results!
12/01/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: I believe you must recall I submitted your results for evaluation earlier?
12/01/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Now as your results do qualify for the requirements of your desired course,

Admission is guaranteed.
12/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk
12/01/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Now do you have a better understanding?
12/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk l hear you
12/01/24, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: I believe your concern is addressed now?
12/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Yes
12/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Great,

Do you have any queries for me?
12/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 360 0968: No proceed please
12/01/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/01/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/01/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Owk will do
12/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

13/01/24, 4:58 pm - +263 77 360 0968: Topic :ls it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant. 

To a greater extent that is true .Most African countries lack agricultural funding and modern knowledge and utensils (machinery) which lead to such factors addressed here. A poor economy is also a huge misfortune to the agricultural efficiency. Drought being another major factor, with water sufficient farns are stagnant and efficient,water sources dry out from the over heat and when rain is expected few amounts of it come. Making water reserves expensive and a huge expense to the farmers. With the production of inefficient crops poor diets excavate due to lack of nutrients from the farm produce. Most business also oftenly run losses.

To a lesser extent, not all produce from farms are stagnant and the good produce either from the wealthy farms who have irrigation systems and drilled water from underground can produce good crops with good nutrients. These companies are always happy with their trade cause they dont depend on natural sources like dams and rain for water their crops are always efficient though they are not enough to cater for everyone they have a limited prduction and they cant increase production due to resources hence poor diet still excavates around countries since other will have to buy the inefficient crop produce.

15/01/24, 10:18 am - Harmehak: That's great
15/01/24, 10:19 am - Harmehak: Are you willing to support Thokozani with the same, Mr Xolani?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note.

15/01/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
15/01/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
15/01/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
15/01/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 22nd or 23rd January 2024 for $200 and the  22nd or 23rd of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 22nd or 23rd January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
15/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 71 510 1992: I understand l think number 1 would do fine by me
15/01/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: Duly noted, Mr Xolani.

Now I would be submitting Thokozani's application for the interview with the Program Director.

Shall I share the available slots?
15/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 71 510 1992: Do share
15/01/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Sure please
15/01/24, 10:50 am - Harmehak: The available slots for tomorrow are of 10 and 10:30 AM CAT.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/01/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd.

18/01/24, 1:16 pm - +61 437 679 079: Thank you for the information, I see that Edoofa is well connected with Zimbabwean schools, that is very pleasing.
18/01/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Mrs Sithole!

19/01/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
19/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, do you have any queries for me related to the program or Thokozani's application please?
19/01/24, 12:45 pm - +61 437 679 079: 1. If the applicant is successful when does she start the program? 
2 . Are the airfares covered by the scholarship?
19/01/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: She would be starting the Program this year in August.
19/01/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
19/01/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are done with Step 1, and right now we are at Step 2, and then if she would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
19/01/24, 12:49 pm - +61 437 679 079: Noted and understood, thank you
19/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: You see, for international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets because The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$450, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August this year as per your preparations <This message was edited>
