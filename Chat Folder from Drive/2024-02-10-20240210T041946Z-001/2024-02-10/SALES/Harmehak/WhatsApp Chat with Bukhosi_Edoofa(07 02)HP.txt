08/02/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
08/02/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I would like to add that, A *Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Microbiology is closely related to Animal Science* through the study of microbiological interactions within animal ecosystems. Microbiology plays a crucial role in understanding the microbial communities present in animals, including their gut microbiota, immune responses, and disease mechanisms. In Animal Science, microbiology knowledge aids in studying animal health, nutrition, and welfare. Microorganisms affect digestion, disease resistance, and environmental sustainability within animal production systems. By understanding microbial processes, such as fermentation and symbiosis, students can optimize animal health, productivity, and the sustainability of livestock operations. Therefore, a strong foundation in microbiology is invaluable for professionals in Animal Science, fostering advancements in animal health management, disease control, and food safety.
08/02/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 935 8444: okay my first option here will be Bachelor of science in microbiology and secondly Bachelor of science in cardiovascular technology
08/02/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/02/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Microbiology is intricately connected with Animal Science. Microbiology explores the microbial world, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, while Animal Science focuses on the study of animals, their behavior, physiology, nutrition, and health. These fields intersect in various ways, particularly concerning animal health, disease prevention, and food safety. Microbiological knowledge is essential in understanding the complex interactions between animals and microorganisms, such as the role of gut microbiota in digestion, immunity, and disease resistance. Additionally, microbiology contributes to animal nutrition research, fermentation processes for feed production, and the development of probiotics for animal health. Overall, a B.Sc in Microbiology provides a valuable foundation for students pursuing careers in Animal Science, enabling them to address critical issues related to animal health, welfare, and productivity.
08/02/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 935 8444: okay thanks
08/02/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: Now let me brief you about Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Microbiology!
08/02/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 935 8444: okay can you also brief me on bachelor of science in cardiovascular technology
08/02/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Sure!

Will discuss one after the other!
08/02/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: *B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.

08/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 935 8444: I have understood both programs
08/02/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

What is your personal understanding, Bukhosi?

Along with the same which out of the two are you more inclined towards?
08/02/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 935 8444: micro biology
08/02/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: What is your own understanding of the course, Bukhosi?
08/02/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 935 8444: Microbiology is the study of the biology of microscopic organisms - viruses, bacteria, algae, fungi, slime molds, and protozoa. The methods used to study and manipulate these minute and mostly unicellular organisms differ from those used in most other biological investigations.
08/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Received!
08/02/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright Bukhosi, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
08/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 935 8444: in 5 years time I see myself pursuing being a l Cell biologist
08/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 935 8444: Edoofa can enable me to achieve my dreams by supporting me financial to be able to pursue the program
08/02/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: That is great Bukhosi, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/02/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 935 8444: I understand that abroad it's well equipped with infrastructure and good laboratories to aid students in their learning activities as compared to my country
08/02/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Bukhosi, I am delighted to see your dedication for higher education in India and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your parents are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
08/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 772 7249: As parents we will as much as possible to support his studies abroad as India is home to innovation and solutions. Also as we are supporting Bukhosi's sibbling we are obliged to do the same to him
08/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement, Mr Moyo!

08/02/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the shared resources thoroughly, Bukhosi?
08/02/24, 12:52 pm - +263 77 935 8444: yes I have done so
08/02/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: I am glad,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
08/02/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 935 8444: without the scholarships no
08/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright, I believe you must be aware of the costs of your brother, isn't it?
08/02/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 935 8444: with the scholarship yes
08/02/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Could you please share your knowledge with me?
08/02/24, 1:31 pm - +263 77 935 8444: it was $3500
08/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 935 8444: okay thank you it's understandable
08/02/24, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
08/02/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 935 8444: it is something to quite appreciate
08/02/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 935 8444: But I please know more about this earn while you learn program I don't seem to be understanding it well
08/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Sure, let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
08/02/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 935 8444: okay
08/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 935 8444: okay now I understand this looks like a very good program to appreciate indeed
08/02/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
08/02/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/02/24, 1:52 pm - +263 77 935 8444: okay Thank you
08/02/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 772 7249: It is quite appreciated. It will assist the student achieve his  academic dream and be proffesional
08/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/02/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Mr Moyo.
08/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 935 8444: So where can I get these courses, which Universities?
08/02/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 289 8718: When will be that madam?
08/02/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: What are you to referring to please, Mrs Moyo?
08/02/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 289 8718: Isnt you said we will receive applications from various universities during registration, from which will choose a university to go for
08/02/24, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: I will be discussing the entires details of the process now itself please!
08/02/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: You would receive acceptance letters during the Admission process please!
08/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 289 8718: OK my dear
08/02/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Bukhosi did you follow the video too?
08/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 935 8444: yes I followed thank you
08/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 289 8718: Thus the time we will choose University of interest
08/02/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
08/02/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
08/02/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 935 8444: yes am ready
08/02/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: Bukhosi, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
08/02/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/02/24, 2:31 pm - +263 77 935 8444: the student will end up spending $1500 - $2250
08/02/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/02/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/02/24, 2:33 pm - +263 77 935 8444: okay
08/02/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 935 8444: yah it surely is
08/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 935 8444: okay that's really convenient on the parents side much appreciated
08/02/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
08/02/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/02/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
08/02/24, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/02/24, 2:46 pm - +263 77 935 8444: yes I understood
08/02/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/02/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
08/02/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
08/02/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:49 pm - +263 77 935 8444: okay
08/02/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/02/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
08/02/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 772 7249: We quite appreciate the guidance you have given us
08/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 289 8718: Why are visas are only valid for 1year when the programme could 3 to 4years?
08/02/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Bukhosi.
08/02/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 289 8718: OK thanks for the clarification. Who meets expenses involved in renewal
08/02/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: No expenses are occured for the same.

Bukhosi will only be submitting the documents once in India and after the same the visa will be renewed.
08/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 77 289 8718: This sounds great and exciting. What about the flight✈ expenses from India?. Also hoping that Universities are accredited
08/02/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$490, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August this year as per your preparations
08/02/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: Each of the universities are accredited please!
08/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 289 8718: OK thanks for the response
08/02/24, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: Now that we have concluded with the entire process of today's counseling session!

Kindly feel free to share your queries!
08/02/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 289 8718: The issue of 100% scholarship is not clear or its cover scholarship credit
08/02/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: Can you please first elaborate your understanding of a 100% scholarship?
08/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 77 289 8718: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

We offer 50-100% scholarship on Tuition fee.
08/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 77 289 8718: OK, what will be the basis of the range given above.  In simpler terms what qualifys me to get 90% or 50% since its a range
08/02/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
08/02/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 289 8718: OK thanks for the clarification
08/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Moyo, since you already have one child in India,

I would like to hear from you regarding the finances at Edoofa and your comparisons please!
08/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 77 289 8718: The challenge am having l can't compare the two now, since my child haven't been enrolled under Edoofa.  True colours of what you are will be revealed after enrollment and admissions.
08/02/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Moyo, while I understand what you are sharing!

Can you please address your later statement as to which true colours are you referring to?
08/02/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understand that an organisation that has more than 2000 students as a part of the program with such reputed schools and authorities associated isn't lying about what is being discussed!
08/02/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: While it's equally important to know and understand that every single detail and cost has already been discussed with you.
08/02/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: Do take out time to connect with Mrs Ruth too!
08/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 77 772 7249: Its great honour to have the discussion which enlightened us

08/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE

 *Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient?* 
 
 Poor diets could be defined as food that lacks some of the required nutrients. Then stagnant and inefficient farms are those which are not productive. The farmers diet is situational dependant affected by a number of factors. Locations of farms tend to vary. Some are located in high rainfall areas while some in drought prone areas. Some crops don't know favour growing in water logged areas, hence the farmer will produce water tolerant crops with its product deficient in certain nutrient(s). Its either the farmer will be forced to buy other food from other areas to meet the human nutrient requirement. Where accessibility of supplementary crops are not  available the farmer maybe forced by some circumstances to eat poor diet.  In another scenario the farmer will be have access to all the food needed either from his farm produce or from purchase from other farmers in nearby community or distance. Due to these variations the crop yield tend to vary. Furthermore, the geographical location of the farm affects the choice of crops to be grown. Also the agricultural technology knowledge of the farmer affects the crop yield. At the same time the production techniques also affect the crop to be grown and the yield. The soil fertility also contributes to the choice of crop to be grown and the yield. In addition, the soil fertility affects the nutritivity of the crop produced. Prevalence of disease and pests also tend to affect the crop type and yield potential of the crop. The above factors affect the choice of crop to be grown and the yield. The culture of the society where the food is produced contributes what to be produced. In certain culture or region maize is the stable food, which is deficient to certain amino acids. Others farmers will fortify or blend with certain amino acid rich food such beef or beans.  Thereafter the food will be nutritional balanced, However, some famers will lack the ingredients to nutritional balance their food resulting in poor diets. In this scenario those who lack the amino acid rich ingredients would consume poor diet.
Farmer with inadequate agricultural production skill will harvest less than the crop potential resulting insufficient food for the family. Due lack of agricultural skill the farmer just produces crops without nutritional focus. However not all farmers lack the production skill, as such they will produce crops that meet their nutritional needs of the farmer and animals. Those animals fed on properly balanced diet are productive hence their products are are nutritious. Surplus will be sold. While some farmers take farming as a commercial unit and sell their products to the market. Some farmers who are financial stable who generate their money by other activities such as mining buys the produce to prepare nutritional balanced food.  The availability of poor diet is variable depending on the situation where the farm is endowed with good growing resources. In summary African diets are neither poor nor rich, as some farms are not stagnant.

 *My Inspirational story* 

My name is Bukhosi, and I am a 19-year-old with a strong passion for the environment, and the world of knowledge that comes from reading. Growing up in a small family with my big brother and my parents, I learned the value of hard work and determination. Despite facing challenges, I have held onto my dreams and aspirations, always striving to make them a reality.

My educational journey began at Solusi Adventist High School in Zimbabwe, where I discovered my love for learning and excelled in my O level studies. However, just before I wrote my final exams, my world was turned upside down when I was attacked by the COVID-19 virus. At that moment, I didn't think I would survive, let alone perform well in my exams. But through perseverance and determination, I not only survived but also managed to excel in my O level exams. This experience taught me the resilience that lies within me and instilled a deep appreciation for the fragility and preciousness of life.

Moving on to my A level studies, I faced new challenges and setbacks. Despite my best efforts, I did not achieve the results I had hoped for in my final exams. However, this disappointment did not deter my determination to continue my academic journey. My dream of pursuing a degree  remains unwavering, and I am committed to working as hard as possible to achieve this goal. I aspire to earn my first degree in my field of interest and am eager to push myself further in pursuit of advanced achievements in this field. The opportunity to study overseas in a renowned program is something I have longed for, and I am driven by the desire to turn this dream into a reality.

Throughout my journey, I have experienced firsthand the importance of resilience, tenacity, and never giving up on one's dreams. These experiences have shaped me into a person who is determined to overcome any obstacle standing in the way of my aspirations. I am fueled by the belief that education and knowledge hold the key to unlocking potential and creating positive change in the world.

As I look ahead, I am eager to find a university that aligns with my ambitions and provides the support I need to attain my dreams.

My journey may have been marked by challenges, but it has also been defined by resilience, hope, and an unyielding commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and personal growth. I am ready to take on the next chapter of my academic journey, armed with determination and a steadfast belief in my ability to achieve my aspirations.
09/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Received please!

Let me get it evaluated!
09/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 77 289 8718: When do we anticipate feed back
09/02/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: The final results will be out with the interview results itself!
09/02/24, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: While I get his test evaluated, I have his interview slots, however before I share the interview slots I would like you, the parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, could you be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
09/02/24, 4:13 pm - +263 77 289 8718: As  l said we are leaving to the village. Unless critical we can hold
09/02/24, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: The discussion will short please!
09/02/24, 4:14 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
09/02/24, 4:14 pm - +263 77 289 8718: OK go ahead
09/02/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: So now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Bukhosi's higher education in India both mentally and financially, please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
09/02/24, 4:15 pm - +263 77 289 8718: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
09/02/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
09/02/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
09/02/24, 4:18 pm - +263 77 289 8718: Yes we do
09/02/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
09/02/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
09/02/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
09/02/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th February 2024 for $200 and the 17th or 18th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

09/02/24, 4:24 pm - +263 77 289 8718: Am asking how do we make payment for 350usd
09/02/24, 4:26 pm - +263 77 772 7249: Do you have a local bank where can deposit or these is another alternative mode of payment
