29/01/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
29/01/24, 5:08 pm - +263 78 220 3030: I am Dennis Chando, a 21 year old man. I am a young man with an ambition to become great, someone who is dedicated to achieve special goals in life.
Academically i had been strong all the way around from my primary to my secondary level. I had limited room for failure, i turned my failures into mistakes so i learned out of them. I had to attain 4As and 4Bs at my Ordinary level, and i tried my best also at Advanced level..
I would like to put my all at Business management.i have faith as a strength, i dont let my fears stop me.

I am from a family of 5. I am the only male, for i am between 2 girls. My father is jobless whilst my mother is a maid in South Africa
29/01/24, 9:07 pm - Harmehak: I was hoping we could connect earlier, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
29/01/24, 9:10 pm - +263 78 220 3030: Ok ma'am

30/01/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
30/01/24, 9:42 am - +263 78 220 3030: Um doing great, thank u
30/01/24, 9:42 am - +263 78 220 3030: Yes we can start
30/01/24, 9:49 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Dennis, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

May I know more about your siblings?
30/01/24, 9:54 am - +263 78 220 3030: Ok, i have 2 siblings. My elder sister is 25 and happily married and the last of us is 17, she's still at her high school level.
30/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
30/01/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Well Dennis now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
30/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 220 3030: I do believe in it, for it is associated with adventurous and life changing activities.
... Higher education abroad is of assured quality and it really helps afterwards.
Education abroad  better than being in here Especially in here, for abroad there is international standardized education, even the facilities are far much improved to meet international requirements. 
Studing abroad is like a dreamed coming true, for i always wanted to attain the best education.
30/01/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: You see, Dennis, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
30/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 78 220 3030: Here things are so challenging, u can get your degree here but you will not get wat you had learned for
30/01/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: I can understand!
30/01/24, 10:49 am - Harmehak: So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Dennis?
30/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 220 3030: Yeah i am mentally prepared, so as  physical me
30/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: Dennis, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
30/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 220 3030: My family members are aware of it, they are also ready to stretch their hands in helping me with all that is required so that i can get higher and better education abroad
30/01/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please!

May I know who would be the one supporting you financially and what profession they are in, Dennis?
30/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 220 3030: My mother, she's a house maid in South Africa. She had been supportive though all my education since my primary levels.. But now my elder sister has been giving a hand too she sells clothes, she owns a small shop
30/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: I do understand,

Did you happen to communicate the same with them as well, Dennis?
30/01/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 220 3030: Yes i did and they indicated that they are willing to stand with me

31/01/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 220 3030: Thank u very much for the knowledge u  shared... Now i have seen much information which is helpful and which is so motivating..
days ago i watched that presentation in which Satya Nadella was delivering Microsoft's earnings
31/01/24, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Thats great, Dennis and I am glad the information intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
31/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 78 220 3030: I am not that familiar with it, since it is higher education with quality it is expensive but with the aid of a scholarship it will be affordable to low income earners
31/01/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: I do understand!
31/01/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
31/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
31/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 78 220 3030: Thank u very much for the explanation. Now I understand why it is of greater importance to be in the Edoofa program.. It helps in giving affordable education to international students <This message was edited>
31/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: I appreciate Dennis!
31/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: In simple words Dennis, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
31/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
31/01/24, 11:59 am - +27 64 814 8463: Noted .
31/01/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: I am glad that you are following the discussion! <This message was edited>
31/01/24, 12:00 pm - +27 64 814 8463: I have a question , let's say the child get the opportunity to study or gets the scholarship ,how do we pay , are we going to pay the full amount once or pay in installments
31/01/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Let me help you have a better clarity!
31/01/24, 12:01 pm - +27 64 814 8463: Thank you
31/01/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Now you see Mrs Rosemary, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1800, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $900 in the first semester and $900 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!

31/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: What else would you like to ask please?
31/01/24, 12:05 pm - +27 64 814 8463: Need to know more
31/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Yes please? <This message was edited>
31/01/24, 12:06 pm - +27 64 814 8463: How about the visa and ticket.
31/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: The Visa fee is a one time payment of $85.
31/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$490, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August this year as per your preparations
31/01/24, 12:07 pm - +27 64 814 8463: Thank u
31/01/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Rosemary and Dennis, from Mr Piyush's experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
31/01/24, 12:10 pm - +27 64 814 8463: Ok I understand now.
31/01/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
31/01/24, 12:11 pm - +27 64 814 8463: Yes
31/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: So now given the finances in India!

Are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India please?
31/01/24, 12:13 pm - +27 64 814 8463: Yes thank you
31/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 220 3030: U can share
31/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
31/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
31/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
31/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

31/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 220 3030: The EWYL is so helpful for i can see that it helps in the installation of business and work experiences
31/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Indeed Dennis!
31/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
31/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 220 3030: This is of greatness, it make students to work very hard and it also help indirectly to those who are havin challenges in paying the tuition. the EWYL is one of a kind
31/01/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Dennis
31/01/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

31/01/24, 2:03 pm - +263 78 220 3030: So u can earn as much as u want frome the EWYL
31/01/24, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

Your credits would depend on your hardwork itself.
31/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 78 220 3030: Oooh ok ma'am
31/01/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
31/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 220 3030: Yes i am
31/01/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Dennis, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
31/01/24, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
31/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 78 220 3030: 1500 to 2250
31/01/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
31/01/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
31/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 78 220 3030: Ohk so how is it paid.. What is it with the rounds
31/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
31/01/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: It is paid after you are found eligible through online banking modes.
31/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 220 3030: Oh ok
31/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 78 220 3030: Yeah i do
31/01/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
31/01/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
31/01/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
31/01/24, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same Dennis?
31/01/24, 3:34 pm - +27 64 814 8463: Noted thanks
31/01/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome!
31/01/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
31/01/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
31/01/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
31/01/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed, Mrs Rosemary?
31/01/24, 4:31 pm - +27 64 814 8463: Yes following
31/01/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
31/01/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
31/01/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
31/01/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 4:37 pm - +27 64 814 8463: So u have to renew the visa yearly
31/01/24, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: It's renewed only once after one year!
31/01/24, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
31/01/24, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

31/01/24, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!
31/01/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
31/01/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
31/01/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

01/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 220 3030: We have discussion was very helpful, we haf time to evaluate the points and the program that Edoofa is offering. In conclusion we managed to see that, surely Edoofa makes education affordable especially to international students, this we have seen it through the EWYL system which even helps students and the fees structures are so acceptable and affordable. 

The value of one's career after studying in India is of good quality since India is one of the countries which have th  best education systems in the world
01/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to see that you had a thorough discussion, Dennis!

So far, what all would you like to ask please?

01/02/24, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
01/02/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 220 3030: Is Edoofa for certain institutes or u cover all the nation
01/02/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. *Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries.*
01/02/24, 1:16 pm - +263 78 220 3030: Oooh ok thank you
01/02/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: What else would you like to ask please?
01/02/24, 1:48 pm - +263 78 220 3030: The program again will help for one's attachment right
01/02/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: A university provides the opportunity for attachment to the student provided the student is active during his course duration and is attending his classes.

Along with the same the student can also ask his EWYL mentor to help him with attachment and mentor would guide accordingly to gain work experience please.
01/02/24, 2:35 pm - +263 78 220 3030: Ooh ok
Thank u very much
01/02/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Have you and your parent already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
01/02/24, 3:08 pm - +27 64 814 8463: Yes I did talk to her
01/02/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Thats good, Mrs Rosemary!
01/02/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
01/02/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

02/02/24, 10:05 am - +27 64 814 8463: Yes I am .
02/02/24, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Thats great,

As of now, would you like to ask anything?
02/02/24, 10:27 am - +27 64 814 8463: Mayb later
02/02/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
02/02/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the shared video, Mrs Rosemary?
02/02/24, 11:05 am - +27 64 814 8463: Yes I dd
02/02/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: So Mrs Rosemary, are you willing to support Dennis for his higher education with Edoofa so that he can also be a part of such events in Zimbabwe and later on in India?
02/02/24, 11:28 am - +27 64 814 8463: Yes I'm .
02/02/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Alright please.
02/02/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
02/02/24, 1:49 pm - +27 64 814 8463: 1 Business management
2 India
3, from $6000_$8000 
4.between $2000_$3000 
5. $350 _$450 
6 .7 days
7. Yes .
02/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Mrs Rosemary.

However for answer 5 it's only 350.
02/02/24, 1:53 pm - +27 64 814 8463: Ok thank you
02/02/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: So Mrs Rosemary, now that you are aware of the entire process and the finances,

Are you willing to support Dennis's higher education in India both mentally and financially?

If so, kindly acknowledge the same using a voice note.
02/02/24, 2:07 pm - +27 64 814 8463: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
02/02/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
02/02/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
02/02/24, 2:22 pm - +27 64 814 8463: Yes as I said , Im will to give him all the support he needs.
02/02/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
02/02/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
02/02/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
02/02/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 9th or 10th February 2024 for $200 and the 9th or 10th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 9th or 10th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
02/02/24, 2:46 pm - +27 64 814 8463: If he eligible I will go with 1
02/02/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

Are you financially prepared for the Option 1 as well?

If so, kindly acknowledge using voice note.
02/02/24, 2:51 pm - +27 64 814 8463: <Media omitted>
