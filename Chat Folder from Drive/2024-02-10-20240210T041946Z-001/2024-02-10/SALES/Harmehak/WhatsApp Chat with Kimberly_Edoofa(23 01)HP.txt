23/01/24, 7:33 pm - +263 77 470 4921: wow I'm a huge fan of chess and thank you for a broader insight of the place I'm aspiring to live in
23/01/24, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
23/01/24, 8:01 pm - +263 77 470 4921: yes l did all of them
23/01/24, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Thats good!
23/01/24, 8:04 pm - +263 77 470 4921: umm it ranges from $7000-$8000 per year
23/01/24, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Kimberly!
23/01/24, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/01/24, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/01/24, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/01/24, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: I was hoping we could continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
23/01/24, 9:13 pm - +263 77 470 4921: ohhhh ok
23/01/24, 9:16 pm - +263 77 470 4921: ok noted
24/01/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
24/01/24, 9:35 am - +263 77 470 4921: yes sure
24/01/24, 9:37 am - Harmehak: In simple words Kimberly, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 9:37 am - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
24/01/24, 9:41 am - +263 77 470 4921: oh yes l totally agree and understand and l think that's fair enough
24/01/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
24/01/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
24/01/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
24/01/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

24/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 470 4921: oh that's inspirational
24/01/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 470 4921: following
24/01/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: So what are your thoughts on the Earn While You Learn Program, Kimberly?
24/01/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 470 4921: l think it's quite motivational consideing the credits you get  and boosting your skills and it gives a practical experience for people like me who might want to pursue marketing or anything along the lines
24/01/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Kimberly.
24/01/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/01/24, 10:04 am - +263 77 470 4921: wow that would make everything a lot easier
24/01/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Kimberly
24/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

24/01/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
24/01/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 470 4921: for now no
24/01/24, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Alright please
24/01/24, 10:29 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
24/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 77 470 4921: yes
24/01/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Kimberly, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
24/01/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 470 4921: ranges from $1500-$2250
24/01/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
24/01/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
24/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 470 4921: ok following
24/01/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
24/01/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 470 4921: yes it's making everything easier
24/01/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
24/01/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/01/24, 10:51 am - +263 77 470 4921: ok so what about the application fee
24/01/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
24/01/24, 11:20 am - +263 77 470 4921: l mean when you are submitting the application letter , what's the fee
24/01/24, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the same please?

$350 is inclusive of application fee.
24/01/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Once you are a part of the program after being found eligible, you would begin with your admissions process,

The admission officer would guide you with the same.
24/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 77 470 4921: ohh
24/01/24, 11:32 am - +263 77 470 4921: ok now l understand
24/01/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
24/01/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
24/01/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
24/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 470 4921: yes its all clear
24/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
24/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

24/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 77 470 4921: ok
24/01/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
24/01/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

24/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well as with Kelvin, Kimberly!
24/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 77 470 4921: ok
24/01/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: As of now, do you have any queries, Kimberly?
24/01/24, 1:19 pm - +263 77 470 4921: not yet
24/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
24/01/24, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
24/01/24, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
24/01/24, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

24/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 470 4921: thank you and same to you
24/01/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Thank you Kimberly
25/01/24, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Good Morning, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
25/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 77 470 4921: sure
25/01/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: So how was your discussion with your parents, Kimberly?

What all did you discuss with them?
25/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 470 4921: we just discussed some of these questions
25/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Thats great!

So far, what all would you or your parents like to ask?
25/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 77 470 4921: umm for now there's nothing
25/01/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Alright please
25/01/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
25/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 470 4921: yes indeed you people are transforming people's lives
25/01/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words!

Did your parents connect with Mrs Ruth as well as Kelvin, Kimberly?
25/01/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 470 4921: not yet something came up but l will do it soon
25/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: I understand!
25/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
25/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 470 4921: l want to express my sincere gratitude for your time and consideration of my application.  While I am honored and forever grateful to have been considered for your scholarship  I've decided to pursue other opportunities that are a better fit for my current situation.  I appreciate your support and understanding and most importantly your time during the past days we were in touch
25/01/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: May I know what exactly happened so suddenly, Kimberly?
25/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 77 470 4921: l have had some recent developments in my life that have led me to reevaluate my priorities and goals.  While your scholarship is an incredible opportunity, I've decided that it's not the right fit for me at this time.  I truly appreciate your consideration
25/01/24, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand Kimberly!

I believe you were aware of the entire process and discussion along with the finances since the beginning, isn't it?
25/01/24, 12:27 pm - +263 77 470 4921: yes l was and l hope l didn't come as rude to break it off when we were almost done l didn't want to waste your time further
25/01/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: If such was the case Kimberly, may I know why you proceeded ahead with your application itself?
25/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 470 4921: l thought we could afford all the expenses were to come but looking at things as they are l don't think we could
25/01/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Didn't you happen to discuss the same with your parents when you applied Kimberly?

As I believe you knew every expense before we even begun with our discussion.
25/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 470 4921: yes  we had and we thought by the time the application process commences we would be able to afford it but something happened and I'm sorry for any inconveniences I might have caused
25/01/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Kindly share with honesty as what exactly happened in a few days, Kimberly?

I believe you were showing dishonesty since the beginning in that case, isn't it?

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I have been expecting proper participation, for your application for Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
