08/02/24, 9:47 am - +263 71 358 2853: I know Edoofa stands for education for all and that's why she told me about Edoofa so that,like everyone else who has got a chance to study in India with the help of Edoofa ,l also get it too...l learnt that edoofa provides quality education for those who wish to advance in their studies and that it also provides the education at an affordable fee
08/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
08/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
08/02/24, 10:10 am - +263 71 358 2853: I appreciate you sharing this with me
08/02/24, 10:11 am - +263 71 358 2853: I can see Edoofa is a widely known schoolarship programme
08/02/24, 10:19 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
08/02/24, 10:19 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
08/02/24, 10:20 am - +263 71 358 2853: Yes ...indeed Ms Harmehak
08/02/24, 10:21 am - +263 71 358 2853: It would be my greatest pleasure if l get this opportunity
08/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Bornwell, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Tsholotsho High School charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
08/02/24, 10:52 am - +263 71 358 2853: My full name is Bornwell Wayne Ndlovu,l'm 17 years old ,l recently completed my A'level at Tsholotsho High school at a cost of $490 USD every term and l also learnt and completed my O'level at Tsholotsho High school but at a different cost of $450 USD every term ,l wish to study chemical engineering ..My strengths in my school work is in biology n my weakness is in Mathematics but l pushed hard on it and passed it both on O and A'level.l like sketching and drawing during my spare time ,l was born with this gift and l've been doing it since l was a kid.l grew up living at Tsholotsho centre with my mother,father ,little brother who is currently on form one and my little sister who is on grade one.My father is a Game ranger who works under an organization called CAMPFIRE and my mother is an entrepreneur who owns a small retail shop.The highest education level for both my mother and father is O'level

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
08/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 71 358 2853: They are aware of it ..actually they were the first ones to know when l submitted my application
08/02/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful!
08/02/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: So, can you share your O and A Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study chemical engineering?
08/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 71 358 2853: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 71 358 2853: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 71 358 2853: The world is a changing place and l've always been intrigued on the mechanism behind how everything works in this morden world and l feel like chemical engineering is the best way to fullfil my curiosity and desire ,l really wish to know how nanotechnology works and operates on humans so studying chemical engineering would satisfy my passion on medicine work
08/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
08/02/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Bornwell, while I understand what you are sharing,

I can see you didn't manage to clear Chemistry, may I know more regarding the same?
08/02/24, 12:08 pm - +263 71 358 2853: I pushed hard on chemistry but due to the lack of time n dedication by my chemistry teacher l ended up not clearing it
08/02/24, 12:09 pm - +263 71 358 2853: I would like to know if it is a prime subject in this course or not
08/02/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
08/02/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: It is, please!
08/02/24, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: However I would like to understand from you regarding the requirements of Engineering first, Bornwell!
08/02/24, 12:12 pm - +263 71 358 2853: 3 A'level passes in Maths,biology,chemistry and physics
08/02/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware that Physics is a mandatory requirement to pursue Engineering either in India or Zimbabwe?
08/02/24, 12:13 pm - +263 71 358 2853: With the passes of Maths and biology l would like to know of the courses l'm able to fit in
08/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Yes
08/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Even in chemical engineering also?
08/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 71 358 2853: As l was going through courses that l could do that l like l came across a course called GIS(geographical information systems) and l believe l qualify for this one ,l'm putting it as a second option to chemical engineering if l can't qualify for engineering
08/02/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: We shall discuss!
08/02/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
08/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Ohh so we're off the engineering course
08/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Okay
08/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Physics is a strict requirement.
08/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 71 358 2853: What about the GIS
08/02/24, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Now as per your results, you can pursue either of the following courses under health care sector-

1. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology* <This message was edited>
08/02/24, 12:42 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Let's go with number 2
08/02/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: We will discuss the same in detail.
08/02/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, may I know what motivates you to pursue GIS?
08/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 71 358 2853: The course includes artworks as in map design and analysis
08/02/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Let me provide you a better clarity.
08/02/24, 1:03 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Okay
08/02/24, 1:03 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Go on
08/02/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: A Bachelor in Geography degree can provide a solid foundation for a career in the field of geology. Some of the common career paths for Geography graduates with an interest in geology include:

Geologist: Study the physical characteristics and processes of the Earth, including its rocks, minerals, and oil and gas resources.

Environmental Geologist: Assess and manage the impact of human activities on the environment, such as the impact of mining and oil and gas extraction.

Hydrogeologist: Study the distribution and movement of water underground and on the surface of the Earth.

Petroleum Geologist: Explore for and evaluate oil and gas reserves.

Mining Geologist: Plan and supervise the extraction of minerals and other geological resources.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) Specialist: Use computer software to analyze and visualize geographical data, including geological data.

Geography Professor/Lecturer: Teach and conduct research in geography and related fields, including geology.

These are just a few examples of careers that a Bachelor in Geography degree combined with an interest in geology can lead to. The exact career path will depend on the individual's interests, skills, and experience.
08/02/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: You can follow the same please.
08/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 358 2853: I think in this case microbiology is the way forward
08/02/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the same.
08/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Okay
08/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: *B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.
08/02/24, 1:16 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Thank you
08/02/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Did you have a thorough reading, Bornwell?
08/02/24, 1:19 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Yes and l'm choosing the course
08/02/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!

What would you like to ask as of now, Bornwell?
08/02/24, 1:33 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Sure...So as you have helped me choose a course that l'm going to pursue does that mean Edoofa is taking me in?
08/02/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: We are still in discussion of the process!
08/02/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Alright Bornwell, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
08/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Okay
08/02/24, 1:56 pm - +263 71 358 2853: I see myself graduated and apparently working and earning gud ...Edoofa enables me to achieve my dreams by offering me high quality education which will uplift me academically into a higher level and assisting me in getting a proper job placement by educating me to the best of myself
08/02/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Bornwell, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/02/24, 2:11 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Thank you....I believe studying abroad gives me a chance to get good employment placements and l think it might help to be in a new environment,it might help me to keep my head up straight and focused on what l came for giving me a greater chance of success ... Also due to high inflation percentages in Zimbabwe most people nowadays graduate but not get a proper job placement and they end up struggling in life but l want to be successful so l choose to study abroad because it brings me closer to a good economy and employment opportunities
08/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Bornwell, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 71 358 2853: I certainly do...life in Zimbabwe is becoming more costly daily and l don't want to start with our weak currency which is relentlessly dropping it's value daily
08/02/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
08/02/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: He also had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
08/02/24, 2:24 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Yes ..things are really challenging and the situation of students selling ecocash,simcards and vegetables.. I see it everyday and some of them do all that so as to get money to pay for their semesters in universities and l don't want to end up being in the same scenario so that's why l want yo utilize this opportunity given to me <This message was edited>
08/02/24, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing and I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future,

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

08/02/24, 2:38 pm - +263 71 358 2853: I know India has a diverse and broad international community which becomes good for us as international students because it becomes easier for one to fit in such kind of a community and it provides high quality education on cheap tuition fees..l heard that if u become a good student they pay you while learning and after you graduate they provide a job placement locally
08/02/24, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your knowledge!

08/02/24, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
08/02/24, 3:03 pm - +263 71 358 2853: No we are not unfortunately
08/02/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/02/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/02/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/02/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/02/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 3:13 pm - +263 71 358 2853: It seems good and affordable <This message was edited>
08/02/24, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
08/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 358 2853: I think this program is very good especially to us international students who do not have any family in India who will support them in terms of daily needs ...how do you obtain or get added to this program
08/02/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Every student gets the opportunity to be a part of the *Earn While You Learn Program*!
08/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 358 2853: What about working and learning at the same time ..do you get an exception or not
08/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: Sure, let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
08/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/02/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 358 2853: This is very good l must say
08/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
08/02/24, 3:38 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/02/24, 3:40 pm - +263 71 358 2853: So do you choose a project to work on or you're given
08/02/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: You would be choosing,

You would be alloted a dedicated mentor while you are still in Zimbabwe,

You would be discussing the same with your mentor in detail too!
08/02/24, 3:45 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Ohh so it starts before l even start doing my course
08/02/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

If all goes well you would begin with your EWYL Program while you are still in Zimbabwe within February please.
08/02/24, 3:51 pm - +263 71 358 2853: That's really great
08/02/24, 3:51 pm - +263 71 358 2853: I'm so excited
08/02/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
08/02/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/02/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Wow this is so great
08/02/24, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
08/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 71 358 2853: I really like what l have learnt about Edoofa so far
08/02/24, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Yes indeed l do
08/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
08/02/24, 4:05 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Yes
08/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Bornwell as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
08/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/02/24, 4:09 pm - +263 71 358 2853: A minimum of $1500 and a maximum of $2250
08/02/24, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/02/24, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/02/24, 4:17 pm - +263 71 358 2853: That's great so if l pay the fee do l have the guarantee that l will enroll
08/02/24, 4:19 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/02/24, 4:24 pm - +263 71 358 2853: I do and l believe it's good <This message was edited>
08/02/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/02/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/02/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/02/24, 4:29 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Good so when do l expect the letter to come in or not <This message was edited>
08/02/24, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: After your interview!
08/02/24, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/02/24, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
08/02/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/02/24, 4:35 pm - +263 71 358 2853: You mean this interview
08/02/24, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: This is counseling session please.
08/02/24, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: You can refer to this image too!
08/02/24, 4:37 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Yes l do
08/02/24, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: That's good!
08/02/24, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/02/24, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
08/02/24, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
08/02/24, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

08/02/24, 4:57 pm - +263 71 358 2853: I would like to ask one more thing on the stages taking place on the Edoofa cycle <This message was edited>
08/02/24, 4:59 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Is there an interval of days according to stages or the next stage commences after the other is done
08/02/24, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: While the stage 2 would commerce tomorrow,

The further stages will commence as per the preparations!
08/02/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well.
08/02/24, 5:21 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Okay
08/02/24, 5:21 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/02/24, 5:21 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/02/24, 5:21 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

TOPIC: Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient?

Africa is mostly a very hot and dry continent. Farmers of Africa grow drought resistant crops due to that weather conditions encountered by the place. Most of the crops do not make it out of the season,they wilt and die because of the unfavorable conditions like high temperatures and less rainfall. Most African homes have poor diets due to the lack of nutritious crop produce from their farms and also due to consuming similar meals on daily basis. Poor economic development and stability causes some African to collapse prior to hunger and poverty. Agrarian economies in Africa are unable to produce unable to produce efficient farm produce due to the unsupportive climatic factors. Maize,sorghum and millet are the most grown crops in Africa due to their ability to resist drought,pests and diseases. However these crops are not highly nutritious thus causing many Africans to have poor diets in their homes as these crops are the most consumed food crops in their homes. Poor diets might cause deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkor and scavy,that is why you are able you find a high  percentage of African children affected by such diseases which proves this theory correct.
African farms also do not produce high in nutrient crop yields because of the lack of money or capital to invest in their farms,these investments include implementation of high definition irrigation and purchasing of farm implements like disc plough,planter and combine harvester. This could increase the quality of food they eat at homes and balance out the diet but because of lack of money due to some economic struggles the Africans do not have such equipment and they end up eating unhealthy and poor diets. However it is not the case for all Africans that they have poor dieting in their homes. Some Africans especially those who live in urban areas,they do not entirely depend on agriculture to put a plate of food on the table. Some Africans are financially independent and they live a healthy life with a balanced diet as they eat different kinds of food on daily basis that offer different kinds of nutrients.People who live in urban areas might also be affected by deficiency diseases  due to the unhealthy lifestyle they live,that is eating junk food continuously on daily basis,such food can cause diseases such as heart disease,pulmonary diseases and obesity. This in other words shows that other African who live a lavish lifestyle in urban areas can have a poor diet in their homes too due to too much junk food. This therefore proves that a larger portion of Africans are affected by poor diets and the other portion left are the ones with a good diet.

I grew up in Tsholotsho centre and went to a nearby pre-school called Thabisa pre-school ,l graduated and went on to Mvundlana primary school. I didn't have much to offer l was just a normal student and l was not a prefect in my school from grade one up to grade seven. I was not so intelligent but at the same time l was not dull. Things started to change as l went up the next level,starting from grade five. l became very sharp at school and one day l was awarded an award for totalizing a General paper examination. I was also surprised as everyone else and l was so excited about what was happening in my life. I went to Tsholotsho high school for form one up to six and l was on the first class. When l was in form five l was elected to become a school prefect, l was so happy and l had never been a prefect before. It seemed like new things were being introduced into my life and by the grace of the lord God it seems like something new is being introduced into my life today. In my whole life l had never been out of the country or travelled to other countries but today l got the chance to make it happen with the help of the almighty and Edoofa.l hope this opportunity does not go to waste. I wish to advance my education overseas, see the outside world and also get a proper job placement. <This message was edited>

09/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Okay
09/02/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Bornwell, While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
09/02/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Okay
09/02/24, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

Could you please check with your parents?
09/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 71 304 9009: Afternoon l 'm his mother l'm available
09/02/24, 3:31 pm - +263 71 358 2853: Okay l have
09/02/24, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: Ma'am, I believe you must have followed the entire discussion so far!

So now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Bornwell's higher education in India both mentally and financially, please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!

09/02/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
09/02/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
09/02/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
09/02/24, 3:50 pm - +263 71 304 9009: Yes l am willing to support my son to the fullest just like l did before <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
09/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
09/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
09/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th February 2024 for $200 and the 17th or 18th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
09/02/24, 4:00 pm - +263 71 304 9009: I choose 1
09/02/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

09/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, I do appreciate your support for Bornwell,

So the available slot for the interview with the Program Director for tomorrow is of 12 PM CAT and 12:30 PM CAT.

While you would have a short video call of 5-10 minutes with the Director, Bornwell will be going through the interview using voice notes!

May I know which slot shall I reserve for you?
