08/02/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Well received, Tadiwanashe, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/02/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

08/02/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?

08/02/24, 12:28 pm - +263 78 128 2028: 85 usd
08/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

08/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 78 128 2028: ok l will
08/02/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Haven't you discussed with them already please?
08/02/24, 12:39 pm - +263 78 128 2028: l have and they said they will support any decision l make and they  support my dreams
08/02/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate the same,

Are they willing to support your higher education financially as well please?
08/02/24, 12:59 pm - +263 78 128 2028: we are not wealth but they if they can afford it they will support  but if its beyond their capabilities  it will be hard
08/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
08/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwanashe, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/02/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 128 2028: yes its true
08/02/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
08/02/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Now given the finances are less than those in Zimbabwe,

Are your parents willing to support you financially?
08/02/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 128 2028: yes they are
08/02/24, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please!
08/02/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: So, can you share your O and A Level results in a picturec format with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study engineering programs?
08/02/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 128 2028: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 128 2028: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
08/02/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: I await your remaining response!
08/02/24, 3:05 pm - +263 78 128 2028: our country zimbabwe is far behind in technology so l would like to play a pivotal role in the advancement of my country
08/02/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand!

So may I know what all did you research regarding the requirements for engineering programs, Tadiwanashe?
08/02/24, 3:31 pm - +263 78 128 2028: there is need for 5 o levels and A level passes
08/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: A level passes in which subjects please?
08/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
08/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
08/02/24, 5:41 pm - +263 78 128 2028: pure maths and Computer science
09/02/24, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
09/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: To pursue Engineering even in Zimbabwe, you need physics please!
09/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 128 2028: l don't have Physics at A level but l have it at O level
09/02/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: I understand, however, to pursue Engineering in Zimbabwe or in India, you need physics in A level, Tadiwanashe!
09/02/24, 4:35 pm - +263 78 128 2028: its ok mam
09/02/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwanashe, may I know which field of engineering were you inclined towards?
09/02/24, 4:35 pm - +263 78 128 2028: Computer engineering
09/02/24, 4:42 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Now since you already understand that Physics is a mandatory requirement for Engineering!

Considering your interests and subject combination, you can pursue Bachelors in Computer Applications, the sam would cater for your interests itself!

Shall I brief you about the same?
09/02/24, 4:42 pm - +263 78 128 2028: yes
09/02/24, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Computer Application* course graduates have a variety of career options after completion of the course.

09/02/24, 4:57 pm - +263 78 128 2028: ok
09/02/24, 5:01 pm - +263 78 128 2028: its brilliant
09/02/24, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same itself?
09/02/24, 5:21 pm - +263 78 128 2028: yes
09/02/24, 5:21 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Tadiwanashe, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
09/02/24, 5:23 pm - +263 78 128 2028: after 5 years l see my self as a great man recognised in my country and around the world . Edoofa is an essential key to my success
09/02/24, 5:25 pm - Harmehak: That is great Tadiwanashe, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
09/02/24, 5:27 pm - +263 78 128 2028: technology in my country have not advanced compared to other countries and university in my country have poor rankings
09/02/24, 5:27 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tadiwanashe, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
09/02/24, 5:29 pm - +263 78 128 2028: yes it true
09/02/24, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Tadiwanashe.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
09/02/24, 5:33 pm - +263 78 128 2028: india is the fourth best represented nation in 2024 and it moved from  sixth in2023
09/02/24, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:
