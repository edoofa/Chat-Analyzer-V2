07/02/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
07/02/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: Katelyn, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Tafadzwa!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
07/02/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Okay  Edoofa scholarship program is offering 50% to 100 % scholarships on tuition fees ..Edoofa scholarship program also offers learners to work while pursuing their studies which is a total advantage because currently here in Zim after graduating people are struggling to find jobs
07/02/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Katelyn, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/02/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
07/02/24, 2:54 pm - +263 78 062 9603: I would be grateful if I happen to attain a scholarship from your program and become part of the Edoofian family ...I have seen that you are working hand in hand with different institutions here in Zimbabwe
07/02/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Katelyn!
07/02/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Katelyn, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Highfield 1 High charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
07/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 062 9603: I'm Katelyn Mazitulela and I'm a girl aged 20 .Done with my A level in 2022 .Well when I was at Highfield high 1 we used to pay $100 USD .I can not technically say I'm intelligent but I thrive hard in order for me to pass and achieve my dreams .I wish to venture in the field of social work because I feel that were my passion is .As for my strengths I believe I'm a hard worker and I'm goal oriented .As for my weakness ,lack of funding is pulling me down to achieve my goals.I love reading books ,doing researchs on the field of social sciences and also I love playing tennis .
07/02/24, 3:18 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Well growing up wasn't easy for me as  the economy of Zimbabwe wasn't favorable.My dad doesn't go to work he does part time jobs here and there and my mom teaches at a preschool.We are 3  kids in our family and meeting demands of each one of us isn't easy as there is no  money ...Both my parents reached O level and they passed but couldn't go further with their studies because if various reasons I don't know
07/02/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Katelyn, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
07/02/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Pleasure is mine
07/02/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Well Katelyn, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
07/02/24, 4:35 pm - +263 78 062 9603: In my views learning abroad is very life changing because these institutions there got better facilities  and sometimes you might be working while learning to gain experience
07/02/24, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct,

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
07/02/24, 5:04 pm - +263 78 062 9603: I'm more than prepared  ...if its anything to do with my life I'm prepared for anything
07/02/24, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: Katelyn, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
07/02/24, 6:47 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Both my parents are aware and I've shared my views and thoughts and they are in full support of this . They are willing to support me mentally but financially its hard that's is why im in need of a scholarship
07/02/24, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: I do understand the financial challenges as you happened to mention earlier as well Katelyn!

May I know who has been supporting you with your education so far?
07/02/24, 7:17 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Well my parents have been supporting me. They would do part payments sometimes I would end up having debts
07/02/24, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand,

May I know regarding your financial planning for your higher education?

Would you agree that it would require financial support?
07/02/24, 7:20 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Didn't get you here financial planning as in?
07/02/24, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Would you agree that higher education would require financial support?
07/02/24, 7:24 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Okay now I understand . I do agree  because it requires a lot of things for example accommodation and laptops to do researchs
07/02/24, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: Correct!

Now considering that you would require financial support,

What is your financial planning for your higher education?
07/02/24, 7:58 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Well there are a lot of things to consider first the cost of tuition,cost of books,accomodation transport
07/02/24, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, so who would be the one supporting you financially please?
07/02/24, 8:06 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Well now I do not have a sponsor but my parents are aware of this journey
07/02/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: So are they willing to assist you financially?

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
08/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 062 9603: I'm sorry for the delay we may start
08/02/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: I understand please!
08/02/24, 12:04 pm - +263 78 595 0122: Edoofa is a scholarship program that helps young people achieve their goals
08/02/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
08/02/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 595 0122: Higher education requires  a lot of things there it needs someone who is fanancially stable but in  our case we are not,that's why we are seeking for a scholarship so that she can advance her education
08/02/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: I understand please!
08/02/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Katelyn, kindly address the following questions as per your learning. 

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
08/02/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Okay Edoofa program is a well appreciated program offering 50% to 100% scholarships on the African continent and the SAARC nations ...it also offers students to work while learning .
08/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 78 062 9603: The program  helps people with financial need from 50 to 100 % depending with your situation
08/02/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Received, Katelyn!

Did you thoroughly read the document?
08/02/24, 12:28 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Sorry I could not finish reading but I'm on it now
08/02/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/02/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Edoofa is  a program which shows  years of dedication of its  founder towards solving two most important problems which are lack of affordability and employability...Edoofa is also moving fast in its digital era  and students not only need to prepare for jobs but the future and this can happen through experience
08/02/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: That's correct!

Did you understand the following aspect as well?
08/02/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/02/24, 1:10 pm - +263 78 062 9603: On the financial aspect most people assume that scholarships are charitable things given to people but that's not the case and Edoofa is not a charitable organization but Edoofa is a social ,for profit organization aimed to help deserving students with life changing opportunities to further their careers
08/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 78 062 9603: I understand
08/02/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you have a better clarity.
08/02/24, 1:13 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Thank you
08/02/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Katelyn, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/02/24, 1:16 pm - +263 78 062 9603: I would agree .The cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high and  most of us can not afford it
08/02/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
08/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: So what is your take on the costs of education after the Edoofa scholarship program for education in India?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program!
08/02/24, 1:26 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Edoofa makes higher education affordable because college fees have been reduced  and students can earn while learning to pay for the next semester..this makes higher education affordable
08/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!

Did you discuss the same with your parents too, Katelyn?
08/02/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Yes ma'am
08/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Are they willing to support you financially given the costs?
08/02/24, 1:53 pm - +263 78 062 9603: I believe so
08/02/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Can you elaborate?
08/02/24, 2:06 pm - +263 78 062 9603: Okay .Both my parents are willing to help me financially
08/02/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Can they please participate and acknowledge the same?
08/02/24, 2:36 pm - +263 78 595 0122: Yes we are
08/02/24, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
09/02/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/02/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 062 9603: Yes ma'am
09/02/24, 9:54 am - Harmehak: I am expecting to hear from Mr Brighton as well, Katelyn!
09/02/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 062 9603: Ooooh okay let me inform him
09/02/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Sure please!
09/02/24, 11:10 am - +263 78 062 9603: He said he is busy now but will get  touch when he is free ma'am
09/02/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: I am expecting to hear from him regarding his acknowledgement itself!
