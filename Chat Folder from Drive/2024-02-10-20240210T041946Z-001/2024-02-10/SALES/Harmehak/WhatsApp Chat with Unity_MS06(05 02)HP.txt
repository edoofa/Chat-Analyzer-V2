06/02/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 169 2204: well ma'am l choose Law
06/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright Unity, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

06/02/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Unity, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/02/24, 3:44 pm - +263 77 169 2204: ma'am the information on becoming a judge lacks the yrs needed to complete the course
06/02/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam.
06/02/24, 3:51 pm - +263 77 169 2204: well ma'am honestly speaking l believe that by studying abroad l will get the best education and not only that lam also believe that getting a job with a good salary won't be difficult unlike in my country and above all becoming one of the Edoofa students will ease the burden of money of my parents shoulders
06/02/24, 3:51 pm - +263 77 169 2204: ooh noted
06/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: You see, Unity, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
06/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 77 169 2204: yuh ma'am things are getting hard day by day
06/02/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: I understand, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Unity.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

06/02/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Unity!
06/02/24, 4:13 pm - +263 77 169 2204: Am Unity's mother, Agness Sigauke.  Am 38 years old  with one daughter as a second wife to Kudakwashe Sithole. Am a house wife. I compliment my husband to raise fees for my daughter hoping she will achieve her goals. Will be grateful if she get the scholarship. Please consider my daughter's submission.  Thanks
06/02/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your participation, Mrs Agness!

Its a pleasure to know more about you!
06/02/24, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: We surely look forward to the same!
06/02/24, 5:00 pm - +263 77 445 3185: We want ladies too madam to top CEO. Observations
06/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
06/02/24, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
06/02/24, 5:02 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Will check and update madam. Thanks
06/02/24, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: While I understand!
06/02/24, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/02/24, 5:06 pm - +263 77 445 3185: At the moment  no madam
06/02/24, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/02/24, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/02/24, 5:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 5:08 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Noted. I understand
06/02/24, 5:09 pm - +263 77 445 3185: This good. I appreciate
06/02/24, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Sithole, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/02/24, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
06/02/24, 5:15 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Noted. Is it for a semester or for the course.  Also, is there option of instalments payments,,,?
06/02/24, 5:17 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Because what is important for is for me to plan for such costs and also to know the deadlines payment for August intake.
06/02/24, 5:18 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Where there is a will there is a way.
06/02/24, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your thoughts!
06/02/24, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: Let me provide you a better clarity.
06/02/24, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: Now you see Mr Sithole, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1800, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $900 in the first semester and $900 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
06/02/24, 6:06 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Noted Ms Harmehak. Will see as we go. Thanks
06/02/24, 6:08 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
06/02/24, 6:08 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/02/24, 6:08 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/02/24, 6:08 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

06/02/24, 7:31 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Noted
06/02/24, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/02/24, 7:34 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Awesome,  hardworking will pay there
06/02/24, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
06/02/24, 7:38 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/02/24, 7:48 pm - +263 77 445 3185: What we are expecting her to do.
06/02/24, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: We do look forward to her performing well in the Earn While You Learn Program.
06/02/24, 7:55 pm - +263 77 445 3185: That will great and I think from our discussions here she has learned a lot and she should work towards achievements
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that.
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - +263 77 445 3185: I have also learned a lot here incumbent Agness.  The good thing is we all have any in sight about this scholarship
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 8:00 pm - +263 77 445 3185: True this has been very vital discussions to be honest and on of its mankind. Thanks
06/02/24, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
06/02/24, 8:02 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Ready
06/02/24, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: Mr Sithole, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
06/02/24, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/02/24, 8:08 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Sychatrictric test. It will be between 1500 us-2250 us
06/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
06/02/24, 8:10 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Noted
06/02/24, 8:11 pm - +263 77 445 3185: That's great.
06/02/24, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/02/24, 8:13 pm - +263 77 445 3185: From our discussions I think so
06/02/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/02/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/02/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/02/24, 8:16 pm - +263 77 445 3185: True and this arrangement is affordable
06/02/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
06/02/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/02/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
06/02/24, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/02/24, 8:18 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Yes thanks
06/02/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/02/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
06/02/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

06/02/24, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/02/24, 8:24 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

06/02/24, 8:30 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Will do thanks
06/02/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
06/02/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/02/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

06/02/24, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: Dear Parents and Unity,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “07-02-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
07/02/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
07/02/24, 12:46 pm - +263 77 445 3185: We are well. Thanks
07/02/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
07/02/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: So how was your discussion as a family?

What all did you discuss please?
07/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Unity was in a jovial mood to go to India. Also, we discussed about the payments as per your proposed payment plan.  We agreed to start looking for the funds required per given time line. Thanks
07/02/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Mr Sithole!
07/02/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: May I know which timeline are your referring to please?
07/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 77 445 3185: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/02/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?

The fee is paid in two installments where the first payment is made within 7 days, if Unity is accepted into the program and happens to receive an Acceptence letter please!
07/02/24, 1:30 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Yes
07/02/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: What else would you like to ask regarding the same please?
07/02/24, 2:25 pm - +263 77 445 3185: It's fine as of now. Thanks
07/02/24, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
07/02/24, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
07/02/24, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: Mr Sithole, Mrs Agness and Unity, Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
07/02/24, 8:00 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Will do.
07/02/24, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: Haven't you been able to connect already?
07/02/24, 8:45 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Sorry late reply. Am working on that tirelessly. Its only that most of time is driving as of now
07/02/24, 8:45 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please!
07/02/24, 8:45 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Kindly be patient with me
07/02/24, 8:46 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Thanks
07/02/24, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Mr Sithole!

Meanwhile, Unity can participate in the discussion as well!
07/02/24, 8:56 pm - +263 77 169 2204: okay ma'am lam connecting with her
07/02/24, 8:57 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
08/02/24, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start?
08/02/24, 10:06 am - +263 77 445 3185: Morning. Am well too.
08/02/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
08/02/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 445 3185: Inspiration. Watched it.
08/02/24, 10:23 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that please!
08/02/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: So Unity, now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
08/02/24, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting your response, Unity!
08/02/24, 7:02 pm - +263 77 169 2204: okay ma'am l came to a conclusion that l will be doing Law in india
08/02/24, 7:09 pm - +263 77 169 2204: if found eligible parents can complete a part of $200 USD in 7 days
08/02/24, 7:23 pm - +263 77 169 2204: and the annual fee is $2000_$3000 USD also the enrollment fee is $350 ,also the fees without a scholarship is $6000_$8000 USD
09/02/24, 8:23 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the key to unlocking the world. It is the passport to freedom.” ---- Oprah Winfrey*

With all positive energy, I am here to engage in a discussion!
09/02/24, 8:50 am - +263 77 445 3185: Morning Morning. Sorry for late responding. Am currently in Mozambique.
09/02/24, 8:51 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
09/02/24, 8:52 am - Harmehak: Correct answers, Unity!
09/02/24, 8:52 am - Harmehak: Mr Sithole, So now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Untiy's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
09/02/24, 8:53 am - +263 77 445 3185: But am reachable
09/02/24, 8:53 am - Harmehak: Duly noted. <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting your response, Mr Sithole.
09/02/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Sorry I'll reply soon madam am travelling from mozambique to Zimbabwe. Once am a bit free will reply.
09/02/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

You can address if you are willing to support Untiy's higher education in India both mentally and financially, given the finances and the entire details of the program?
09/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Am 100% behind my daughter Unity. Am securing work in Mozambique for her support. Please kindly accept her. Will be greatful.
09/02/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
09/02/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
09/02/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
09/02/24, 1:59 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Yes as has been in secondary education. Thanks
09/02/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
09/02/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
09/02/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
09/02/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th or 18th February 2024 for $200 and the 17th or 18th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th or 18th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
09/02/24, 2:03 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Very correct. But for me it's education first , health and food. Thanks
09/02/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Not at the moment but I secured a well paying job in Mozambique and am likely going to start anytime around that deadline date.
09/02/24, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
09/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Can negotiate any advance with my employer if successful will be able to do so.
09/02/24, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please!
09/02/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 445 3185: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Today itself,  *Mapepa Margret*  from Mt Selinda became a part of the program!
09/02/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 445 3185: That's my employer, a Chines Company. Have not been employed since I left work in January last year 2023. So for sure things are were hard and even as of now but there is a green light going forward especially outside Zimbabwe.Thanks
09/02/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Mr Sithole.
09/02/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Mr Sithole, meanwhile considering the deadlines for the inital payments!

Are you referring to the challenges for $200 or $350 please?
09/02/24, 3:51 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Am working on this initial payment right now.
09/02/24, 3:52 pm - +263 77 445 3185: 200
09/02/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: I understand, please!
09/02/24, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: So, will you be able to meet the deadline for $200 by 17-18th February?
09/02/24, 3:54 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Let's say 18 Feb
09/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
09/02/24, 3:54 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Okey
09/02/24, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: I do appreciate your support for Untiy!

So for the further stage, there will be an interview with the Program Director, and for the same, the available slots for tomorrow are of 12 PM CAT and 12:30 PM CAT.

Which slot shall I reserve for you and Unity, please?
09/02/24, 3:59 pm - +263 77 445 3185: 12.30pm
09/02/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: The interview for tomorrow is scheduled at 12:30 PM CAT!
09/02/24, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything?
09/02/24, 4:03 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Noted. While I do not believe in failures say if I fail to raise 200 by 18 Felling what will it mean to us?

09/02/24, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: Thank you, Mr Sithole.
09/02/24, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: So as we close the day, let's reflect on this powerful quote from Proverbs 3:13-14:

*"Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold."*
09/02/24, 6:36 pm - +263 77 445 3185: Amen
