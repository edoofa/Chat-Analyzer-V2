09/02/24, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
09/02/24, 5:14 pm - +263 78 352 8105: Yes, that's right!
09/02/24, 5:17 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Gladys, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Queen Elizabeth charged you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

09/02/24, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Gladys!

So since you completed A level in 2022, what have you been doing post that?
09/02/24, 5:51 pm - +263 78 352 8105: I have been working for OK limited as a till operator from Jan 2023 till now....that's like a year in the industry now
09/02/24, 5:57 pm - +263 78 352 8105: *OK Zimbabwe limited*
09/02/24, 6:03 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, however may I know why you didn't continue with your education instead, Gladys?
09/02/24, 6:14 pm - +263 78 352 8105: Wanted to go for the Aug intake last year at Manicaland state University, MSU buh they offered me a program I didn't like, (bachelor of honours in public governance).So l opted for the next intake for me to get the program of my choice.Then in the process, I got to know about the Edoofa program and got interest hence thats why I'm here to grab a chance and fly abroad to enhance my studies outside country
09/02/24, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Oh Alright please,

I do understand!
09/02/24, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: Well Gladys now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
09/02/24, 6:30 pm - +263 78 352 8105: Yes
09/02/24, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
09/02/24, 6:40 pm - +263 78 352 8105: In order for a life change one has to leave all fears aside and face reality for a change....so with this l can say I'm  ready
09/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: Gladys, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your parents are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
09/02/24, 6:43 pm - +263 78 352 8105: Everything for their child to attain the best in life, they are in for it
09/02/24, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate their support!
09/02/24, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: Shat motivates you to study Social Work and Law?
09/02/24, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: Which out of the two are you more inclined towards?
09/02/24, 6:50 pm - +263 78 352 8105: Mostly when one studies humanities at Advanced level, it is known that law is at the top of the heirachy of programs....so everyone does have a desire to be a lawyer buh at times you might not have passion and you more into socialising the most hence one picks social work as you get to interact with others alongside doing some charity work
09/02/24, 6:52 pm - +263 78 352 8105: As for me social work is my first preference before law
09/02/24, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: I do understand !
09/02/24, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Gladys!

I would like to understand as to why you believe Social work should be your first preference?
09/02/24, 6:59 pm - +263 78 352 8105: Okay!Law requires reading in ones lifetime.Its more like dedication to reading throughout yet others we not passionate to it.So at least Social work kinda relieves from it and like I said one does something with passion and a calling
09/02/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Gladys!
09/02/24, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
09/02/24, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
09/02/24, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
09/02/24, 7:08 pm - +263 78 352 8105: Noted with thanks
09/02/24, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: Did you have a thorough reading please?
09/02/24, 7:11 pm - +263 78 352 8105: yess
09/02/24, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: So now shall I brief you about Bachelors in Sociology?
09/02/24, 7:14 pm - +263 78 352 8105: Yaa, sure
09/02/24, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society.

Here in India you would pursue Sociology itself if you wish to pursue a career in social work.
