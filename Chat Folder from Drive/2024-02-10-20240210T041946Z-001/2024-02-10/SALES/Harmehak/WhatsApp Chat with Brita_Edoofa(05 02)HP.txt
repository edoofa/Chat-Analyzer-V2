05/02/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay  understood
05/02/24, 11:09 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Brita, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Chiwara high school charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
05/02/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting your response, Brita!
05/02/24, 2:46 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay Okay, I'm a girl aged 19 turning 20 this year I've studied at Chiwara High school and finished my O level there paying $60 as for my school fees every term. I wish to be studying  biotechnology at Edoofa and this has always been my dream to get a chance to study biotechnology at Edoofa. I find my strength and passion in learning more about living organisms and medicine. As for my weakness is self-criticism. My favorite hobbies are reading and debating 


My family is a family that put education first above all and teaches respect and love between one another, my dad is a construction worker and my mother is a nurse they both finished their highschool and are both  graduates,  my older brother also finished his O level and advanced to A level and is now working as a self employed worker
05/02/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Brita, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
05/02/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind the delayed response please?
05/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Thank you
05/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Where I was the network was totally bad so I had to find a better place with good network connection to have better communication
05/02/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please!
05/02/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: Well Brita now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
05/02/24, 3:21 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay thank you
05/02/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome!
05/02/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Indeed it is a life changing decision for me and it has always been my dream to study abroad
05/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Thats good, Brita!

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
05/02/24, 3:28 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I'm  more than ready and prepared for a life abroad and ready to adapt to the new environment as well
05/02/24, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Britta, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
05/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes it is really important and I can  assure you that they are fully aware of my plans to study abroad and they are more than willing to support my higher education abroad mentally and physically
05/02/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Thats great, are they willing support financially too?
05/02/24, 3:36 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes they are
05/02/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
05/02/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Could you please share your O level results with me?
05/02/24, 3:40 pm - +263 78 530 9052: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:40 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay
05/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
05/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study Biotechnology, Britta?

I believe you must be aware that you would be pursuing Diploma itself?
05/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 78 530 9052: I've always had a passion for studying more about life science and Biotechnology is amongst the most recession-proof professions in the current times. 

So, it offers job security. The field of study teaches knowledge and skills that enable one to handle unexpected situations and come up with solutions for societal improvement and it also provides the opportunity to learn about the biological sciences, study the basic and advanced techniques of research, learn to apply experimental methods and analytical procedures, and understand the applications and uses of biotechnology itself
05/02/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I'm fully aware that I will be pursuing Diploma
05/02/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know of your thoughts, Brita!
05/02/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, however why didn't you pursue A level please?
05/02/24, 4:39 pm - +263 78 530 9052: I never really pictured myself going to A level as I've always wanted to get a diploma first then a degree
05/02/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: I can understand Brita!
05/02/24, 4:40 pm - Harmehak: What all did you research regarding your desired course, Brita?
05/02/24, 4:50 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay I've also researched  that Biotechnology is an interdisciplinary subject that covers topics such as biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, molecular biology, chemical engineering and robotics too and that 
Most of the classes I  will take in biotechnology  may involve laboratory work, along with analyzing biological research
05/02/24, 4:52 pm - +263 78 530 9052: And that it needs a lot of hard working and determination
05/02/24, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you did research, Brita!
05/02/24, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: Brita, as you know you would as of now have to pursue a Diploma first and then you could venture into Bachelor,

I personally believe that pursuing a *Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology* would be the right opportunity for you. SInce with this, you are laying a solid foundation for your future in the realm of life sciences. This program equips you with essential skills and knowledge in laboratory techniques, a crucial aspect of the broader field of biotechnology. Even though you haven't pursued Advanced Level education, this diploma serves as an excellent stepping stone toward your passion for biotechnology.

Upon completion of your Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology, you'll not only have a strong understanding of laboratory practices but also the practical experience necessary for the intricate work involved in biotechnology. Many aspects of laboratory technology are directly applicable to biotechnological research and development.

Consider your diploma as the initial phase of your journey. Subsequently, when you pursue your Bachelor's, you can specialize in Biotechnology, building upon the foundational knowledge gained during your diploma. This pathway will not only allow you to enter the biotechnology field but also position you advantageously with practical insights gained from your hands-on experience in laboratory technology. It's a strategic route that aligns with your passion and offers a promising trajectory toward advancements in the exciting and recession-proof field of Biotechnology.
05/02/24, 5:47 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes yes very true
05/02/24, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so let me brief you about Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology.
05/02/24, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: *Diploma in Medical Lab Technology*

05/02/24, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Brita, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/02/24, 6:26 pm - +263 78 530 9052: I would like to study abroad and not in my country because  according to my researching I've seen that India have  the best obtained grades in studying biotechnology than here in my country and I would love to acquire deep understanding to inter culture

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
05/02/24, 6:40 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Brita_Edoofa(01/02)HP" to "Brita_Edoofa(05/02)HP"
05/02/24, 6:52 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Well according to some of my researching  Indian schools prioritize character building and values education, instilling qualities such as discipline, respect, integrity, and empathy in students. These values shape their moral compass and equip them with essential life skills.
The cost of tuition fees, accommodation, and other expenses is much lower in Indian universities than in foreign universities. This makes it a popular choice for students who want to pursue higher education but are on a tight budget. It is also one of the most strongest educational systems in the world with prominent people like the owner of Google coming being Indian and even the prime minister of Britain being Indian and not forgetting the owner of Microsoft who are all Indian meaning to say they have had the best education in India. It also have the best medical schools and most pharmaceutical shops in Zimbabwe, Zambia or Zimbabwe are owned by Indians and this all inspires me to study in India as it will surely help me to achieve my dreams
05/02/24, 6:56 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know of your knowledge and thorough research, Brita!
05/02/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

05/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
05/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians!
05/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 7:57 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay
06/02/24, 9:33 am - +263 78 530 9052: Good morning Ms Harmehak
06/02/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
06/02/24, 9:34 am - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I'm doing well, we can start
06/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: So were you able to go through the shared video?
06/02/24, 9:37 am - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I was and it's quite interesting
06/02/24, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Thats great!
06/02/24, 9:38 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
06/02/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I've looked into some higher education for international students without any scholarship in India and discovered that there would be much more expenses than one with a scholarship like in Parul University or Dheli University and I find Edoofa being much more favorable in terms of scholarships
06/02/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: While I understand what you are sharing, did you happen to research about Parul University?
06/02/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I have but not much
06/02/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: It is quite unfortunate to hear about that, since Edoofa is associated with some of the finest and the most resourceful universities in India, we are partnered up with more than 250+ Universities in India but we are not associated with Parul University because of a reason.
06/02/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: The reason being Parul University isn't ranked under NIRF and the degrees offered by them are not recognized on a global level, it is because the founders are accused of rape. 

When we know all this about the university and the management working there, there is no way we can ever think of partnering with such universities and sending our students over there. 

For your reference, I am sharing the link to the news with you so that you can check the same for yourself.

06/02/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Infact in many places in India the degree won't' be valid as well!
06/02/24, 9:58 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay I understand
06/02/24, 9:59 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay
06/02/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
06/02/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/02/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/02/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/02/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay I can see that the Edoofa program makes it easier fr students and also makes education   affordable through employability
06/02/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
06/02/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
06/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 530 9052: I think the opportunity given for  students to reduce their remaining annual fees as as much as they can through earn while you learn program is really helpful  because it also offers students to get a chance to purchase some personal necessities of their own
06/02/24, 10:28 am - +263 78 530 9052: And also helps parents to pay less making it much more affordable
06/02/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: I am glad you are thorough following the entire discussion and you do understand!
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

06/02/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay I understand and can see that most students develop helpful skills through the EWYL Program becoming more and more creative  and it also collaborates in helping to reduce fees on parents I'm also glad that it sets up students for the 21st-century job opportunities so that one is already set up to get into the field and work without any problem of wanting to adjust to what is happening. It also seems to provide personal growth making one much more confident in doing a job or task
06/02/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate your understanding Brita and that's surely very correct!
06/02/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/02/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 530 9052: I'm equally impressed that I can do EWYL program and it will be a good feeling to know that I have contributed something for my education and I'm fully prepared to work as hard as I can to earn more  to help pay of the scholarship and help my parents pay less
06/02/24, 11:25 am - Harmehak: I admire your dedication and commitment, Brita!
06/02/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/02/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 530 9052: Oooh I didn't realize that you are in your own league and so far I've not heard if there are any other organizations that can match you because already I feel like I can do the best that I can for my own education and would also want to be able to pay my whole fees through the EWYL program through Edoofa so I really do wish I get the opportunity to be part of this amazing program
06/02/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: I am delighted to know of your dedicated thoughts to do well along with the same I appreciate your kind words!
06/02/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
06/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I'm ready
06/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Brita as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
06/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 78 530 9052: It could  cost the student about $1500-$2250
06/02/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/02/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
06/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay I understand, making it much more affordable
06/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
06/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/02/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes I agree, Edoofa is making a great impact in helping admission process for international students and seems to be one of the best
06/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/02/24, 12:09 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay I understand, this is great
06/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
06/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes yes I understand
06/02/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/02/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
06/02/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

06/02/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay I understand
06/02/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/02/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

06/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay thank you
06/02/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries for me Brita?
06/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Wow they are indeed very excited
06/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 78 530 9052: I've talked to her and she explained a few important facts
06/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Not at all
06/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
06/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
06/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

06/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.

06/02/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay thank you
06/02/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: I would like to share an exciting news as well that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*
06/02/24, 1:05 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Ooh wonderful, I'd love to be part of the mega seminar
06/02/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: We do look forward to the same, Brita!
07/02/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
07/02/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 530 9052: Good morning, yes we can proceed with the application now
07/02/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: So how was your discussion with your parents, Talent?

What all did you discuss with them?
07/02/24, 11:59 am - +263 78 530 9052: Firstly  We discussed about the Edoofa program and it's vision of making Education Affordable and Employment ready, we all came to an agreement to say that Edoofa is one of the best programs and that they are willing to help in what ever way they can mentally and financially, they also support the idea of my desired course in india since it is well known for its good educational systems. They also loved the fact that Edoofa will be helping to arrange the fees needed and were really surprised by the EWYL program too, they said it is worth trusting and had no problem with the whole program
07/02/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that you all had a thorough discussion and that they are supportive for your application to study in India!
07/02/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
07/02/24, 12:05 pm - +263 78 530 9052: They haven't connected with her yet but during the discussion we mentioned her testament and they watched the video of her daughters and my parents were really inspired
07/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, however do request them to connect as well, Brita!
07/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay okay
07/02/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to connect?
07/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes yes
07/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Thats great!
07/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
07/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 530 9052: My dad has connected with Ms Ruth already and he is really impressed with Edoofa
07/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Okay I've seen the video and it's really awesome
07/02/24, 12:27 pm - +263 78 530 9052: [07/02, 12:14] Zano: Am about to send my daughter to India through Edoofa so l just wanted to get from you how your journey has been with them
[07/02, 12:15] ruth magwaza: Just follow their instructions
[07/02, 12:15] ruth magwaza: We don't have any problems with the program
[07/02, 12:15] ruth magwaza: It's a program that gives you 50 percent scholarship and above

[07/02, 12:19] Zano: Ohoh, that's quite impressive. I thank you for giving such an uplifting insight about Edoofa , l am really content with your input and l can already see my daughter going far in her endeavours
07/02/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know, Brita!
07/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Brita!
07/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Brita, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
07/02/24, 1:08 pm - +263 78 530 9052: 1. Biotechnology course                              2.  India                                                                   3. Without a scholarship it'll probably cost around $8000                                            4. The annual fee I will pay if I am found eligible for the program would range from $2500 -$3000                                          5. The enrolment fee is $350                         6. I would have to pay the first part of the enrolment fee within 7 days and then the remaining balance within the next 30  days                                                        7.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

Topic:  Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient 


Apparently it is true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient because 
the climate in Africa is such that both periodic droughts and floods are experienced in alternate fashion. These two phenomena usually result in severe food shortages due to poor harvests. 
Supply chain costs and related issues are a major obstacle to the renaissance of African agriculture.
Making food supply chains more efficient and profitable requires reliable and efficient delivery of upstream goods and services, as well as downstream delivery of the goods to market. 
There are several factors behind these substandard harvests.Many African farmers lack the basic things many farmers outside the region take for granted, like access to improved crop varieties, fertilizers, and irrigation. Although some progress has been made, addressing these weaknesses by themselves is not enough. The productivity of Africa's agriculture is low as the continent's crop yields have lagged behind the rest of the world. 
More than half of the labour force work in agriculture, and the labour productivity very low. Recurring drought, conflict, and instability have led to severe food shortages. Many countries have struggled with extreme poverty for decades, so there is a lack of government and community support systems for families.
Poor infrastructure and limited resources compounded with conflict, HIV, and poor access to health services are factors that contribute to the staggering levels of malnutrition and food insecurity on the continent.
Other factors, such as year on year droughts in the horn of Africa, locust storms destroying crops, internal conflict in Ethiopia, and floods and droughts across the Sahel were already having a devastating impact on people's lives, families, health, and livelihoods.A deadly mix of drought, conflict and COVID-19 has pushed more than 10 million people across Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda to the brink of starvation. In addition ,Low-fertility soils, environmental degradation, limited access to relevant technologies and poor infrastructure continued to impede progress in developing the agricultural sector. Agriculture  stagnation can also be defined as a situation of low growth, low production and productivity in the agriculture sector.Such a situation is characterised by such factors as cultivation mainly for self-consumption, lack of proper means of irrigation, negligible use of modern technology, etc. In most recent years, farm production expenses are projected to increase while farm income will decrease. This dynamic will put some farmers in a tight spot trying to make ends meet while also servicing their existing debt. With these trends, it's no wonder that many growers face difficulty accessing . Resource depletion is one of the primary concerns modern farmers need to consider.The global population is growing, meaning the demand for food and other agricultural products is increasing, which puts a strain on the finite resources available to them.

Personality test 

My inspirational story 

Well growing up I've always had the passion to care and learn new things on a daily basis. I am a person who will never stop until I've reached my goal . Being raised up in a family that always puts education respect and love made me to be the person I am today. I would always and am still getting support from my parents and they truly inspire me to get all the education I need. 

They also play a huge role in teaching me how to work hard to achieve certain things in life. I've learnt that many goals are achieved through working hard and all thanks to my family for raising me in this way. This also encourages me to be able to stand out for myself in any situation and not to depend on my family to do everything for me . 

As time goes I would be glad to be able to inspire people of my own and show them that education is really important and for them to do programmes that will help them in life. In life we certainly do get some obstacles and we do face challenges even during our education but giving up is never the solution. I've also learned to be patient at things that I do and even if it's hard ,I should not give up. As students we also suffer from a lot of peer pressure but it should not be a reason for giving up of letting go of our dreams in such a situation I would encourage my fellow brothers and sisters to increase their focus and should not be easily distracted . 

I've always seen myself reaching my goals in life but only through hard work and determination and as for this 
I will always work hard to finish my education. As most people say that patience pays off and if having to wait for time to start my journey to higher education then it'll be worth waiting for. 

Having to get an opportunity to achieve my goal is something worth working hard for and would be ready to do as much as I can to succeed.
07/02/24, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Let me get it evaluated!
07/02/24, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: Brita, While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
07/02/24, 6:43 pm - +263 78 530 9052: Yes yes
07/02/24, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: Sure Brita!

Dear parents, I believe you must have followed the entire discussion so far!

So, now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Brita's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
07/02/24, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: Kindly check with your parents, Brita!
07/02/24, 8:28 pm - +27 74 935 5626: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
07/02/24, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
07/02/24, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
07/02/24, 8:36 pm - +27 74 935 5626: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
07/02/24, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
07/02/24, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
07/02/24, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th or 15th February 2024 for $200 and the 14th or 15th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th or 15th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
07/02/24, 8:57 pm - +27 74 935 5626: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand Mr Zano, *as you know in the event if Brita is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline.*

You can definitely communicate regarding your challenge with the Program Director and request for an extension for the remaining amount.
07/02/24, 9:03 pm - Harmehak: So the available slot for the interview with the Program Director for tomorrow is of 12:30 PM CAT.

Shall I reserve for you and Brita, please?
07/02/24, 9:06 pm - +27 74 935 5626: Yes please do and thank you very much
07/02/24, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: Your interview has been scheduled for *12:30 PM CAT time, tomorrow.* Please set an alarm to ensure you're available at least 10 minutes before the call. Also, make the necessary preparations for a video call. Please note that the director will only conduct the interview once, and missing it may lead to application cancellation. Best of luck!
Additionally, we'll be sharing a letter from our Honorable Director, Mr. Abhinav Gupta, with parents before the interview. Please make sure to go through the document, and as parents, acknowledge it using a voice note.
07/02/24, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!

*Please confirm these details with me!*
09/02/24, 9:09 am - +263 78 530 9052: All correct
09/02/24, 9:10 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
09/02/24, 9:10 am - Harmehak: Mr Gobvu, I did discuss about Brita's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7-day deadline period. 

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Brita's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
09/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same, Mr Gobvu?
