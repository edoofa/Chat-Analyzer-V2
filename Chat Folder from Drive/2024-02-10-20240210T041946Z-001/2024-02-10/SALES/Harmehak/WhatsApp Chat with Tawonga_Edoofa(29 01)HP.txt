30/01/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!

30/01/24, 12:16 pm - +260 97 2368032: Yes that’s exactly what it is
30/01/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Tawonga, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD St Francis Secondary charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
30/01/24, 10:15 pm - +260 97 2368032: Sure🙏🏾
31/01/24, 9:37 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
31/01/24, 9:39 am - +260 97 2368032: Good morning, i am all good how are you
31/01/24, 9:48 am - Harmehak: I am expecting your response please!
31/01/24, 9:49 am - +260 97 2368032: I think it will be depending on the scholarship percentage I’ll be given
31/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Alright!
31/01/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
31/01/24, 9:53 am - +260 97 2368032: I understand now
31/01/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
31/01/24, 10:05 am - +260 97 2368032: No queries
31/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Tawonga, considering the financial aspect and support!

Is your family willing to support you with roughly $1200-1400 a year?
31/01/24, 10:30 am - +260 97 2368032: Yes
31/01/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Kindly request your mother to acknowledge the same using a voice note!
31/01/24, 10:39 am - +260 97 2368032: Sure
31/01/24, 10:41 am - +260 97 7870366: This message was deleted
31/01/24, 10:41 am - +260 97 7870366: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement, Mrs Mary.
31/01/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: So now, kindly share your Academic results, Tawonga.
31/01/24, 10:46 am - +260 97 7870366: You are welcome
31/01/24, 10:47 am - +260 97 2368032: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Received please,

So what motivates you to study Human Resource Management, Tawonga?
31/01/24, 10:51 am - +260 97 2368032: I feel I am able to work and relate well with people and i posses good leadership skills which may be efficient for the society at large
31/01/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Thats great, Tawonga!

Meanwhile are you aware that Human Resource Management studies are a part of Business Administration itsef?
31/01/24, 12:14 pm - +260 97 2368032: Yes  I am aware that it is under business administration
31/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

How do you believe studying in India would assist you build a promising future?
01/02/24, 10:57 am - +260 97 2368032: On the resources shared I think India is a talent  factory indeed!! 


I feel india will have more opportunities for to showcase what I can offer and more opportunities to continue pursuing my career, the resources you shared have shown many wealthy people recommending to study in India so I think this would assist me in building a very promising future
01/02/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Tawonga!

We look forward to you fulfilling your vision.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
01/02/24, 11:23 am - +260 97 2368032: I have no idea about how much the fees are without a scholarship
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
02/02/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
02/02/24, 9:58 am - +260 97 2368032: Good morning
02/02/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Tawonga?
02/02/24, 10:09 am - +260 97 2368032: Yes I have, i have understood the cost of quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship <This message was edited>
02/02/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: In simple words Tawonga, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
02/02/24, 10:40 am - +260 97 2368032: I see
02/02/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the costs after higher quantum, Tawonga?
02/02/24, 3:07 pm - +260 97 2368032: I guess the fee’s after higher quantum are reasonable and Affordable as compared to other countries
02/02/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Yes please.
02/02/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to discuss with your mother too?
02/02/24, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Kindly ensure active participation tomorrow!*
03/02/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
03/02/24, 10:09 am - Harmehak: I would like to share an exciting news that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*
03/02/24, 12:07 pm - +260 97 2368032: Yes
03/02/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
03/02/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: I am expecting your response!

May I know why aren't you participating actively?
03/02/24, 12:28 pm - +260 97 2368032: I haven’t discussed this with my mother yet! 

I have a problem with my network provider here, so it a bit hard to actively participate sometimes
03/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: While I understand, I believe she is following the discussion, isn't it?
03/02/24, 12:30 pm - +260 97 2368032: Yes she is
03/02/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: So did she happen to share any queries so far?
03/02/24, 12:36 pm - +260 97 2368032: No
03/02/24, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Alright
03/02/24, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: So is she willing to support you financially, Tawonga?
03/02/24, 12:38 pm - +260 97 2368032: Yes she is
03/02/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted!
03/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
03/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
03/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

03/02/24, 12:43 pm - +260 97 2368032: The EWYL program looks like a good program
03/02/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
03/02/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/02/24, 12:48 pm - +260 97 2368032: I see, which makes everything else simpler
03/02/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
03/02/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/02/24, 12:53 pm - +260 97 2368032: Yes I have seen the difference 👏🏽
03/02/24, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
03/02/24, 1:00 pm - +260 97 2368032: Yes
03/02/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: Tawonga, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
03/02/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
03/02/24, 1:06 pm - +260 97 2368032: That would cost around  $2250 if one applies to five universities
03/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
03/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 1:09 pm - +260 97 2368032: I see
03/02/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
03/02/24, 1:10 pm - +260 97 2368032: Yes indeed
03/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
03/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/02/24, 1:13 pm - +260 97 2368032: I see
03/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
03/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
03/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/02/24, 1:17 pm - +260 97 2368032: Yes
03/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
03/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
03/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

03/02/24, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: Penmal Connect.vcf (file attached)
03/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Do connect with Ms Betty at Penmal Connect as well!
03/02/24, 4:16 pm - +260 97 2368032: Today
03/02/24, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: Sure, Tawonga!
03/02/24, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
03/02/24, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
03/02/24, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

03/02/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
03/02/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.
03/02/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: Also have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.
