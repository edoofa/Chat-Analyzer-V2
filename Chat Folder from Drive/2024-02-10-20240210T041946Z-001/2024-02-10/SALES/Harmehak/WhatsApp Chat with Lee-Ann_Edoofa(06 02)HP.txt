06/02/24, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Lee-Ann 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
06/02/24, 6:32 pm - +263 77 398 3934: No I'm not quite sure about it
06/02/24, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
06/02/24, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 7:17 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Oh okay I understand that's very reasonable indeed
06/02/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Lee-Ann, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/02/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
06/02/24, 7:45 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Wow that's amazing I'd be more than delighted.
That's will be great
06/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
06/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

06/02/24, 7:49 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Ohh okay okay I understand.
Do credits of the EWYL affect the scholarship program.
For instance if I do not get enough credits does it affect anything
06/02/24, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: No please!
06/02/24, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Ohh now I understand 
Thats a really good thing it helps students lessen the burden of expenses
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate and I am glad you now have a better clarity.
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Thank you for pointing it our
06/02/24, 7:57 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Out
06/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/02/24, 8:01 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Wow😃
06/02/24, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
06/02/24, 8:02 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Yes im ready <This message was edited>
06/02/24, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: Lee-Ann as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
06/02/24, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/02/24, 8:06 pm - +263 77 398 3934: About  $1500-$2250
06/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
06/02/24, 8:10 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Ohh okay okay
06/02/24, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/02/24, 8:14 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Yes that is very unique compared to most programs
06/02/24, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/02/24, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/02/24, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/02/24, 8:24 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Okay noted..
06/02/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/02/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
06/02/24, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/02/24, 8:27 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Yes I understand
06/02/24, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/02/24, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
06/02/24, 8:27 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

06/02/24, 8:31 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Oh okay okay i get it
06/02/24, 8:31 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/02/24, 8:31 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
06/02/24, 8:31 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 8:32 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Okay let me do so
06/02/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
06/02/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: Do request your parents to connect as well, Lee-Ann.
06/02/24, 8:36 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Alright I'll let them know
06/02/24, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
06/02/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
06/02/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/02/24, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

07/02/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 398 3934: Good morning
07/02/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
07/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 398 3934: Morning 
Yes we have and I'm sure we can proceed..
07/02/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: So how was your discussion with your parents, Lee-Ann?

What all did you discuss with them?
07/02/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 398 3934: We spoke about the whole system of Edoofa how it functions. The advantages of choosing Edoofa as compared to other scholarship programs. The EWYL and how it benefits me and my financial needs.
The application process and the application fees after getting accepted and the guarantee of me getting accepted to universities.
07/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 77 398 3934: And also how Edoofa helps me in every step I take...from career guidance to being collected to the airport
07/02/24, 11:52 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that you all had a thorough discussion, Lee-Ann!
07/02/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Thats wonderful!
07/02/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: What all would you or your parents like to ask, Lee-Ann?
07/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 398 3934: Mhh for now I think we are okay....
07/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 737 4236: Everything is clear
07/02/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Lee-Ann and Mrs Michelle!
07/02/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
07/02/24, 12:06 pm - +263 77 398 3934: My mother said she will once she gets the opportunity 

Wow that's truly remarkable indeed
07/02/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I do understand and appreciate!

Were you able to connect, Lee-Ann?
07/02/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Yes I did send a message but she hasn't responded
07/02/24, 12:20 pm - +263 77 737 4236: Not yet we have not managed to contact her
07/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 737 4236: She has not responded to messages
07/02/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: I believe She will get back to you once online!

You can call her directly as well.
07/02/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Okay Ms Harmehak we'll do so...
07/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

07/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Wow okay it's currently downloading now
07/02/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
07/02/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Lee-Ann, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
07/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 398 3934: 1. Law

2. India

3. $6000-$8000 

4. $2000-$3000

5. The enrollment fee of the edoofa program is $350

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

Addressing the Link between Poor Diets in Africa and Stagnant Farming Practices

The topic of African diets and the role of stagnant and inefficient farming practices in contributing to poor nutrition is an important and complex issue. While it is true that some areas of Africa face challenges in agricultural productivity, it is essential to approach this topic with a nuanced perspective. This essay aims to explore the factors influencing diets in Africa and the interplay between farming practices and food security to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

To begin with, Africa is a diverse continent with a multitude of cultures, traditions, and agricultural practices. It is crucial to acknowledge that there is substantial variation in diets across different regions. Africa's wide range of climates and ecosystems enables the production of diverse crops, including grains, fruits, vegetables, and livestock.
Undoubtedly, certain areas in Africa do face challenges in agricultural productivity. These challenges stem from a combination of factors, such as limited access to adequate resources, including arable land, quality seeds, modern farming techniques, credit, and markets. Additionally, climate change, environmental degradation, and political instability exacerbate these difficulties.

In some instances, the use of traditional and less efficient farming methods persists due to a lack of awareness, education, and access to modern agricultural technologies. Limited financial capital and inadequate infrastructure further hinder the adoption of more efficient practices. These factors can result in stagnant productivity and lower yields, impacting the availability and affordability of nutritious food.

While stagnant farming practices can contribute to poor diets in certain areas, it is important to recognize that diet quality is influenced by a range of factors beyond agricultural productivity. Socioeconomic conditions, access to markets, dietary preferences, cultural norms, and food distribution systems also shape food consumption patterns. Moreover, income inequality and poverty play a significant role in determining dietary choices and access to a variety of nutritious foods.

Therefore numerous initiatives are addressing the challenges faced by African farmers. Governments, non-governmental organizations, and international donors are investing in research, education, infrastructure development, and technology transfer to enhance agricultural productivity. These efforts aim to improve farming techniques, increase yields, and strengthen market linkages.

An essential aspect of improving African diets is promoting sustainable and climate-smart farming practices. Encouraging resource-efficient techniques, such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and precision farming, can enhance productivity while preserving natural resources. Furthermore, empowering smallholder farmers, particularly women, through training, access to credit, and market opportunities, can significantly impact farming outcomes and dietary diversity.

Furthermore to enhance nutritional outcomes, efforts must focus on promoting the consumption of diverse and nutrient-rich foods. These could include indigenous crops, vegetables, legumes, and animal-source foods. Nutrition education programs should raise awareness about the importance of balanced diets and support local communities in cultivating and consuming a wider variety of foods.

While stagnant and inefficient farming practices in some African regions can contribute to poor diets, it is crucial to avoid oversimplification. A range of factors, including socioeconomic dynamics, cultural practices, and access to markets, also influence nutrition outcomes. It is imperative to support sustainable and climate-smart farming practices, enhance agricultural productivity, and promote dietary diversity to improve overall nutrition in Africa. Collaborative efforts involving governments, farmers, researchers, and international partners can pave the way for a future where African diets are more nutritiously balanced and sustainable.

Section 6

My inspirational story begins with my own reflective past that was faced with numerous challenges and obstacles throughout my life. Growing up in a small town, i was surrounded by limited opportunities and a lack of resources, but i never let these circumstances define me. Instead, I used them as motivation to strive for something better.

From a young age, I learned the importance of hard work and determination. My parents, who worked tirelessly to make ends meet, instilled in me the value of perseverance and the belief that anything was possible with the right mindset. Despite the financial hardships we faced, they always encouraged me to dream big and pursue my passions.

One of my early experiences that shaped my perspective on life was when my family faced a major financial setback. We lost our home during a fire and had to rely on the support of relatives until we could get back on our feet. It was a difficult time, but it taught me the importance of resilience and adaptability. I realized that setbacks were just temporary roadblocks, not permanent barriers to success.

Education became my refuge during these challenging times. I immersed myself in books, soaking up knowledge and expanding my horizons. I discovered that learning was not only a means to escape my circumstances but also a powerful tool for personal growth. Education became my passport to a better future.

As I progressed through my academic journey, I encountered new obstacles and faced moments of self-doubt. There were times when I questioned my abilities and felt overwhelmed by the pressure to succeed. However, I refused to let these moments define me. Instead, I sought support from my friends, teachers, and mentors who believed in me when I couldn't believe in myself. Their encouragement and guidance became the fuel that propelled me forward.

I learned the value of perseverance and resilience through my involvement in extracurricular activities. Whether it was participating in sports or joining clubs, these experiences taught me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and leadership. I discovered that pushing myself outside of my comfort zone was necessary for personal growth and development.

As I reflect on my journey, I realize that my story is not just about overcoming adversity; it is about embracing the challenges and finding strength within myself. It is about understanding that failure is not a sign of weakness but an opportunity for growth. My inspirational story is about continuously striving for excellence, even when the odds are stacked against me.

Today, I stand as a testament to resilience, determination, and the belief that anyone can achieve their dreams. My journey has molded me into a strong, compassionate, and empathetic individual. I have learned to empathize with others facing hardships and offer support whenever possible.

In conclusion, my inspirational story is a reminder that no matter where you come from or the challenges you face, it is within your power to create your own destiny. It is the intertwining of perseverance, determination, and unwavering belief in oneself that paves the way for success. Through my experiences, I have developed a growth mindset, where failures are seen as opportunities for growth and success is not simply reaching a goal but embracing a way of life. My story is not about reaching a destination; it is about the transformative journey towards becoming the best version of myself.

07/02/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: Let me get it evaluated please!

07/02/24, 6:12 pm - Harmehak: Lee-Ann, While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
07/02/24, 6:14 pm - +263 77 398 3934: Alright ma'am
07/02/24, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Sure Lee-Ann!

Mrs Michelle, I believe you must have followed the entire discussion so far!

So, now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Lee-Ann's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
07/02/24, 6:23 pm - +263 77 737 4236: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 6:24 pm - +263 77 737 4236: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
07/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
07/02/24, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
07/02/24, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
07/02/24, 7:58 pm - +263 77 737 4236: Yes am more than willing to support her to the fullest
07/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
07/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
07/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
07/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th or 15th February 2024 for $200 and the 14th or 15th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th or 15th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
07/02/24, 8:49 pm - +263 77 737 4236: 1
07/02/24, 8:50 pm - +263 77 737 4236: I think that the first option is more flexible for me
07/02/24, 8:50 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
07/02/24, 8:52 pm - Harmehak: I do appreciate your support for Lee-Ann!
