08/02/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.

08/02/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Munashe, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your parents are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
08/02/24, 1:01 pm - +263 77 453 8801: Yes  both of them
08/02/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Munashe, you happened to mention financial challenges earlier,

So I would like to have a better understanding as to who would be the one supporting you financially for your Higher education in India please?
08/02/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 453 8801: Umm my parents ,. They can strive for. Me
08/02/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
08/02/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Munashe, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/02/24, 1:15 pm - +263 77 453 8801: Umm yeah l wanted to be part of Edoofa scholarship program but to be honest l don't think that my parents can afford such huge amounts

08/02/24, 1:23 pm - +263 77 453 8801: Ok maybe l made a mistake is the amount in USD
