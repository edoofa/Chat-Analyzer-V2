29/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: That's great
29/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: So now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/01/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
29/01/24, 12:00 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Ok noted ,. Mufaro is my daughter and is willing to be one of the students to be enrolled with Edoofa
29/01/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful.
29/01/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Mr Gilbert, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mrs Ruth better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
29/01/24, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: I await your response
29/01/24, 1:30 pm - +263 73 456 6584: IAM Gilbert Bhunu ,48 years of age ,employed by Zesa Enterprises as an electrical Linesman for the past 24(twenty four) years  , married to Ruth Bhunu (nee Gonese for the past  twenty one years(21) 
Iam an electrical Linesman and electrician class 3
29/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Mr Gilbert, Its a pleasure to know about you and Mrs Ruth!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
29/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Mr Gilbert, I believe Mufaro is a student at First Choice Private School?
29/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 73 456 6584: True  she is at First choice Private school
29/01/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

I would like to share an exciting news that we are associated with the school and along with the same there are students who are already a part of the program from the school and are here in India as well!
29/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 73 456 6584: So it's good news if there are other former school mates there
29/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
29/01/24, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
29/01/24, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
30/01/24, 1:15 am - +263 73 456 6584: Which Arts programs are offered there because here she is doing Cambridge arts lessons
30/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
30/01/24, 9:47 am - +263 73 456 6584: Yes morning
30/01/24, 9:51 am - Harmehak: While we will discuss the same,

May I know what are fields that Mufaro is inclined towards?
30/01/24, 9:53 am - +263 73 456 6584: She is doing bible studies  English Literature and History ,hoping to do Social work program as first priority but if that fails then maybe Law
30/01/24, 9:58 am - Harmehak: Alright please!

Let me brief you about social work in that case.
30/01/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
30/01/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
30/01/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
30/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 73 456 6584: Ok
30/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Yes please.
30/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 73 456 6584: Ok so the sociology program ,is it possible for her to get that
How much will she be paying if it's 50% and if it's 100% scholarship what does she need or pay that is not catered for by the sponsors
30/01/24, 10:24 am - Harmehak: While we will discuss the finances as well,

May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship?
30/01/24, 10:42 am - +263 73 456 6584: I think from the one you send on 100% issue ,the tuition fees is paid in full and maybe the student will only be paying the food and accomodation only
30/01/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
30/01/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: While she can definitely pursue Sociology,

We will discuss the finances as we proceed ahead!
30/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 73 456 6584: Ok thank you so much
30/01/24, 11:03 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome,

So Mr Gilbert, now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
30/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 73 456 6584: Maybe  it's because the degrees ,diplomas and certificates are recognized internationally , and some of the great people and prominent business people have also obtained their education from India
30/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: That's correct!
30/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

30/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed the shared information and resources, Mr Gilbert?
30/01/24, 2:47 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Yes I did
30/01/24, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Mr Gilbert 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
30/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Yes
30/01/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Can you please share your knowledge?
30/01/24, 3:05 pm - +263 73 456 6584: I was told that it depends with the universities , and where they are located as well as their popularity  , some charge tuition fees ranging from $500-$800/ Simester and accomodation on campus was told is a bit expensive so the better to opt for off campus where it will cost around $50 and food was told is very affordable to as little as $30/ month so for accommodation and food was told if you get something around $1200 /year it will be ok
30/01/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright!
30/01/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Ok so is very cheap
30/01/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/01/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/01/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 4:43 pm - +263 78 362 1370: I think Earning while I learn is better
30/01/24, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Indeed;
30/01/24, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
30/01/24, 5:38 pm - +263 78 362 1370: I think that will be affordable and it's better because it reduces  some costs
30/01/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
30/01/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
30/01/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
30/01/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

30/01/24, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation!
30/01/24, 6:15 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay
30/01/24, 6:18 pm - +263 78 362 1370: So does that mean that after pursuing my course l could be hired as a webinar
30/01/24, 6:19 pm - +263 73 456 6584: She has come from school and will be answering some of the questions directed to her and if she has questions she is free to ask because at the end she is the one who is going to get into the situation knowingly
30/01/24, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, I understand and she is more than welcome to share her queries!
30/01/24, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: These are webinars you participate in the Earn While You Learn Program!
30/01/24, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/01/24, 6:24 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Thank you for welcoming me
30/01/24, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
30/01/24, 6:29 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay, this is much better and reasonable it saves a lot of cost and l could actually be experienced in any kind of work l would be doing right
30/01/24, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Mufaro!
30/01/24, 6:40 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay, so how do you apply for this scholarship the EWYL program
30/01/24, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: Every student gets the opportunity to be a part of the Earn While You Learn Program.
30/01/24, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

30/01/24, 6:48 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Yes I would be glad
30/01/24, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 6:51 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay so you actually earn differently
30/01/24, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
30/01/24, 6:52 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Yes you are different
30/01/24, 6:52 pm - +263 78 362 1370: And l would also be glad to be one of the Edoofians you are proud of
30/01/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
30/01/24, 6:59 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay am ready
30/01/24, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Mufaro, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
30/01/24, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/01/24, 7:18 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay
30/01/24, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: Please?
30/01/24, 7:19 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Which means one has to spend $1500-$2250
30/01/24, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
30/01/24, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
30/01/24, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 7:20 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay that is reasonable
30/01/24, 7:24 pm - Harmehak: Mufaro, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/01/24, 7:27 pm - +263 78 362 1370: I think so because Edoofa is making it affordable for the students and that they do not have to spend much in the fees admissions
30/01/24, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
30/01/24, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
30/01/24, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/01/24, 7:31 pm - +263 78 362 1370: I would be glad to know about it
30/01/24, 7:38 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay, which is actually a good strategy in the payment of the fees and it is flexible for the economy in the African countries
30/01/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
30/01/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 7:43 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay
30/01/24, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
30/01/24, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
30/01/24, 7:45 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Are the interview and test held online or offline
30/01/24, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: The test will be done in this group itself,

While there would be a video call interview with the parents and a technical interview with you later!
30/01/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
30/01/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 7:51 pm - +263 78 362 1370: I did
30/01/24, 7:52 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay
30/01/24, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
30/01/24, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
30/01/24, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

30/01/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well!
30/01/24, 7:58 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay l will do as you have said
30/01/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
30/01/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
30/01/24, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
30/01/24, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
30/01/24, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

30/01/24, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: Dear Parents and Mufaro,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “31-01-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
30/01/24, 8:17 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay, thank you for the best wishes and counseling in my career guidance
30/01/24, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
30/01/24, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
30/01/24, 8:24 pm - +263 78 362 1370: Okay, so l will have to understand the assignments and projects that's how l will be able to earn right
30/01/24, 8:56 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
31/01/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

02/02/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Have you already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.
02/02/24, 12:51 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Not yet but we will definitely
02/02/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: May I know if you are facing any challenge please?

02/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!

Kindly manage to connect with her and discuss if you do have any queries as a parent!

I believe as a parent, she would be in a great position to assist you!
02/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Ok noted
02/02/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023!

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

TOPIC: Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant 

It is not accurate to assume that all Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and insufficient. While economic challenges and environmental factors affect food security in many regions of Africa, it is important to recognize the diversity of the continent and the various factors contributing to dietary habits.

Several regions in Africa do face challenges in agriculture, such as limited access to modern farming technologies, unpredictable weather patterns, and limited infrastructure for transporting goods. These issues can significantly impact the ability of families to produce or access nutritious food.

Adding on,  poverty and conflict in some African countries can exacerbate food insecurity and limit access to a variety of foods, leading to poor dietary diversity. However, it is crucial to highlight the resourcefulness and resilience of many African communities who employ sustainable farming practices and adapt to their environments to produce diverse and nutritious foods.

Furthermore, dietary habits in Africa are influenced by cultural, social, and economic factors, not solely by agricultural productivity. For example, traditional food preferences, culinary traditions, and cultural beliefs about food play a significant role in shaping dietary patterns. It is essential to recognize and respect these factors when discussing dietary habits in Africa.

Efforts to improve dietary habits in Africa should address a range of issues, including access to agricultural resources, education on nutrition and sustainable farming practices, economic development, and support for local food systems. Additionally, promoting diverse and nutritious traditional foods, as well as addressing gender disparities in access to resources, can contribute to improving dietary diversity and quality.

In a nutshell, while some African communities do face challenges in accessing nutritious food due to agricultural limitations, it is important to consider a holistic view of the factors influencing dietary habits in Africa. By understanding and addressing the multifaceted issues related to food security and nutrition, it is possible to support the development of sustainable, diverse, and nutritious diets across the continent.

03/02/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Greetings Everyone,
I hope that you all are doing well

I would like to share an exciting news that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*
03/02/24, 12:44 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Ready
03/02/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Mr Gilbert, given the finances and the entire program details,

Are you willing to support Mufaro's higher education in India both mentally and financially?
03/02/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: I await your response, Mr Gilbert!
04/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Yes
04/02/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
04/02/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
04/02/24, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
04/02/24, 6:30 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Yes
04/02/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need. <This message was edited>
04/02/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
04/02/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
04/02/24, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/02/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024 for $200 and the 11th or 12th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
04/02/24, 9:45 pm - +263 73 456 6584: As of now IAM not yet financially stable , I depend on hand to mouth from work ,and my challenge as of now is looking to pay as urgent as I can her exam fee which has been pegged at $120 per subject 
She was given the note on Friday ,I will ask her to scan the paper and post it her as to prove you what is going on here and has been staggered up to June
04/02/24, 9:45 pm - +263 73 456 6584: As soon as I finish the payment I will let you know my position
04/02/24, 11:55 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please
05/02/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well, Mr Gilbert.
05/02/24, 10:18 am - +263 73 456 6584: M fine
05/02/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Mr Gilbert, in such a scenario may I know by when are you planning to take the application to the further stages please?
05/02/24, 10:21 am - +263 73 456 6584: After June maybe I will be a bit stable
05/02/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Do you wish to hold the application for 5 months, Mr Gilbert?
05/02/24, 11:42 am - +263 73 456 6584: Yes
05/02/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Mr Gilbert, if you believe you would require 5 months for the initial payment of $200, how are you planning Mufaro's entire higher education please?
05/02/24, 6:02 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Situation will improve
05/02/24, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Mr Gilbert!

However, may I know what exactly are your current concerns please?

As I believe other than financials, you surely need better clarity on other aspects itself.
05/02/24, 6:15 pm - +263 73 456 6584: We do supplement salary by farming and do small jobs ,IAM an electrician class 3 as well so I do part time jobs especially weekends   ,so that farming needs inputs and I have spend a lot on the inputs and IAM expecting to be stable when i start harvesting around April and may
05/02/24, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand the same, Mr Gilbert and financial challenges are common.

However would you agree that holding application for 5 months would definitely affect the planning for Higher education?
05/02/24, 6:19 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Agree
05/02/24, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so don't you believe getting some extensions would be better rather than delaying the process, Mr Gilbert?
05/02/24, 6:23 pm - +263 73 456 6584: How long ,Extension period
05/02/24, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: I will be discussing Mufaro's application with the Academic Board and will accordingly get back to you.
05/02/24, 6:40 pm - +263 73 456 6584: It's ok thank you
05/02/24, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
05/02/24, 6:45 pm - +263 73 456 6584: Sharp
09/02/24, 8:26 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, 

*“Education is the key to unlocking the world. It is the passport to freedom.” ---- Oprah Winfrey*

With all positive energy, I am here to engage in a discussion!
09/02/24, 8:48 am - +263 78 362 1370: Morning
09/02/24, 8:48 am - Harmehak: How are you doing today?
09/02/24, 8:55 am - +263 78 362 1370: Am okay and you
09/02/24, 9:08 am - Harmehak: I am doing well!
09/02/24, 9:09 am - Harmehak: Mr Gilbert, I did discuss about Mufaro's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. 

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Mufaro's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
09/02/24, 9:34 am - +263 73 456 6584: Ok noted will come back to you if I make it I will communicate ,if I fail I will as well communicate to you
09/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: By when shall I expect to hear from you?
09/02/24, 9:37 am - +263 73 456 6584: Around Wednesday
09/02/24, 9:40 am - Harmehak: I shall expect to hear from you regarding your financial preparations by then!
09/02/24, 9:40 am - +263 73 456 6584: Yes
09/02/24, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Noted please
