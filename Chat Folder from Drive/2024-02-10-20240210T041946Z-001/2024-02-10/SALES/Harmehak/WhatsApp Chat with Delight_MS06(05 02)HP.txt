*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa.*

I am here to evaluate Sibiya Delight S's application for the Edoofa Program. 

Shall we start?
05/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 412 4558: Yes
05/02/24, 10:49 am - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Piyush who is the Head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
05/02/24, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Mrs Phillipa, may I know if you are a part of the school group with Edoofa please?
05/02/24, 11:20 am - +263 77 412 4558: No am not
05/02/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Alright, in that case, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/02/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
05/02/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians!
05/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 8:19 pm - +263 77 412 4558: It's ok
05/02/24, 8:23 pm - +263 77 412 4558: Is it full sponsorship
06/02/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
06/02/24, 9:40 am - +263 77 412 4558: Yes we can
06/02/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
06/02/24, 9:43 am - +263 77 412 4558: Ok I have understood
06/02/24, 9:43 am - Harmehak: *Meanwhile I would like to add that now we have five students who will be traveling to India from Mt Selinda High School for their higher education through the Edoofa Program in the August 2024 intake and one student for the August 2025 intake.*

06/02/24, 12:59 pm - +263 77 412 4558: It's ok
06/02/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: I would like to share an exciting news that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/02/24, 9:39 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
07/02/24, 10:54 am - +263 77 412 4558: Yes we can
07/02/24, 10:57 am - Harmehak: I have been expecting your response please!
07/02/24, 10:58 am - +263 77 412 4558: He is a well behaved boy .currently  head boy of mt selinda. He is very good in maths and he is interested in engineering
07/02/24, 10:59 am - +263 77 412 4558: Doing MPC
07/02/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Thats wonderful, its a pleasure to know about him and his leadership skills, Mrs Phillipa!
07/02/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 412 4558: Thus fine
07/02/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
07/02/24, 11:01 am - +263 77 412 4558: Yes am confident
07/02/24, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Thats wonderful!
07/02/24, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Mrs Phillipa, may I know which sub field of engineering would Delight like to pursue please? <This message was edited>
07/02/24, 11:06 am - +263 77 412 4558: Not so sure if you can send sub fields and I will.ask him to choose .have never asked him what type of engineering  he wants to persue
07/02/24, 11:15 am - Harmehak: Oh Alright please!

Mrs Phillipa there are various sub fields including Electrical engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science Engineering!
07/02/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 412 4558: Let me verify with him.
07/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Mrs Phillipa!
07/02/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 412 4558: Ok
07/02/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Phillipa, meanwhile as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
07/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 412 4558: Yes I do have
07/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 412 4558: You can explain. Madam
07/02/24, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

07/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 412 4558: Ok I have read through
07/02/24, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Mrs Phillipa!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
07/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 412 4558: We are not familiar
07/02/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
07/02/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 77 412 4558: Understood
07/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
07/02/24, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/02/24, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you all, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
