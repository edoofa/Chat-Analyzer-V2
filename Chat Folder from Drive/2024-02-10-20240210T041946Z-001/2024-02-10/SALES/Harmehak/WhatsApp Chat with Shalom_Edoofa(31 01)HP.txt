02/02/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Yes Madame.  THOUGH I HAVE SOME FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS
02/02/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate regarding the same?
02/02/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 245 6229: I leave  from hand to mouth.  My average monthly income  is US$300. Shalom has a twin brother  who also needs school fees. I also look after my ailing cancer stricken  mother.Shalom's immediate sister is doing college in cosmetology.  I would appreciate immensely if Shalom gets scholarship to persue her career of interest
02/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Mr Sithole.
02/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
02/02/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Well understood.
02/02/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: As of now, would you like to ask anything?
02/02/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Do you provide  both  scholarship and sponsorship?
02/02/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa is a scholarship program that provides 50-100% scholarship on Tuition fee itself.

02/02/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 245 6229: FRS B
02/02/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Does your scholarship cater for those studying in their native countries?
02/02/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: Received please
02/02/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: The program is only for those who wish to study in India.
02/02/24, 1:31 pm - +263 77 245 6229: What is the average monthly cost for  accommodation?
02/02/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Sithole, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
02/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Waal ! I can buy this one.
02/02/24, 1:34 pm - +263 77 245 6229: I am in
02/02/24, 1:36 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Kindly do your best to enlist her. God will  reward you.
02/02/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words please!
02/02/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
02/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Who covers for air tickets? I missed this one. And on average what's the cost from Zimbabwe to India
02/02/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$490, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations
02/02/24, 2:03 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Well understood. Thanks
02/02/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: As of now, would you like to ask anything?
02/02/24, 2:17 pm - +263 77 245 6229: I am sure  i have understood.  Waiting  for your  final assessment.  Hoping for the best
02/02/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
02/02/24, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: So Mr Sithole, now let me brief you about Shalom's desired course.
02/02/24, 2:21 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Go ahead

02/02/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Very interesting
02/02/24, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Mr Sithole.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 3:11 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Not to our knowledge
02/02/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
02/02/24, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Noted
02/02/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 3:25 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Understood
02/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Sithole, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
02/02/24, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: I believe you must recall the same?
02/02/24, 3:29 pm - +263 77 245 6229: I recall
02/02/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: So what's your take on the higher quantum, finances and the affordability, Mr Sithole?
02/02/24, 3:36 pm - +263 77 245 6229: This one i can afford.  It's  exremely reasonable
02/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
02/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

02/02/24, 3:49 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Noted
02/02/24, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/02/24, 3:50 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Wonderful
02/02/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

02/02/24, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.

By when shall I expect to hear from you, Mr Sithole?

Meanwhile, I would be communicating with Shalom please. <This message was edited>
02/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: So Shalom, did you also follow my discussion so far with Mr Sithole?
02/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 77 245 6229: One hour
02/02/24, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
02/02/24, 4:07 pm - +263 71 800 3989: Yes l did
02/02/24, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

So far, would you like to ask anything, Shalom?
02/02/24, 4:15 pm - +263 71 800 3989: Not yet...most of the things l had in mind were already asked by my father
02/02/24, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
02/02/24, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: So Shalom, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/02/24, 4:17 pm - +263 71 800 3989: Yes l am
02/02/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Shalom, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
02/02/24, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/02/24, 4:20 pm - +263 71 800 3989: 1500-2250
02/02/24, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/02/24, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/02/24, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:23 pm - +263 71 800 3989: Ok l understand
02/02/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/02/24, 4:25 pm - +263 71 800 3989: I believe so
02/02/24, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/02/24, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
02/02/24, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/02/24, 4:30 pm - +263 71 800 3989: Ok l understand
02/02/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/02/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:31 pm - +263 71 800 3989: So how many points are expected from my A level examination
02/02/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
02/02/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
02/02/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/02/24, 4:34 pm - +263 71 800 3989: Yes l did
02/02/24, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
02/02/24, 4:35 pm - +263 71 800 3989: Yes l am
02/02/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
02/02/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
02/02/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 4:43 pm - +263 71 800 3989: Ok
02/02/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/02/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
02/02/24, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

02/02/24, 5:01 pm - +263 71 800 3989: Let me reach out to her
02/02/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!

Do request your parents to connect as well!
02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
02/02/24, 5:11 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “03-02-23” at 9 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.

05/02/24, 11:40 am - +263 77 245 6229: Yes
05/02/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: So far, may I know what all would you like to ask?
05/02/24, 11:42 am - +263 77 245 6229: No question
05/02/24, 11:53 am - Harmehak: In that case, Mr Alec,

Given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Shalom's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
05/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 245 6229: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
05/02/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
05/02/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
05/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Yes
05/02/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
05/02/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
05/02/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024 for $200 and the 11th or 12th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
05/02/24, 12:26 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Would opt for (1) Yes am prepared
05/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, now Shalom's application will be submitted for Interview stage!

For the same their would be a video call interview with the Program Director!
05/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Okay
05/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: The available slot for *today is of 2:30 PM CAT.*

Shall I reserve the same for you?
05/02/24, 12:44 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Network  might be  a problem  today.  I am getting into a bus
05/02/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: It would be a short video call for 10-15 minutes itself for you, while Shalom will have a technical round using voice notes!
05/02/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 245 6229: Let's  try
05/02/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
07/02/24, 10:22 am - +263 77 245 6229: Let me check
07/02/24, 10:25 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Kindly go through the acceptance letter thoroughly so that we can discuss any queries you might have please!
07/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 245 6229: Am going  through
07/02/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: Sure please!
07/02/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 245 6229: <Media omitted>

07/02/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
08/02/24, 8:40 am - Harmehak: Good morning, I hope you are doing well!

*"For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding."*

On this positive note, I am here and ready to engage in a discussion.

I believe by now you must have gone through the Letter of Acceptance properly, may I know what all would you like to ask from the Letter of Acceptance?
08/02/24, 9:24 am - +263 77 245 6229: No questions  at the moment.  Everything is clear.
08/02/24, 9:25 am - Harmehak: Alright, Mr Sithole!
08/02/24, 9:29 am - Harmehak: In that case, Mr Sithole, since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
08/02/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 245 6229: If you have any former students in Zimbabwe, kindly  forward their  contacts if applicable  so that Shalom  might interact with them
08/02/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Shall I connect you with a student who is currently in India instead?
08/02/24, 9:32 am - +263 77 245 6229: Option 2
08/02/24, 9:33 am - +263 77 245 6229: It's still okay
08/02/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: .vcf (file attached)
08/02/24, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Kindly connect with Valerie,

I have also shared the contact of Valerie's father who happens to be a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe.
08/02/24, 9:35 am - +263 77 245 6229: Thank you
08/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Sure please!
08/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
08/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
08/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: .vcf (file attached)
08/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Here is a picture, from Left Mr Angad, Sir Charles, Mr.Piiyush and Principal of Zaka High School Mr Museba.
08/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: *For your utmost clarity, here I attach Mr. Charles's Passport*
08/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 245 6229: Thank you
08/02/24, 9:37 am - Harmehak: You're welcome, Mr Sithole!
09/02/24, 8:20 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone,

09/02/24, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
09/02/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: So as we close the day, let's reflect on this powerful quote from Proverbs 3:13-14:

*"Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold."*

I wish you all a blessed evening ahead!
