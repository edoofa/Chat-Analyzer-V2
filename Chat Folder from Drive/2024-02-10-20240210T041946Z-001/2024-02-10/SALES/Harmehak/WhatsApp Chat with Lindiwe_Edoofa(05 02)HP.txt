05/02/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Thats good, Lindiwe!

05/02/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Well Lindiwe, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
05/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 095 6605: Yes it is life changing. 
You interact with different people learning different cultures,they are better job opportunities for people who learnt abroad, countries which are abroad have better economies thus when you learn abroad and come back to your country it is easy to help to improve the economy because of the acquired knowledge you would have got, you get to learn other peoples languages, their technology is ahead of ours so we need that knowledge for the betterment of our country , you get to meet different people.
05/02/24, 11:51 am - +263 78 095 6605: It is a pleasure indeed to know that there are more people l know .
05/02/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: You see, Lindiwe, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
05/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 095 6605: l understand what you are saying and right now my focuses are not earning money but furthering my studies because with my research l discovered that with good education and proper knowledge good job opportunities will follow. But first l want to focus on my education . The rush to get money does not entice me because it is short lived but with good education there are better and bigger opportunities in life .
05/02/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that you understand the importance of education.
05/02/24, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Lindiwe?
05/02/24, 12:43 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Yes l am prepared.
05/02/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Lindiwe, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your parents are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
05/02/24, 12:48 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Yes they are prepared to support me. My mother knows the importance of education hence she is a teacher who is permanently employed by the government so they will help each other financially for me to get everything that l need.
05/02/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate their thorough support, Lindiwe!
05/02/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: So what is your take on international education right after O level, Lindiwe?
05/02/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 095 6605: My perspective is that one can go for international education right after O level depending on your maturity and the ability to take charge on the goals who have set for your self in life, l know one might say that an O level student is young to survive out there but l stand to disagree because it is easy for a young person to adjust to a different environment better than an elderly person .
05/02/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate your thoughts, Lindiwe!

And we definitely agree with you, we do have students doing Diploma right after O Level in India, Currently.
05/02/24, 1:13 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Thank you.
05/02/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study your desired course, Lindiwe?
05/02/24, 1:33 pm - +263 78 095 6605: what motivates me is knowing that as an economist you help people to understand that we need to be able to getby with the scarce resources we get.Another motivation is the love for research and knowing what is happening around the world economically .Another one is knowing financial situations around myself hence helping to build better economic situations in our countries
05/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing and it's good to see you have a thorough knowledge too, Lindiwe!

Now you see for students who wish to study degrees related to Economics, Business, Marketing, Commerce, Accounting right after O Level, they pursue *Diploma in Business Administration*.
05/02/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Absolutely! Pursuing a Diploma in Business Administration in India is a powerful step toward achieving your aspirations as an economist. Just as your motivation revolves around the effective allocation of scarce resources, economic awareness, and improving financial situations, this diploma program aligns perfectly with your goals.

thank you ma’am.
05/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Having completed a diploma, you may find that you already have a strong grasp of some foundational economic concepts, which can be advantageous during your Bachelor's studies.

05/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Thank you ma’am this increases the knowledge that l have about lndian education
05/02/24, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Yes we are familiar. We always had lndia as an educational option then by honor and luck we came Edoofa offering life changing scholarships we decided to take part in the application process . Our researches had said the payment amounts ranged from USD1600-USD2200 for diplomas.
05/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: I would like to correct please!
05/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/02/24, 3:34 pm - +263 78 095 6605: ok please ma’am
05/02/24, 3:34 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Thank you for the help ma’am
05/02/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/02/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/02/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 3:39 pm - +263 78 095 6605: l also learnt that tutorial fees are less India and yet they provide best education in the world which is so amazing
05/02/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Lindiwe!
05/02/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
05/02/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Helping students out with their finances releases financial stress thereby helping them focus less on how they are going to pay and  focus more on their studies. It helps a student to want to achieve more in life with the help she gets from the program.
05/02/24, 3:52 pm - +263 78 095 6605: l understand that earn while you learn program is when a student finds a part time job while he or she is learning and what she gets paid from the part time job helps for his or her upkeep
05/02/24, 3:54 pm - Harmehak: While I thoroughly appreciate your understanding, Lindiwe.

I would like to add that you cannot work in India on a student visa please.
05/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 78 095 6605: it’s ok. as long as one gets to learn.
05/02/24, 3:57 pm - +263 78 095 6605: noted .
thank you ma’am
05/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/02/24, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Thank very much l had misunderstood the Earn While You Learn Program but due to the information shared l now understand thank you ma’am
05/02/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: I am glad it could help.
05/02/24, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/02/24, 4:07 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Thank you for your help.
05/02/24, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/02/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: You will definitely learn more from Persistence's video.
05/02/24, 4:20 pm - +263 78 095 6605: You are indeed different because this teaches students not to be money driven but to be career oriented and work towards achieving their goals
05/02/24, 4:20 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Thank you this was mind opening.
05/02/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

Lindiwe, so now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
05/02/24, 4:25 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Yes l am ready
05/02/24, 4:25 pm - Harmehak: Lindiwe, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/02/24, 4:29 pm - +263 78 095 6605: The student would have spent between $1500-$2250
05/02/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/02/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/02/24, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 4:34 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Noted
05/02/24, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: Lindiwe, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/02/24, 4:36 pm - +263 78 095 6605: lndeed Edoofa is making things easier for international students
05/02/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/02/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/02/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/02/24, 4:40 pm - +263 78 095 6605: understood ma’am
05/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
05/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
05/02/24, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/02/24, 4:43 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Yes ma’am l have understood
05/02/24, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/02/24, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
05/02/24, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

05/02/24, 4:46 pm - +263 78 095 6605: ok thank you ma’am
05/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
05/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
05/02/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 4:48 pm - +263 78 095 6605: ok thank very much let me contact her
05/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, do request your parents to connect as well.
05/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
05/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/02/24, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.

Food is a basic need in human beings and at that it is very hard to attain it.

Big pieces were distributed in order for people to maximize and increase there food supplements. 

It has been proved that Africans have poor diets due to stagnant and inefficient use of land 

Some people hold large pieces of land but they are some areas which are left idle thus less or nothing is produced.

Some farms lands are not put to use due to less or no rainfall at all this is a makes poor food production 

People do not have machinary to work on the pierces of land they have so many farms are stagnant making it very hard for the food production to take place , thus making poor diets 

At some places the main  resource which is land is scarce at this point nothing or less is produced making it hard for black  people to consume the correct amounts of food to stabilize and have a healthy diet therefore leading to poor diet.

Most Africans believe in having more than two children and some rely on farming as a source of food but their farms produce inefficient food  supplies this leads to poor diets due to lack of food .

Some farms do not even produce enough quantities which are needed in food diet , these can also be counted under stagnant farms because they do not help serve in the well being of people. 

When one doesn’t get the correct amount of nutrition needed he ot she is referred to as a consumer of a poor diet the farms are will be inefficient because of producing less of what is needed by a human being .

Most farms are not put to use they are just left unattended to and at the end of the day nothing produced in them and that means that Africans will not get everything they need because most of them rely on their farms for food supplies 
However more can still be produced .



My inspiration Story. 

They say all dreams come true that was what l used to hear l always would look up and admire the true heroes of life whom in my head had achieved everything l desired.

Helping the community had always been a thing of the past . Everyone had always looked after his or her own but but not everything can be like that.

Mrs Lyn had always taken peoples needs as her own she did not have much but l would look at her as she smiled and kept on calling the street kids .

l need my head l was wondering where she got all those things funny enough we were always instilled with a thought that only the rich get to give the poor middle class people only  need to fend for themselves.

We would be constantly invited to her house, the type of things she ownes never screamed l am rich but rather l have sacrificed for the poor to get what l have and we will all be equal.
l struggled to get to school but a teacher would always enter and teach a common subject “ we all need to learn how to get by with the little resources we have “. 

I would always link it with Mrs Lyn constantly sharing the little resources she had .

l  kept wondering if one day that would be me or l would only fend for me and my family.

As l grew older l started envy Mrs Lyn for the things she was doing and from then l decided that if l had to make the little l would share.

That has alwa been my push but with the help of Mrs Lyn as my inspiration l would conquer all challenges.
06/02/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Let me get it evaluated please!
06/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 095 6605: ok thank you
06/02/24, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
06/02/24, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: Lindiwe, While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
06/02/24, 8:06 pm - +263 78 095 6605: Yes ma’am
06/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: Sure Lindiwe!

Dear parents, I believe you must have followed the entire discussion so far!

So, now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Lindiwe's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!

06/02/24, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
06/02/24, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
06/02/24, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
06/02/24, 8:21 pm - +27 72 307 0957: We as parents are behind our daughter, s future we discovered this program helpful and future guaranteed so we're supporting and shall be there for her whenever she needs us
06/02/24, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/02/24, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/02/24, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
06/02/24, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th February 2024 for $200 and the 13th or 14th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 13th or 14th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
06/02/24, 8:28 pm - +27 72 307 0957: We're fanancially prepared to opt for required payment on tentative deadlines
