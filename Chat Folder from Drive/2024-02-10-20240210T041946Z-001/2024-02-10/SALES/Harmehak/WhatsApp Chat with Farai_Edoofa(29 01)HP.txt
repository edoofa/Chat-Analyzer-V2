29/01/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: That's great, however what all did you research regarding the requirements for engineering, Farai?
29/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 71 227 4883: What l discovered is that you need to have at least a strong background mathematics and science and you need to have taken classes of physics
29/01/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
29/01/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Physics and Mathematics are a mandatory requirement to pursue Engineering, Farai!
29/01/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okay l understand
29/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Now considering your subject combination and interests, you can pursue-

*Bachelor of Computer Applications*

*Bachelor of science in computer science*
29/01/24, 3:43 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, between the two l choose *Bachelor of science in computer science*

29/01/24, 3:55 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okay thank you Ms Harmehak, l understand
29/01/24, 4:37 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Farai, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
29/01/24, 5:00 pm - +263 71 227 4883: In the next 5 years, I see myself in the technology industry, using my skills and knowledge to make innovative solutions on to the real world and l believe that with hard work and dedication l can achieve my goals and create my mark in the technology industry
29/01/24, 5:04 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Farai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/01/24, 5:19 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, l discovered that abroad they is more resources that can help me to achieve my goals and target than here in Zimbabwe
29/01/24, 5:25 pm - Harmehak: You see, Farai, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
29/01/24, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Farai!
29/01/24, 5:41 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okayy sure sorry
29/01/24, 5:41 pm - +263 71 227 4883: As for me l can say that in opportunities can come once for a while so if you get a chance you should use it especially when you are here where things can be challenging
29/01/24, 5:43 pm - +263 71 227 4883: And l would also like to thank you for recognizing us as Zimbabwe for helping us in our academics
29/01/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Farai!
29/01/24, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Farai!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
29/01/24, 5:52 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okay sure, on my research l discovered that India is the home to some of the top ranking universities in the world and also l discovered that India's many universities are English speaking which can make it easy for us international students to learn
29/01/24, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to see you did research, Farai!
29/01/24, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

29/01/24, 6:45 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okayy, I'm following
29/01/24, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: I am to know that, Farai!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
29/01/24, 6:56 pm - +263 71 227 4883: My parents can decide the rest but as for me l need scholarship
29/01/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
29/01/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/01/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/01/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/01/24, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 7:02 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okayy, Ms Harmehak I'm following
29/01/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
29/01/24, 7:08 pm - +263 71 227 4883: I think it is a very good program for both students and universities
29/01/24, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
29/01/24, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: Farai, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
29/01/24, 7:13 pm - +263 71 227 4883: I totally agree.
29/01/24, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in an even better place to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Farai?
29/01/24, 7:21 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Yess I'm now in a much better place
29/01/24, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
29/01/24, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/01/24, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
29/01/24, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

29/01/24, 7:32 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okayy, Ms Harmehak l am understanding the system
29/01/24, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: That's good!
29/01/24, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/01/24, 7:40 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, l now how how the earn while you learn program works
29/01/24, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
29/01/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/01/24, 7:47 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Yess, I'm glad to know thank you Ms Harmehak
29/01/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 8:20 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Yes, l now realise
29/01/24, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
29/01/24, 8:33 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Yes, I'm ready
29/01/24, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: Farai, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
29/01/24, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/01/24, 8:37 pm - +263 71 227 4883: $1500-$2250
29/01/24, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/01/24, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/01/24, 8:43 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, lm following
29/01/24, 8:44 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/01/24, 8:46 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Yes, that is correct
29/01/24, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/01/24, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/01/24, 8:49 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/01/24, 8:52 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, Ms Harmehak that is wonderful
29/01/24, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
29/01/24, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
29/01/24, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
29/01/24, 8:58 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Yes, l do understand
29/01/24, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/01/24, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
29/01/24, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
29/01/24, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
29/01/24, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
29/01/24, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 9:07 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Okay, thank you
29/01/24, 9:14 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
29/01/24, 9:14 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
29/01/24, 9:14 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

My inspirational story is about the story of Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google? He's a modern-day pioneer in the field of computer science.
Sergey Brin was born in 1973 and studied computer science at Stanford University. He met Larry Page, who shared his passion for the internet. Together, they founded Google in 1998. Brin played a key role in developing the company's groundbreaking PageRank algorithm, which revolutionized the way we search for information online. Brin and Page also developed many other technologies, including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Translate. Today, Brin continues to work for Google as the president of Google's parent company, Alphabet.The most inspiring about Sergey Brin's story is his determination to pursue his dreams, even when others doubted him. Many people thought his ideas were too radical or impossible to achieve. But Brin didn't give up, and he went on to change the way we use the internet. He also used his success to help others, donating millions of dollars to causes like health and education.

No, that is not true. There are many factors that contribute to poor diets in Africa, including poverty, lack of access to nutritious food, and cultural beliefs about food. While agricultural productivity is one factor, it's not the only one. And in some cases, farming methods may be inefficient not because they're stagnant, but because they're limited by factors like access to technology, water, and fertilizer. So it's not as simple as saying that farms are stagnant and inefficient, and there's a lot more that goes into this issue.

Furthermore, African farmers don't have access to the latest farming technologies, like hybrid seeds, irrigation systems, and fertilizer. Without these technologies, it's difficult to increase agricultural productivity and improve diets. Another challenge is that many farmers in Africa rely on rain-fed agriculture, which can be unreliable and lead to crop failure in times of drought. This is especially problematic in countries like Ethiopia and Somalia, where droughts are common. Finally, cultural beliefs about food can also play a role in poor diets. For example, in some parts of Africa, certain foods like eggs and dairy products are considered to be for children.

Another challenge facing African farmers is the lack of access to markets. In many cases, farmers have to sell their crops to local middlemen, who then sell the crops to urban markets. This means that farmers often don't get a fair price for their crops, and the lack of access to markets can lead to food insecurity. Additionally, farmers may not have access to information about market prices or the best practices for growing their crops. All of these factors can contribute to poor diets in Africa. So it is not as simple as saying that farms are stagnant and inefficient.

Also, Africans have poor diets because they cannot afford nutritious and healthy foods, not because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. The primary cause of hunger in Africa is rural poverty, not food shortages. And policy interventions should focus more on the demand side of the food system, rather than the supply side, to improve the dietary diversity and quality of Africans.

On another research l discovered how some policies, such as the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), have undermined the crop diversity of African farmers by promoting commercial seeds and fertilizers for starchy crops, such as maize and rice. And now l suggest that what African farmers need most is crop diversity, which improves their diet diversity.

The majority of the hungry in Africa are rural, most living off crops they grow for subsistence and for sale. Even though they can’t afford expensive commercial seeds and fertilizers, donors have been pushing such inputs across the region.

30/01/24, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: Farai, While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
30/01/24, 6:51 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Evening, Ms Harmehak
30/01/24, 6:53 pm - +263 71 485 0333: Yes lam following
30/01/24, 6:53 pm - +263 71 227 4883: Yes, I am following
30/01/24, 6:55 pm - Harmehak: Dear parent, kindly acknowledge if you are willing to support Farai's higher education in India mentally and financially, using a voice note please!
30/01/24, 6:59 pm - +263 71 485 0333: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
30/01/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
30/01/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
30/01/24, 7:05 pm - +263 71 485 0333: I agree with you
30/01/24, 7:06 pm - +263 71 485 0333: Yes l am willing to support him
30/01/24, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
30/01/24, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
30/01/24, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

30/01/24, 7:20 pm - +263 71 485 0333: Yes l will pay it
30/01/24, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your support.
30/01/24, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 5th or 6th February 2024 for $200 and the 5th or 6th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 5th or 6th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
30/01/24, 7:27 pm - +263 71 485 0333: No 1
30/01/24, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: Kindly acknowledge using a voice note and if you are financially prepared for the same.

05/02/24, 2:44 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome Mr Chiromba.

I sincerely appreciate your kind words please.
05/02/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
05/02/24, 2:50 pm - +971 52 850 5495: Welcome, now the duty is on us as parents to provide the fundamental
05/02/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your thorough support for Farai!
05/02/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Mr Chiromba, since you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account (Mr. Charles Jerera) over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
05/02/24, 2:54 pm - +971 52 850 5495: I thing direct into your parent company account will be convenient
05/02/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Mr Chiromba, talking about the first mode, which is the Direct Bank transfer in our Account, basically because of the cash crisis in Zimbabwe, there are a limited Banks which allow International Transfer. These Banks are Barclays Bank and CBZ Bank, Nedbank and FBC Bank. If you have an account in any of these Banks then the transaction charges will then be $100 to $120 USD for any amount upto $1000 depending upon the bank. Please note that $350 should also be in USD. In case you have Zimbabwean Dollars, you will have to exchange that with USD and transfer charges on *every transaction* would also be $100 to $120.

Therefore, the Bank Details that are to be used in this mode are:

Swift code: AXISINBB207
IFSC code: UTIB0001147
Bank Name: Axis Bank Ltd.
Account Name: Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
Current Account Number: 917020070183626
Bank's Name:  Axis Bank Ltd.
Bank’s Address: Janakpuri, B Block, New Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058
05/02/24, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: However if you have international cards and you wish to use the same, you can inform me please.
05/02/24, 3:01 pm - +971 52 850 5495: It’s ok, I will
05/02/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: For your convenience, shall I brief you about you about the second mode as well?
05/02/24, 3:03 pm - +971 52 850 5495: With my pleasure
05/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
05/02/24, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

05/02/24, 3:35 pm - +971 52 850 5495: The reason why I have chosen 1 first option it’s because I wanted to deposit here in Dubai
05/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Sure, Mr Chiromba!

You can do so using your international card for PayPal Invoice as that would be more convenient for you.
