What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

After interacting with one of the student beneficiary if Edoofa Schoolarship i learnt so much about the advantages of being part of the program . To begin with, Edoofa Program as a well appreciated organisation which carters for student welfare and education. It offers schoolarships and makes education affordable for African students. According to my research , Edoofians  gain more skills in through preparing for the corporate world . 

Most importantly through Edoofa  , i can earn scholarship credits through. Earn While You Learn Program which makes education way more affordable as you can fund your own fees. I also learnt that India is a very friendly community,provides quality education and has cruisanes and very exciting places to  explore which is why i cant wait to be part of the Edoofa Program so that i can visit the places , learn and understand their culture .


Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?

I should be accepted into the Edoofa Program so that i can be able to further my studies and get better  job opportunities in the future.  I should also be a part of the Edoofa Program so that i can experience the process introduce it to more students both privileged and non privileged  and be able to provide full detail out of experience thus changing our zimbabwean society into a literate society.
