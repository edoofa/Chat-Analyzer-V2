02/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 588 7387: I understand now why Edoofa is the best
02/02/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 822 0336: I get the truth of Edoofa as the best and even the way it makes to be successful and I am inspired or enlighten with the spirit of excellent by Edoofa...
02/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Wonderful
02/02/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, please!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
02/02/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 588 7387: We dont have but we  need scholarship
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/02/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/02/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 588 7387: I understand but I have question can I ask now
02/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if he is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, he would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
02/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
02/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Alright
02/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Alright
02/02/24, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the costs after the higher quantum of scholarship, please?
02/02/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 588 7387: I will not say more I just say this is good affordable
02/02/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 588 7387: What about if you give us Scholarship then we we want to apply for loan for remaining balance I will be given or not
02/02/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please.

Can you rephrase?
02/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 588 7387: Okay my question is that Can I apply for a loan for remaining  tuition fees after Scholarship
02/02/24, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: You wish to apply for a loan where exactly please?
02/02/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 588 7387: From EDOOFA
02/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: We only assist with Scholarship on tuition fee, Mrs Idah.
02/02/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 588 7387: Okay
02/02/24, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: You see, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 77 588 7387: I agree
02/02/24, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: So now that you have compared the costs of those in Zimbabwe and in India!

Are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mrs Idah?
02/02/24, 3:47 pm - +263 77 588 7387: 100% Yes
02/02/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: So now that you are aware of the costs, are you and Mr Stephen willing to support Blessed financially?
02/02/24, 4:09 pm - +263 77 588 7387: Yes
02/02/24, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

So what is your financial plan to support, Blessed?
02/02/24, 6:47 pm - +263 77 588 7387: I'm working and also doing farming
02/02/24, 6:51 pm - +263 77 588 7387: We also buy and selling goods
02/02/24, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
02/02/24, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response earlier, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
02/02/24, 9:16 pm - +263 77 588 7387: Sorry for late  to respond due to the fact of network problem.
02/02/24, 9:32 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
03/02/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
03/02/24, 10:03 am - Harmehak: I would like to share an exciting news that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*
03/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 822 0336: Morning we are so sorry for the network problem and Idarh 's app is banned so we are so sorry I will try my best to get connected and respond every time and again...
03/02/24, 10:34 am - +263 77 822 0336: Sure
03/02/24, 10:34 am - Harmehak: I do understand please!
03/02/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 822 0336: Wow thank you so much we promise since you have a heart with us... We are celebrating for your arrival...

03/02/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Mr Stephen!
03/02/24, 10:40 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
03/02/24, 10:40 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
03/02/24, 10:40 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/02/24, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

03/02/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 822 0336: Alright
03/02/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
03/02/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: You can go through the information to learn about the EWYL Program!
03/02/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 822 0336: So interesting to hear.
03/02/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 822 0336: Well organized and I see a bright future and a luxurious way of living.
03/02/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
03/02/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 77 822 0336: We are being encouraged and gain life from being a dead and dry bones we are getting and receiving hope and strength in this world..
03/02/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 822 0336: This program is the best one as I am learning and reading it brings light from darkness
03/02/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: I appreciate that this could help!
03/02/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/02/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 822 0336: True it helps too much as I am now a changed person for the light you are bringing to our family
03/02/24, 11:53 am - +263 77 822 0336: Yes please my dear
03/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Very correct I see it.
03/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Interesting and a well done work.
03/02/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
03/02/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Alright My dear I like it..
03/02/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Mr Stephen, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
03/02/24, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
03/02/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Alright I am learning and listening my dear..
03/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
03/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
03/02/24, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
03/02/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 822 0336: An average of $1500-$2250
03/02/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/02/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
03/02/24, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 822 0336: You are very correct
03/02/24, 1:52 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Edoofa is always the best as I see it even from the beginning of this study and it makes things easier for the parents meaning to stay there is a special offer and much cheaper or care for the life of students to be easy and affordable
03/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words please!
03/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
03/02/24, 2:45 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Yes I see it and there is a heart as more than of us as parents because sometimes parents might wish to create a special standard for children but because of the cost of living we end up failing to achieve all the goals of life but at the side of Edoofa I see it as the great giant mother figure head (Edoofa the world motherhood) there is a potential and motivation...
03/02/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
03/02/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
03/02/24, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/02/24, 2:48 pm - +263 77 822 0336: I like this idea and the spirit of excellent as I see it..
03/02/24, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
03/02/24, 2:52 pm - +263 77 822 0336: May God continue pouring his blessings to you for the love and care of students and parents to maintain their lives so touch...
03/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Amen!
03/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
03/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
03/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Alright I will do so
03/02/24, 2:54 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Here am I
03/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Well organized and professional
03/02/24, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
03/02/24, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
03/02/24, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
03/02/24, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
03/02/24, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 822 0336: I see wisdom and inspiration even the spirit of intelligence is well provided for sure
03/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 77 822 0336: That is great
03/02/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
03/02/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
03/02/24, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/02/24, 3:03 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Wonderful
03/02/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 822 0336: Thank you very much my dear
03/02/24, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: Do connect with Mrs Ruth.
03/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
03/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
03/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

03/02/24, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.✓✓

a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.✓✓
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.✓✓
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.✓✓
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness✓✓
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

05/02/24, 10:05 pm - Harmehak: Received, Blessed!

Let me get it evaluated!
06/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Good morning Everyone , I hope you are doing well!
06/02/24, 9:35 am - +263 77 588 7387: Morning
06/02/24, 9:37 am - Harmehak: Mrs Idah, I have Blessed's interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you be online for the next 20 minutes?
06/02/24, 9:39 am - +263 77 588 7387: Okay
06/02/24, 9:41 am - Harmehak: Mrs Idah, I believe you must have followed the entire discussion so far!

So now given the finances and the entire details of the program, I would like to know if you are willing to support Blessed's higher education in India both mentally and financially please?

If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note!
06/02/24, 9:42 am - +263 77 588 7387: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Well received please, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
06/02/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
06/02/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
06/02/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 588 7387: Yes I am willing
06/02/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
06/02/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
06/02/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
06/02/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 9:47 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th February 2024 for $200 and the 13th or 14th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 13th or 14th February 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
06/02/24, 9:53 am - +263 77 588 7387: I opt number 1
06/02/24, 9:54 am - Harmehak: Could you please acknowledge the same using a voice note and if you are financially prepared for the same?
06/02/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 588 7387: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Duly noted, I do appreciate your support for Blessed,

So now you would be connecting with the Program Director for a video call interview!

After the same Blessed will have a technical round!

Shall we begin with the same?
06/02/24, 10:14 am - +263 77 588 7387: Okay
06/02/24, 10:33 am - Harmehak: Blessed kindly introduce yourself in the group as well!
