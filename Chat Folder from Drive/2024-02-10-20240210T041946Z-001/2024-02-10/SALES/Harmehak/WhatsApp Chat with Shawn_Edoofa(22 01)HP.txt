24/01/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Are you following the discussion too, Shawn?
24/01/24, 1:26 pm - +263 71 380 0300: Yes I am
24/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Thank you very much I now have the knowledge of the program
24/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
24/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: That's great
24/01/24, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Fortunate, now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
24/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Is the scholarship affordable to those who are civil servants like us and does it give a 100 %  coverage on the program to be undertaken
24/01/24, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate your understanding of a 100% coverage please?
24/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Okay ,like covering the tuition fees and some travelling expenses
24/01/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
24/01/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok great explanation I now understand.so how does this scholarship work in terms of what you are supposed to pay let's say you got the scholarship
24/01/24, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: We will discuss the same in detail throughout our discussion please.
24/01/24, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, let us discuss as to why Edoofa recommends India, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* India is home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education. Students can choose from a wide range of disciplines, including politics, philosophy, engineering, medical sciences, biology, business, and media/journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* Indian universities emphasize a rigorous academic curriculum that combines theoretical knowledge with practical skill development. Students have opportunities for cutting-edge research projects and collaboration with experts.

4. *Faculty Expertise:* The faculty members in Indian institutions are highly qualified and bring industry expertise to the classroom. They provide quality instruction, mentorship, and guidance to nurture students' academic and professional growth.

5. *Global Recognition and Career Prospects:* Indian degrees are globally recognized, opening doors to a wide range of career opportunities worldwide. Graduates from Indian institutions have achieved success in various fields globally.

6. *Cultural Diversity and Vibrant Campus Life:* India's educational institutions celebrate cultural diversity, providing students with a multicultural environment. Additionally, students can engage in vibrant campus life, participate in cultural festivals, and experience the rich heritage of India.

7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* Studying in India is more affordable compared to many renowned institutions worldwide. The cost of education is lower, and various scholarships, loans, and financial assistance programs are available to support students.

8. *English Medium of Instruction:* English is widely used as a medium of instruction in Indian universities, ensuring a comfortable learning experience for international students.

9. *Research and Innovation Opportunities:* Indian institutions offer opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge research and innovation. They can collaborate with experts, contribute to advancements in their fields, and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Let me also show you some facts about India and several global leaders who are Indian graduates.

24/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: You can thoroughly go through the shared resources please.
24/01/24, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Do you believe studying in India would help Shawn build a great future like our other Proud Edoofians, Mrs Fortunate?
24/01/24, 4:16 pm - +263 71 528 7284: It indeed excellent
24/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Yes I do believe from what I'm seeing and reading and all the proof
24/01/24, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mrs Fortunate.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
24/01/24, 4:20 pm - +263 71 528 7284: For now we are not familiar with the costs of higher education without any scholarship .
24/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
24/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 4:51 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Thank you ,so the cost can be USD 2000 to USD$3000 per year  when enrolled at your institutionbon scholarship
24/01/24, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Fortunate, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if he is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, he would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
24/01/24, 4:59 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok  it's
24/01/24, 5:00 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Great
24/01/24, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
24/01/24, 5:17 pm - +263 71 528 7284: So far so good
24/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
24/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
24/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
24/01/24, 5:23 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

24/01/24, 5:42 pm - +263 71 528 7284: That interesting so the EWYL is done when you are at the campus .
24/01/24, 5:43 pm - +263 71 528 7284: That's
24/01/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: The students start with their Earn While You Learn Program from Zimbabwe itself and continue online throughout their degree even after coming to India.
24/01/24, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/01/24, 5:47 pm - +263 71 528 7284: The EWYL is done when you have got the scholarship?
24/01/24, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

After Shaun is accepted into the program, within a few days he will start with his EWYL program.
24/01/24, 5:49 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Fortunate, are you aware of Shawn's friend Kudzaiishe who is currently in India as a part of the Edoofa program?
24/01/24, 5:51 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok
24/01/24, 5:52 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Yes he told me but I don't know the name of the friend actually
24/01/24, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: I understand, you can request Shawn to connect you with Kudzaiishe as well!
24/01/24, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

24/01/24, 6:03 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok  I will do so
24/01/24, 6:07 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Yes ,I do see now that you are different its good
24/01/24, 6:09 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So Mrs Fortunate now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be active for the next 15-20 minutes itself. 

Are you ready?
24/01/24, 6:41 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Yes
24/01/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Fortunate, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
24/01/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/01/24, 6:47 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok about $1500_$2250
24/01/24, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
24/01/24, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
24/01/24, 6:53 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok
24/01/24, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Fortunate, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
24/01/24, 6:55 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Yes I do
24/01/24, 6:56 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
24/01/24, 6:56 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 6:56 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/01/24, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
24/01/24, 7:05 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok I understand
24/01/24, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
24/01/24, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
24/01/24, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
24/01/24, 7:08 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Yes I have understood the steps
24/01/24, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate you thoroughly following the entire discussion.
24/01/24, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/01/24, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
24/01/24, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

24/01/24, 7:12 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok I see
24/01/24, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
24/01/24, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
24/01/24, 7:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 7:14 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok thank you
24/01/24, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: Do connect with Mrs Ruth, Mrs Fortunate.

Along with the same you can ask Shawn to connect you with Kudzaiishe since he is currently in India as well.
24/01/24, 7:15 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok thank you will contact her
24/01/24, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

As of now do you have any queries for me?
24/01/24, 7:16 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok will contact kudzai too
24/01/24, 7:17 pm - +263 71 528 7284: No so far I'm satisfied
24/01/24, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, please.

I would like to share with you that we have students from Shawn's school St John's as a part of the Edoofa program as well, Mrs Fortunate.
24/01/24, 7:21 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok
24/01/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
24/01/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
24/01/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

24/01/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: Dear Parents and Shawn,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “25-01-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
24/01/24, 7:24 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok thank you for this session I greatly appreciate
24/01/24, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
24/01/24, 7:26 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Thank very much
24/01/24, 7:28 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Thank you very much
25/01/24, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Good Morning, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
25/01/24, 11:35 am - +263 71 528 7284: We discussed but something came up he is going to work this year and will apply next year sorry for the inconveniences
25/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate as to what exactly happened Mrs Fortunate?
25/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 71 528 7284: We have decided to let him work so that he can  earn and help in the payments of some the expenses  and I understood that  we have to be much much prepared financial
25/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: I understand!
25/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: Mrs Fortunate, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
25/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 71 528 7284: Yes I do agree so that's why we have decided to let him work for now until next year .we have done some calculations and we saw that we are still lagging behind and on the other hand an immediate family needs help so it has foiled the whole process
25/01/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: While I completely understand what you are sharing Mrs Fortunate.

I hope you equally realise that the opportunity he has with the costs being offered at higher quantum of scholarship?
25/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 71 528 7284: I completely understand and if there could be a way I could have find some means so that he gets the scholarship but right now we are now in a tight spot
25/01/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I hope you are aware that you are the opportunity to enroll him for 2025 intake as well please?

As we are expected to close 2024 intake shortly, students are already reserving seats for 2025 intake.
25/01/24, 12:10 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok I'm aware so I have decided to do the application process next year
25/01/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: The application process will be done now itself for 2025 intake please.
25/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 71 528 7284: So I think for now I cannot do it because since some money has to be paid for application and other things during the application process and enrolment .so I think I will be able to do that after the 2024_2025 process .I think and pray that by then the problem we have just met will be over.
25/01/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

As per you how much are the current Finances required for 2025 intake as of right now, Mrs Fortunate?
25/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 71 528 7284: From my understanding about 2000_3000
25/01/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: No please!
25/01/24, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: I hope you recall that the fee after the higher quantum of scholarship is $1200-1800, Mrs Fortunate?
25/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Per year sorry
25/01/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: The $1200-1800 is inclusive of Tuition fee, Food , Accomodation and basic university expenses like Library, Laundry, Gym, Wifi!
25/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok how about the travelling expenses,visa and other documents.so that is why I said some of my savings has gone to assist a relative.tThat is why we have decided to stop the process for now
25/01/24, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Fortunate I suggested for you to opt for 2025 intake considering the same itself!

If you proceed with Shawn's application now.

If he is found eligible you would initially paying $200 only.

After the same Shawn can proceed ahead with the Earn While You Learn Program.
25/01/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: I believe you understand if he starts with Earn While You Learn Program he can earn credits for higher education directly rather than having to work there in Zimbabwe.
25/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok  I will get back to you when I discuss it with the family
25/01/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!

Meanwhile, did you happen to connect with Mrs Ruth?
25/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Not yet but definitely today
25/01/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: I shall appreciate if you can connect, Mrs Fortunate.

This is Kudzaiishe's contact if you wish to contact.
25/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 71 528 7284: Ok thank you
25/01/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
