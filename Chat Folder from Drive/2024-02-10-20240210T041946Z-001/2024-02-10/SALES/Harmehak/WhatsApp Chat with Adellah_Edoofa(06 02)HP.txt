I must definitely congratulate you on your A level results as well!
07/02/24, 10:52 am - +263 78 977 6655: Thank you ma'am
07/02/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Adellah, could you please share your O and A level results in a picture format?
07/02/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 977 6655: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 977 6655: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Received please!
07/02/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: So what motivates you to study Medicine, Adellah?
07/02/24, 11:03 am - +263 78 977 6655: I basically want to assist people medically where I get to have a direct interaction with people and medicine is the only program that you get to interact with people and assist them medically
07/02/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 977 6655: And have had experience of being in a hospital and i just like the experience
07/02/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: I do understand, Adellah!

So did you ever happen to come cross somebody from your family or friends who is purusing Medicine in Zimbabwe or India?
07/02/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 977 6655: Yeah I have a friend she did medicine in Zimbabwe she recently started working
07/02/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Oh that's wonderful!
07/02/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: So did you ever also happen to research about the requirements for Medicine in India please? <This message was edited>
07/02/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 977 6655: Yes i did first there is the exam that you have to write then once you pass then you can study medicine
07/02/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Alright please!

So what's your take on the importance of Physics in your A level, Adellah, considering its a science subject itself!
07/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 977 6655: I feel physics is important if you want to do engineering but for medical programs i feel biology and chemistry are the important subjects
07/02/24, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
07/02/24, 11:33 am - +263 78 977 6655: Yes i did research on that
07/02/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
07/02/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
07/02/24, 11:36 am - Harmehak: If a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology or Cardiovascular Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.

Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.

Cardiovascular Technology involves the use of non-invasive procedures to diagnose and treat heart and blood vessel disorders. This field requires a strong foundation in biology and anatomy and offers courses in electrocardiography, echocardiography, and vascular technology. Students with a degree in Cardiovascular Technology can work in hospitals and clinics and can gain valuable experience in the field of cardiology.

Both Medical Laboratory Technology and Cardiovascular Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in one of these fields is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially. <This message was edited>
07/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 78 977 6655: Ok i understand that will try and think about that
07/02/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: Now, If you have a bachelor's degree in Medical Laboratory Technology or Cardiovascular Technology from India and are interested in pursuing further studies in medicine, you may consider the following options:

1. **Doctor of Medicine (MD):**
   - MD is a postgraduate degree that medical professionals pursue to specialize in a specific field of medicine. Specializations can include internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, radiology, pathology, etc.

2. **Master of Surgery (MS):**
   - Similar to MD, MS is a postgraduate degree that focuses on surgical specialties. Surgeons typically pursue this degree to specialize in areas such as general surgery, orthopedics, ophthalmology, etc.

3. **Diplomate of National Board (DNB):**
   - DNB is a postgraduate or postdoctoral degree in various medical specialties. It is offered by the National Board of Examinations in India and is equivalent to MD or MS.

4. **Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Pathology (DCP):**
   - This is a diploma program that focuses on clinical pathology and is suitable for individuals with a background in laboratory technology.

5. **Masters in Public Health (MPH):**
   - If you are interested in public health, an MPH degree could be a good option. It covers a range of topics including epidemiology, health policy, biostatistics, and environmental health.

6. **Hospital Management/Administration:**
   - You may consider pursuing a Master's in Hospital Administration or Healthcare Management to take on administrative roles in healthcare organizations.

It's important to note that the specific options available to you may depend on the admission requirements of the medical schools or universities in the country where you plan to pursue further studies. Additionally, some countries may have specific requirements for international medical graduates, so it's advisable to research the admission criteria for the institutions you're interested in.

Keep in mind that different countries may have different systems of medical education, and the nomenclature of degrees may vary. It's crucial to carefully research and understand the educational and licensing requirements of the country in which you plan to practice medicine.
07/02/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 977 6655: And how many years will the medical lab technology take
07/02/24, 11:42 am - Harmehak: Adellah it takes 3 years for MLT and  2 or 3 years for a postgraduate degree depending on the degree you opt for.
07/02/24, 11:43 am - +263 78 977 6655: Ok so it's about six years in total
07/02/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: 5 or 6 years please!
07/02/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 977 6655: Ok ma'am
07/02/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: So far, what all would you like to ask, Adellh?
07/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 78 977 6655: So if i do MLT do i still have to take the exam
07/02/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: Which exam are you referring to, Adellah?
07/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 78 977 6655: The NEET exam
07/02/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: NEET exam is given by those who have Biology, Physics and Chemistry in their A level to pursue medicine.
07/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 977 6655: Ok it's fine
07/02/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Were you able to go through the same as well, Adellah?

08/02/24, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Adellah, did you manage to connect with any of these students?
08/02/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 977 6655: No not yet
08/02/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright,

While I believe there are questions associated to your discussion, Adellah!

May I know what is going on in your mind currently?

Do you have any queries or doubts?
08/02/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 977 6655: Yeah i have doubts because as someone who wanted medicine the change I'm not that sure if i want to go through with this
08/02/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Adellah, this is why I have been asking time and again if you have any queries!
08/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 977 6655: The conversion from medicine to MLT in Zimbabwe there is a big difference between the two
08/02/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Lee-Ann as I mentioned already physics is a strict requirement for Physics.
08/02/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: After completing your Bachelors you can pursue Doctor of Medicine or Masters of Surgery for example!
08/02/24, 1:27 pm - +263 78 977 6655: Yes i understand ma'am
08/02/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understand that even in Zimbabwe you will have to first puruse an undergrad prerequisite into Medicine!
08/02/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 977 6655: In Zimbabwe you go to university and do the program and it takes 6 years
08/02/24, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Firstly you would be pursuing  Biomedical Sciences which is an undergrad prerequisite into MBChB in Zimbabwe.

You cannot be accepted into MBChB without an undergrad prerequisite, Adellah.

Where you will spend close to 6-8 years to later on first gain experience as well before working.
09/02/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/02/24, 10:00 am - +263 77 802 9339: Yes
09/02/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: Have you been able to follow the entire discussion, Mr Collins?
09/02/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 802 9339: Yes I ve been following & have seen that it's the same process that is done both here in Zimbabwe & India to get to enrol for medicine
09/02/24, 10:18 am - +263 77 802 9339: Now my big question is how much is the process in terms of finances to get to India & start learning
09/02/24, 10:19 am - +263 77 802 9339: Air tickets,accommodation there the fees etc
09/02/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Sure please!
09/02/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Mr Collins, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
09/02/24, 10:21 am - +263 77 802 9339: Not at all
09/02/24, 10:21 am - +263 77 802 9339: No idea
09/02/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Alright please!
09/02/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
09/02/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/02/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/02/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 802 9339: OK uuuh quite affordable
09/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Collins, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
09/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
09/02/24, 10:40 am - +263 77 802 9339: Ok
09/02/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same, Mr Collins?
09/02/24, 10:45 am - +263 77 802 9339: I accept the offer if it comes true
09/02/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Considering her results in A level, we definitely look forward to the same,

*As if she is able to perform and clear the interview and test criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*,
09/02/24, 10:54 am - +263 77 802 9339: OK thank you
09/02/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Did you happen to have a discussion with Adellah regarding the course, Mr Collins?
09/02/24, 11:16 am - +263 77 802 9339: Not yet will meet her next week
09/02/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please!
09/02/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 802 9339: Yes
09/02/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Mr Collins, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
09/02/24, 11:18 am - +263 77 802 9339: True
09/02/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: So now given the finances in India, are you in a better position relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
09/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 77 802 9339: Yes indeed
09/02/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
09/02/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
09/02/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
09/02/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

09/02/24, 12:53 pm - +263 77 802 9339: Ok
09/02/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
09/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 77 802 9339: Follo
09/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 77 802 9339: Am following
09/02/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: I hope you have a better clarity regarding the Earn While You Learn Program, Mr Collins?
09/02/24, 1:02 pm - +263 77 802 9339: Yes
09/02/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: Mr Collins, did you so far get a chance to connect with any of these students or their parents from St Davids?
09/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 802 9339: Not yet
09/02/24, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

By the end of our discussion I will personally connect you to a parent who has children in India!
09/02/24, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

09/02/24, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: So as we close the day, let's reflect on this powerful quote from Proverbs 3:13-14:

*"Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold."*
09/02/24, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: I would appreciate a clear communication from your end regarding the challenges being faced since you haven't been participating properly!
