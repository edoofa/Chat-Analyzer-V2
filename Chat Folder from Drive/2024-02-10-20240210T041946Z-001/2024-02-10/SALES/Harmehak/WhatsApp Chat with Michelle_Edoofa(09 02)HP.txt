What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
Edoofa is a new program that allows international students to study at top universities in lndia . The program is designed to help students who would otherwise not have the opportunity to study in India, by providing them with financial support and assistance with the application process. Edoofa is unique because it is not a scholarship program, but rather a comprehensive support system that helps students every step of the way. From finding the right school to securing funding and housing, Edoofa is there to help.


Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
I think l should be accepted to Edoofa Program because am a dedicated student when it comes to studies and also am actually coming from a family which can't afford to help.e to further my studies because of being financial unstable.

09/02/24, 6:37 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Indian origin CEOs are men only which literary gives me goosebumps because am a female
09/02/24, 6:38 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Michelle!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
09/02/24, 6:40 pm - +263 71 148 9223: As for me and my family members  we  are not yet aware of the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any schoolarship in India itself <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
09/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
09/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/02/24, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 6:44 pm - +263 71 148 9223: This is something wonderful, Edoofa I such a helpful program world wide and l have noticed that costs in India are not very expensive compared to other countries and even Edoofa has tried to play a big role
09/02/24, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
09/02/24, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Michelle, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
09/02/24, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
09/02/24, 6:47 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Understood
09/02/24, 6:48 pm - +263 71 148 9223: This is such a helpful program indeed!
09/02/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please!
09/02/24, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: Michelle, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
09/02/24, 6:51 pm - +263 71 148 9223: That's definitely true
09/02/24, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Michelle?

Along with an opportunity like the *Earn While You Learn Program*!
09/02/24, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation.
09/02/24, 7:14 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Sorry for late reply l had poor connection
09/02/24, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
09/02/24, 7:15 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Yes sure it does make life better for those who can't afford to pay their educational fee
09/02/24, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
09/02/24, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
09/02/24, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
09/02/24, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

09/02/24, 7:21 pm - +263 71 148 9223: This is incredible
I have noticed it teaches students to know how to do business and get their own money whilst they are still learning
09/02/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct!
09/02/24, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
09/02/24, 7:23 pm - +263 71 148 9223: This sounds very helpful and am now inspired
09/02/24, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

09/02/24, 7:29 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Earn while you learn program surely helps a student
09/02/24, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
09/02/24, 7:33 pm - +263 71 148 9223: I understand
09/02/24, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: So far, would you like to ask anything?
09/02/24, 7:37 pm - +263 71 148 9223: You said all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways , which include: 

Students will work on EWYL program having a head start

Does that mean that the student will have to start that program before going to India or after
09/02/24, 7:39 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, you have the privilege to start the Earn While You Learn Program while you are still in Zimbabwe.

If all goes well you would begin with the Earn While You Learn Program in February itself!
09/02/24, 7:40 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Ok l understand, meaning you would probably guide me through all that process
09/02/24, 7:41 pm - +263 71 148 9223: So what l would be earning will be kept for 2025 or it will be mine
09/02/24, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!

We will discuss now itself!
09/02/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: It will be yours and will be submitted directly to the university for your education.

You would have thorough awareness of your credits.
09/02/24, 7:42 pm - +263 71 148 9223: ok understood
09/02/24, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: I would like to share an exciting news that, *We will be visiting Zimbabwe this month to prepare our Edoofians for the journey ahead and we look forward to you being a part of the mega seminar for aspirants.*

While, the expected dates of the seminar are between 17th-19th February 2024.

The venue will be Martin Luther King Jr School, Harare.
09/02/24, 7:42 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Ok got it
09/02/24, 7:43 pm - +263 71 148 9223: That would be great but what about those who are still at school
09/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: You can request your parents to visit.
09/02/24, 7:45 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Ok understood
09/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
09/02/24, 7:46 pm - +263 71 148 9223: But if am gonna be accepted by the program, meaning l will get a letter confirming that l have been accepted right
09/02/24, 7:46 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Yes l am
09/02/24, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Yes please! <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Michelle, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
09/02/24, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
09/02/24, 7:48 pm - +263 71 148 9223: It will cost something like $1500-$2250
09/02/24, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
09/02/24, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
09/02/24, 7:49 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Got it
09/02/24, 7:51 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Meaning that a student with Edoofa program will just have to pay$350
09/02/24, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
09/02/24, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: Michelle, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
09/02/24, 7:52 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Yes it definitely does
09/02/24, 7:53 pm - +263 71 148 9223: That payment made it covers for everything without paying it in small amount, l get it
09/02/24, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
09/02/24, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
09/02/24, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/02/24, 7:55 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Am still following and l do understand
09/02/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
09/02/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
09/02/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
09/02/24, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
09/02/24, 7:57 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Counseling and interview are done online or one on one
09/02/24, 7:58 pm - +263 71 148 9223: Oh sorry l now understand everything as you have classified above
09/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: Currently we are at stage 1 itself.

The interview is done online too!
09/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
09/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
09/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “10-02-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

09/02/24, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: So as we close the day, let's reflect on this powerful quote from Proverbs 3:13-14:

*"Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold."*

I wish you all a blessed evening ahead!
