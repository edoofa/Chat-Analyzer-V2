Unfortunately, l haven't been to this field since l completed my course due to poor communication , required experience or poor cordination with the Demining companies on the ground. Currently l am working for a local clinic where l am earning less than USD200, which is far far beyond to meet the monthly basic needs.

We are a family of 6 members, my self, my wife Portia 43 and our 4 daughters Shallome 22, Shammah 17, Nissi 12 a grade 6 student and Qannah 1year respectively. We are christians follows under United Methodist church.

As Shammah , we are expecting her to have better education for her to bright future. We wish as parents to send her to school but we are failing to do so due to poor earning we get monthly. With the current situation we have as country things are tough to make ends meet. We are and will be happy if she manage to get this scholarship. Let the sky be the limit to her. Shammah is a good girl , responsible, humble , a christian , a hardworker if she has the required items and many more good attitudes.
