I'm a interested in humanitarian subjects such as English literature family religious studies and history which happens to be my major subjects in advanced level.
Although I have  few difficulties in my studies my facilitator made me understand that humanitarian studies is a skill that develop with time contrary with STEM subjects and Commercial studies and I'm developing the skill in a remarkable way. I have been very passionate about being a Lawyer that when I was studying my ordinary level I focus on my strength (humanitarians) rather than my weakness (STEM) and I look forward to persue and became a lawyer. 

Whenever I'm free I enjoy watching shows like judge Judy and reading novels. 

My mother and father separated long back when I was a toddler. 
My father is a self employed man who covers my school fees and my personal needs
