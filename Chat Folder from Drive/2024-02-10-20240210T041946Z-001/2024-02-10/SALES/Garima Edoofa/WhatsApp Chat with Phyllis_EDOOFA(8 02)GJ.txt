08/02/24, 6:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
09/02/24, 9:10 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning, hope you all are doing well.

I would like to inform you, due to some urgent meeting we will commence the session at 10:30 AM CAT.
09/02/24, 8:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
