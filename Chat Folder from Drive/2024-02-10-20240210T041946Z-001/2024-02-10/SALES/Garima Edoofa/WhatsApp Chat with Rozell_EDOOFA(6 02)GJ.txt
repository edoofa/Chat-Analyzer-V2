09/02/24, 12:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Great.
09/02/24, 12:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
09/02/24, 1:01 pm - +263 71 984 3143: Well understood Ms Garima
09/02/24, 1:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright! So going through your results which you've shared, I would recommend a course for you by analysis of your hobbies passion and career inclination and my expertise so the course is
 *Bachelor Of Arts In Law And Legislative*
So may I know does this course aligns you and May I know if you've managed to do any research about this course, please?
09/02/24, 7:09 pm - +263 71 984 3143: Good evening
09/02/24, 7:10 pm - +263 71 984 3143: Yes I did a few research about it
09/02/24, 7:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, shall I brief you about the course?
09/02/24, 8:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time.
