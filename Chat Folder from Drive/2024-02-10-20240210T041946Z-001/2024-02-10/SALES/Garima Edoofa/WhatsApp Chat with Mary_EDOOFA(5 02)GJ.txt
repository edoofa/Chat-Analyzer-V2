So in order to qualify for it there are certain eligibility criterias. 

It is compulsory that a student has Physics, chemistry and Biology for the same. 

Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for some of the Medical Science courses related to Medical Doctor, Surgeon, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Physiotherapy but considering your interest there are similar courses from the Medical Field which you are eligible for such as
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

*Bachelor of Science in nutrition and dietetics*

08/02/24, 10:05 am - +263 77 808 7820: Ok thank you for the information however Mary is not interested in all the courses you have suggested she  is now opting nursing here in Zimbabwe
08/02/24, 10:43 am - Garima Edoofa: You mentioned that you would like to venture into the pharmacy industry. You will be glad to know that you can enter the pharmaceutical industry after completing a BSc in Chemistry. Here are few of the numerous ways to enter the pharmaceutical industry with a BSc in Chemistry:

1. Quality Control Technician: Quality control technicians play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and safety of pharmaceutical products. A BSc in Chemistry can qualify you for entry-level positions in quality control.

2. Research Assistant: Some pharmaceutical companies hire research assistants to support research and development efforts. While more advanced research roles may require a higher degree, a BSc in Chemistry can be a starting point.

3. Production Technician: Production technicians are involved in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. A background in chemistry can be beneficial for understanding the processes involved.

4. Laboratory Technician: Laboratories in pharmaceutical companies often require technicians to perform various tests and analyses. A BSc in Chemistry can provide the necessary skills for this role.
08/02/24, 10:43 am - Garima Edoofa: Moreover, BSc Chemistry and Bachelor in Pharmacy (BPharma) are closely related academic programs, both revolving around the study of chemicals and their applications. Here are some points for how BSc Chemistry can be closely related to BPharma and even offer some advantages:

1. Strong Foundation: Just like BPharma, BSc Chemistry offers a strong foundation in chemistry. You'll delve into the same core principles of chemistry, gaining a deep understanding of chemical compounds, reactions, and laboratory techniques.

2. Pharmaceutical Chemistry: BSc Chemistry includes courses in pharmaceutical chemistry, bridging the gap between the two programs. You'll learn about drug formulations, chemical processes involved in drug development, and quality control - all crucial aspects of the pharmaceutical industry.

3. Versatility: The advantage of BSc Chemistry lies in its versatility. While BPharma is specialized, BSc Chemistry opens doors to a broader array of career options. You can choose to work in pharmaceuticals, but you're also equipped to explore other industries such as petrochemicals, materials science, or environmental science.

4. Interdisciplinary Opportunities: BSc Chemistry allows you to combine your chemistry knowledge with other fields like biology or physics, fostering innovation. This interdisciplinary approach can lead to exciting career prospects at the intersection of various sciences.

5. Advanced Studies: Should you decide to specialize further, BSc Chemistry serves as a solid foundation for pursuing advanced studies in pharmaceutical chemistry or related fields, offering pathways to research and development roles in the pharmaceutical industry.

6. Problem-Solving Skills: BSc Chemistry hones your problem-solving skills, a quality highly valued in any profession, including pharmaceuticals.

With BSc Chemistry, you're not just limited to one career; you have the freedom to explore various industries, making you a dynamic candidate with diverse skills and knowledge. It's not just a degree; it's a platform for endless possibilities
08/02/24, 6:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
09/02/24, 9:06 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning, hope you all are doing well.

I would like to inform you, due to some urgent meeting we will commence the session at 10:30 AM CAT.
09/02/24, 8:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
