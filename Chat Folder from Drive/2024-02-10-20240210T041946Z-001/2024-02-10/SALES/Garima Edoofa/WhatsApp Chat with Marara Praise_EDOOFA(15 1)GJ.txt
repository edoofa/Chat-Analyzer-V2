23/01/24, 3:29 pm - +263 77 277 1544: yes
23/01/24, 3:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shall I brief you about the course?
23/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes
23/01/24, 3:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

06/02/24, 8:59 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263772771544 , Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
06/02/24, 5:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing back from you, but unfortunately, I didn't receive a response. Lately, our conversations have been a bit disrupted due to the timing not aligning with our available hours. I remain hopeful that we can have a smoother conversation tomorrow at 9:30 a.m, CAT. Your availability would be greatly appreciated; however, if you're unable to make it, please understand that, as an organization, we strive to be fair to all students. I may have to consider closing your application to ensure fairness in providing opportunities to other deserving students.
06/02/24, 6:40 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Good afternoon ma'am  
Like l pointed earlier  that l cannot be online at 9:30am because  lam a teacher l will be having lessons 
I will be free betw12:30 pm  and 1:00 pm because  that when l will be on lunch break
Then continue with lessons  upto 15:30pm
Please  don't  close  my application 🙏
07/02/24, 9:10 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand your concern, please.

But in that case, I would want you to complete the session today itself so that we can take your application to the interview round with the program director, as students are reserving their seats very quickly and therefore only a limited number of seats are left.
07/02/24, 9:43 am - +263 77 277 1544: Thank you so much for understanding  my concern
07/02/24, 10:20 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
07/02/24, 1:00 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Good afternoon  if possible we may start the session
07/02/24, 1:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
07/02/24, 1:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please answer this question?
07/02/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes I understand
07/02/24, 1:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
07/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 277 1544: We are not aware
07/02/24, 1:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you have a better understanding for the same.
07/02/24, 1:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/02/24, 2:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 2:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for you and your family?
07/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Uhmmm yaaa l think it's affordable  but a single parent  l have to work extra harder to raise  the fee but otherwise it's affordable
07/02/24, 2:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/02/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
07/02/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 277 1544: I promise  l wibe able to perform and clear all the criteria with a high passing grade
07/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 277 1544: And l will also be grateful if you consider my application
07/02/24, 3:31 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
07/02/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes you can
07/02/24, 3:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
07/02/24, 3:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/02/24, 3:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
07/02/24, 3:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

07/02/24, 3:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 3:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
07/02/24, 4:56 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Let me go through  what you have sent
07/02/24, 5:20 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes l like  the  Earn  program  it equips the child with the skills to workfor themselves so that they earn  and pay their fees
07/02/24, 5:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/02/24, 5:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/02/24, 5:45 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Thank you so much
Now l have realized  how useful is theEdoofa Earn program  
Itt lessens the burden especially to us single parents
07/02/24, 5:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
07/02/24, 5:52 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
07/02/24, 6:23 pm - +263 77 277 1544: I predicted point number 3 first
Secondly point number 2

Thirdly  point number 4

Lastly point  number  1
07/02/24, 6:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Mrs. Chihanja, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you as a family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education. <This message was edited>
07/02/24, 6:40 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes as a parent and mother l will  support  my  daughter for higher education
07/02/24, 6:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright @263772771544 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
07/02/24, 6:43 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes
07/02/24, 6:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263772771544 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/02/24, 6:46 pm - +263 77 277 1544: $1500 -$2250
07/02/24, 6:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
07/02/24, 6:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 6:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
07/02/24, 6:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
07/02/24, 6:49 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes l think so
07/02/24, 6:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/02/24, 6:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263772771544 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
07/02/24, 6:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/02/24, 6:52 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Ok
07/02/24, 6:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263772771544 , as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
07/02/24, 7:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
07/02/24, 7:12 pm - +263 77 277 1544: yess lam typing
07/02/24, 7:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, I am waiting for your respond, please.
07/02/24, 7:19 pm - +263 77 277 1544: I have learnt that the earn whikyou learn program is a unique program. It helps learners with online projects which helps them gain experience while having an opportunity to earn scholarship points.  these credits be used to pay their fees and make the university education affand less the burden to parents. This program also helps learners to develop skills whilst learning. The program also boast the need and facts of changing market. It also provides a holistic  environment for the students
07/02/24, 7:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
07/02/24, 7:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope now you are clear?
07/02/24, 7:20 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes
07/02/24, 7:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 7:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
07/02/24, 7:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
07/02/24, 7:25 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes
07/02/24, 7:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
07/02/24, 7:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 7:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
07/02/24, 7:30 pm - +263 77 277 1544: OK now my daughter in lower 6 this year
07/02/24, 7:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: As you have mentioned your daughter will be going to A-level this year, and hence preferred year of admission for Praise is 2025.
07/02/24, 7:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you have understood it now?

07/02/24, 7:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, understood.

I will talk to the academic board about the same, please.
07/02/24, 7:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
07/02/24, 7:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
07/02/24, 7:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 7:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: Do connect with Mrs. Ruth as a parent she will give you the insights about the program.
07/02/24, 7:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
07/02/24, 7:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
07/02/24, 7:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

08/02/24, 1:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Have you as a parent had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
08/02/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes l have connected with her
She just assured me that will be fine with Eddofa
She also mentioned that if it was no Edoofa she should not have make it with her daughters in terms of education

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
08/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes l really appreciated it

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!
08/02/24, 1:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 1:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: In the mean time can you please answer these questions.
08/02/24, 1:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

08/02/24, 1:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263772771544 I would like you to correct the course, please.
08/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Mechanical engineering _ artificial intelligence
08/02/24, 2:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are you as a parent ready for the same.
08/02/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 277 1544: Yes
08/02/24, 2:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
08/02/24, 2:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
08/02/24, 2:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th or 15th February 2024 for $200 and the 14th or 15th of March  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th or 15th February 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
