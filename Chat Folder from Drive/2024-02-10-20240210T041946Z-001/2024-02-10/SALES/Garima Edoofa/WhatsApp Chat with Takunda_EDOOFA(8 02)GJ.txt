08/02/24, 2:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Good Afternoon, I hope this finds you well,

I am Ms. Garima, Career Counselor at Edoofa.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Takunda

I hope I have contacted the right person?

08/02/24, 2:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as Ms. Garima and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
08/02/24, 6:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
09/02/24, 9:10 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning, hope you all are doing well.

I would like to inform you, due to some urgent meeting we will commence the session at 10:30 AM CAT.
09/02/24, 8:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.
