In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

MSW, also termed as Masters of Social Work is a 2 year undergraduate degree course that provides knowledge and skills to work in the social sector, aiming to provide quality life as well as education. Social Work, as the name suggests, aims to provide each and every citizen, specifically the less priviledged ones, a dignified life worth living with all aspects of social amenities and equal justice.

*What is MSW Course*
MSW is a three-year undergraduate professional degree course majoring in the field of social work. A typical MSW degree course lasts three years and is broken down into six semesters.  In certain circumstances, candidates are required to finish the program within a maximum of six years. Candidates can enroll in MSW full-time or even as a correspondence or distance learning degree. There are three main components to the MSW course: the foundation course, the elective course, and the fieldwork.

MSW courses can be pursued in various colleges in the country. It is useful to candidates who may like to work in social welfare sectors as it helps them acquire professional skills and knowledge to help the clients deal with their emotional and psychological problems. The curriculum provides social work education and training based on indigenous knowledge. It helps the learner to develop the required attitudes in understanding people’s problem-solving interventions.

*Why Study MSW*
MSW is apt for candidates interested in providing professional assistance to people in need. 

-MSW is specially meant for the ones who are aiming at improving the quality of life of the poorest of the poor and understand the growing demand for professionally trained social workers across the country.
-MSW helps the learner acquire professional skills and develop the capacity in helping people to solve various social and economic problems. 
-Having good observation and evaluation skills along with some prior knowledge of prevailing social issues helps in gaining excellence in the subject.

07/02/24, 10:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination?
07/02/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 129 7991: That is  true i am wondering  why?
07/02/24, 10:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

07/02/24, 11:08 am - +263 77 129 7991: I now understand  thank you
07/02/24, 11:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let us start by briefing you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
07/02/24, 11:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/02/24, 11:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/02/24, 11:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 11:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/02/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 129 7991: Thank you so much ..thank you ....
07/02/24, 11:21 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Harriett what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*But as some courses are niche in nature like *Master in social work* itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*.
07/02/24, 11:22 am - Keshav Edoofa: However as i mentioned you can reduce your remaining annual fee as much as you can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
07/02/24, 11:22 am - +263 77 129 7991: I'm  interested thank you
07/02/24, 11:23 am - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall i brief you about the EWYL program?
07/02/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 129 7991: I would like to reduce it through earn while i learn program
07/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 77 129 7991: Yes
07/02/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
07/02/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/02/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
07/02/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
_Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
07/02/24, 11:27 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

07/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 129 7991: So much thank you
07/02/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Harriett, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/02/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 129 7991: Thank you ..thank you ..I am  willing to work hard
07/02/24, 12:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/02/24, 12:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
07/02/24, 12:07 pm - +263 77 129 7991: That is exactly  what i was looking for.. thank you .I'm  interested
07/02/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 129 7991: I'm  motivated thank you.
07/02/24, 12:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could resonate with the benefits of the program
07/02/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 129 7991: Yes yes ...thank you
07/02/24, 12:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Harriett, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
07/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 77 129 7991: Yes  I  am ready
07/02/24, 12:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Harriett as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/02/24, 12:13 pm - +263 77 129 7991: $300 × 5 universities=$1500
$450×5 universities=2250 <This message was edited>
07/02/24, 12:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Harriett, and you see this is not affordable for people out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750. <This message was edited>
07/02/24, 12:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 12:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
07/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 129 7991: Thank.. you
07/02/24, 12:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We have taken this cost even lower to 350$ as we do understand the challenges but we are not compromising the opportunities for the students
07/02/24, 12:16 pm - +263 77 129 7991: Thank you
07/02/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 129 7991: How long  should this fee take before paid?
07/02/24, 12:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
07/02/24, 12:18 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall explain to you that in payment policy right after
07/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 129 7991: Thank you
07/02/24, 12:18 pm - +263 77 129 7991: Thank you
07/02/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 129 7991: I do think so ..
07/02/24, 12:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: But Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/02/24, 12:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
07/02/24, 12:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Harriett, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 129 7991: Thank you
07/02/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 129 7991: I really appreciate
07/02/24, 12:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Harriett from your response it seems that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
07/02/24, 12:23 pm - +263 77 129 7991: Yes yes true that

08/02/24, 8:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello Harriett @263771297991,  Good Morning, Hope you are doing well
I hope you have discussed all the points mentioned above regarding the program's aspects with your family

I am here to address any questions you have regarding the same!?
08/02/24, 9:10 am - +263 77 129 7991: How are you
08/02/24, 9:11 am - +263 77 129 7991: The first question ...after completion  of all the stages...does the $350 cater for the flight ticket
08/02/24, 9:20 am - +263 77 129 7991: Got an answer  from this thank you
08/02/24, 9:20 am - +263 77 129 7991: We can continue
08/02/24, 9:39 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall share all the financial aspects with you in a comprehensive manner again with you and all the assistance included in it!
08/02/24, 9:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 9:40 am - Keshav Edoofa: Referring to this image let me re-explain the financial aspect of the program in 3 parts.

1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc.

2. The Registration fee would be between $500-$1000, basically if you recall I did brief you after your university interaction with multiple universities, you would have to reserve your seat in 1 particular university you would have to pay a registration fee. Now usually Registration fee for a student is a separate expense altogether, however for an Edoofian it is considered a part of the first year's annual fee.

Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-25 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-26.

3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee However if a student is able to clear the Eligibility Check test and Interview with over 90 marks, a student is eligible to get a 90% to 100% scholarship where the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between $1250-$1500, which would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee
08/02/24, 9:45 am - +263 77 129 7991: Thank you ....
08/02/24, 9:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: Is there anything else you would like me to address?
08/02/24, 9:46 am - +263 77 129 7991: Have understood  now thank you ....
08/02/24, 9:47 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2022 and June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*

08/02/24, 9:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is great
08/02/24, 9:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now let me ask you a few questions
08/02/24, 9:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing his higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

08/02/24, 12:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
