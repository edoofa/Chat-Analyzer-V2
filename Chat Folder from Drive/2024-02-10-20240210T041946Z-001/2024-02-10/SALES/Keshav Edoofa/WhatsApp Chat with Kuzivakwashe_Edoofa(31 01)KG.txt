05/02/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 089 5474: We shall continue
05/02/24, 11:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: No worries , i shall brief you about Edoofa in depth!
05/02/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/02/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/02/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/02/24, 11:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/02/24, 11:26 am - +263 78 089 5474: Thank you
05/02/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 089 5474: So who are eligible for 100% scholarship
05/02/24, 11:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/02/24, 11:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Olk noted thankx
05/02/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Thats it sure
05/02/24, 2:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Kuzivakwashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
05/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Ohh olk 
So am Kuzivakwashe Nyevera a boy aged 20 . I did my O n A level studies at First Choice Pvt school. I wish to study social work .My mother is a teacher while my father is a carpenter and we live in Zimbabwe
05/02/24, 3:01 pm - +263 78 089 5474: I like to play foatball n volleyball and l like to be a lead
05/02/24, 3:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you for the introduction Kuzivakwashe
05/02/24, 3:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your tertiary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 089 5474: The reason why l applied for this scholarship is that financially we are not stable financially
05/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Yu are welcome
05/02/24, 3:16 pm - +263 78 089 5474: My parents can manage some expenses
05/02/24, 3:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know what is your term fee at First Choice Pvt school?
05/02/24, 3:18 pm - +263 78 089 5474: US$300 .00
05/02/24, 3:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Meanwhile as we proceed ahead, I had a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Social Work, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
05/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 78 089 5474: The living standards of a number of people who did social work motivates me
05/02/24, 3:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Kuzivakwashe, being in the education field the concern is that Social Work is a niche course and not many universities don't teach this course as the cost of education of this course from a university point of view is too high as they have to invest a lot of money as it is practical in nature and not theoretical.

Now usually what students do is they pursue a course which similar to social work as when we come to job market many people compete for the same position just because they have relevant knowledge of the same course that they studying, without pursuing a degree in social work 

Thus what students usually do is pursue course in Sociology in the first place because both the courses are similar in nature, that is why students who pursue Sociology have career opportunities that are present for social work already and further extra opportunities await.

So in that case shall I brief you about B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology?
05/02/24, 3:31 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Thank you so much for the information
05/02/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Ohh olk you can buh l have a passion in social work
05/02/24, 3:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see both fields are very closely related and you can get involved in social work through specialization courses, workshops, drives, etc while pursuing Sociology!
05/02/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Ohhh olk 
Do you have social work ?
05/02/24, 3:42 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Can l get more information about sociology
05/02/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As i explained, Kuzivakwashe a very few universities offer social work as a degree because of the reasons I cited and they do not offer any scholarships as well,
05/02/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure
05/02/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society.

07/02/24, 8:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello, Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
07/02/24, 9:43 am - +263 78 089 5474: Morning how are you
07/02/24, 9:43 am - +263 78 089 5474: Lets start
07/02/24, 11:00 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let us start by briefing you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
07/02/24, 11:00 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/02/24, 11:00 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/02/24, 11:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 11:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 089 5474: Understood
07/02/24, 11:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Kuzivakwashe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/02/24, 11:41 am - +263 77 273 2983: Great
07/02/24, 11:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Mr. Nyevera i hope you are following up on your child's session!
07/02/24, 11:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now shall I explain all about the EWYL program to both of you?
07/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 78 089 5474: Yes
07/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 78 089 5474: Ok noted
07/02/24, 11:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
07/02/24, 11:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs

-TIA Organics
07/02/24, 11:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
_Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
07/02/24, 11:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

07/02/24, 12:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Kuzivakwashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/02/24, 2:19 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Noted thankx
07/02/24, 2:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/02/24, 2:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
07/02/24, 2:36 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Thank you for the information
07/02/24, 2:36 pm - +263 78 089 5474: It is for sure
07/02/24, 2:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you can understand the benefits of our EWYL program and how it can make your education affordable
07/02/24, 2:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
07/02/24, 2:41 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Am ready
07/02/24, 2:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Kuzivakwashe as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/02/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Us 1500
07/02/24, 2:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Kuzivakwashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
07/02/24, 2:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 2:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
07/02/24, 2:52 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Olk noted
07/02/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
07/02/24, 2:56 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Am following
07/02/24, 2:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/02/24, 2:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
07/02/24, 2:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Kuzivakwashe, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/02/24, 3:03 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Olk noted
07/02/24, 3:04 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Ohh better then
07/02/24, 3:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am sure you are willing and waiting to be the part of this exciting program!
07/02/24, 3:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could understand what I intended to share with you so that I can help you and guide you to secure maximum scholarship for your education and you do wonders ahead!
07/02/24, 3:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we are into the last stage of your counseling
07/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Yes thats true
07/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Olk sir
07/02/24, 3:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
07/02/24, 3:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 3:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Kuzivakwashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
07/02/24, 3:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
07/02/24, 3:27 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Understood
07/02/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
07/02/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
07/02/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
07/02/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>

07/02/24, 3:35 pm - +263 78 089 5474: Ohh Olk thank you
07/02/24, 3:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, I want to ask if is there anything you would like me to address?

I hope Mr. Nyevera @263772732983 and Mrs. Zhira @263774727062 you are keeping a follow-up on your child's counseling session!?
Is there anything you would like me to clarify for you?
07/02/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 089 5474: So far so good
07/02/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program* <This message was edited>

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.
