31/01/24, 1:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
31/01/24, 1:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
31/01/24, 1:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
31/01/24, 1:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 1:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Wow, those are some pretty striking figures.It's really amazing to see just how much lower the cost of education is in India compared to other countries. And it's not just the cost of tuition that's lower - living expenses, food, and transportation are also much more affordable in India. So, I can definitely see why studying in India could be a great option for students who are looking for an affordable and high-quality education.
31/01/24, 1:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Tadiwa , you are correct with your understanding
31/01/24, 1:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Tadiwa what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
31/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 726 5643: That's really impressive! It's great to see that Anhad Edutrain Solutions is working so hard to make education more affordable and accessible for students. The Employability Aspect sounds like a really innovative and helpful program, and I'm sure the scholarships are making a big difference for families.
31/01/24, 1:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So would you like to ask anything or shall i brief you about the EWYL program to you?
31/01/24, 1:13 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Please, do tell me more about the EWYL.
31/01/24, 1:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
31/01/24, 1:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

31/01/24, 1:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
31/01/24, 1:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

31/01/24, 1:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?* <This message was edited>
31/01/24, 1:20 pm - +263 77 726 5643: I think the program is a fantastic idea! The fact that students are given real-world experience and an opportunity to develop job-ready skills while still in school is really unique. I think this program has the potential to give students a huge advantage when it comes to finding employment after graduation. They'll be able to apply for jobs with relevant skills and experience already under their belt. I think this is a really valuable opportunity for students like Shawn. I imagine it would be a huge confidence boost as well to know that they're building a set of skills that employers want.
31/01/24, 1:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Tadiwa, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
31/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 78 296 3912: Wonderful  Tadiwa.
31/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 78 296 3912: Thank you  much.
31/01/24, 1:25 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Oh, so it's a sliding scale, where the more credits a student earns, the more of their costs are covered. That's really brilliant. I love that it gives students control over how much they want to reduce their fees, and puts the power in their hands to make their education more affordable. This must be really motivating for them to know that their efforts can have a tangible impact on the cost of their education.

31/01/24, 1:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You are welcome Mr. Rudo

31/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Thank you
31/01/24, 1:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

31/01/24, 1:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
31/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 78 296 3912: Thank you much .This is much interesting.
31/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Yes, absolutely. I think this is a creative approach to higher education. It's not just about attending classes and completing assignments, it's about giving students the tools to be proactive about their education and earning opportunities. And of course, it's really wonderful that the program is focused on affordability and financial aid for students.  I'm really impressed by the whole philosophy behind Edoofa.
31/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 71 270 1555: Thank  you Tadiwa  you are amazing.
31/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 71 270 1555: Thank this is good.
31/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Thank you
31/01/24, 1:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Amazing Tadiwa , you have been amazing throughout the session till now!
31/01/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could all resonate with benefits of our program
31/01/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
31/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Thank you
31/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Yeah, it's so refreshing to hear about a program that's really focused on helping students succeed and achieve their goals.
31/01/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Yes l'm ready
31/01/24, 1:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Tadiwa as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
31/01/24, 1:59 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Wow, so a student can easily end up spending between $1500-$2250 just on applying to different universities! That's a huge financial barrier for someone who's trying to pursue their higher education. No wonder students can feel so overwhelmed by the application process. That's a lot of money to spend just to apply, without even being guaranteed a place at a university. It really puts the whole process out of reach for some students.
31/01/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Tadiwa, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
31/01/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
31/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 726 5643: So, for just $750, a student has the opportunity to access Edoofa's entire ecosystem of programs. That's a huge saving, compared to the potentially thousands of dollars
31/01/24, 2:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is even further reduced to 350$ tadiwa
31/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Thus awesome.
31/01/24, 2:06 pm - +263 77 726 5643: And affordable
31/01/24, 2:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
31/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Absolutely.This is really groundbreaking stuff. It's amazing to see how Edoofa is streamlining the entire application process for students, and even helping them get access to work opportunities and other benefits through the program. This could really make the difference for a lot of students who might not otherwise be able to pursue higher education, or who would struggle to make ends meet while studying abroad. I think this is going to be really impactful for a lot of people.
31/01/24, 2:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
31/01/24, 2:13 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Oky sure
31/01/24, 2:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Tadiwa, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
31/01/24, 2:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
31/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Okay l understand the phases of the enrollment process
31/01/24, 2:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well Tadiwa, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
31/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Yes l did understand
31/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 270 1555: Thank you much
31/01/24, 2:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
31/01/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Tadiwa, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
31/01/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
31/01/24, 2:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
31/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Yes l do have a in-depth understanding
31/01/24, 2:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
31/01/24, 2:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
31/01/24, 2:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 2:30 pm - +263 77 726 5643: That's so interesting. So, the Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) is like a guarantee that a student will be accepted to a university. This is a really valuable piece of documentation, and I'm curious to know - what kind of universities are a part of the Edoofa Program.
31/01/24, 2:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes that's right Tadiwa, for your clarification the best ranking private universities are part of the Eoofa program which help students in securing plethora of opportunities in their career
31/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 726 5643: Oky l understand
31/01/24, 2:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So is there anything you would like me to address?
31/01/24, 2:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263712701555 @263782963912 I hope you were following the session, is there anything you would like to ask?
31/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 77 726 5643: You've given me so much information about the Edoofa Program and its benefits, and I really appreciate all the time and effort you've put into explaining it to me.
31/01/24, 2:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
31/01/24, 2:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed toSo now would you like to ask anything?
 be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s.
