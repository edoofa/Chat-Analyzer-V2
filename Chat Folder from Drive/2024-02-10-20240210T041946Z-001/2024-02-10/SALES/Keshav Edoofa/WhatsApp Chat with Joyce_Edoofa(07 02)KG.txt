09/02/24, 4:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me further Elaborate about Edoofa Scholarship program to you
09/02/24, 4:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/02/24, 4:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/02/24, 4:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/02/24, 4:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
