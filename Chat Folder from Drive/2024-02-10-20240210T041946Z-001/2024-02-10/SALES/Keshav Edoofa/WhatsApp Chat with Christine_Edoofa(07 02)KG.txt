08/02/24, 11:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning Christine!

*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Tinotendaishe.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
08/02/24, 4:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263774957402 may i know even after seeing the message why are you not responding?
08/02/24, 5:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
08/02/24, 7:12 pm - +263 77 495 7402: Good evening
Sorry for the late response I was travelling today <This message was edited>

09/02/24, 9:05 am - Keshav Edoofa added +263 77 535 8899
09/02/24, 9:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello, Good Morning, Hope you are doing well
I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
09/02/24, 9:26 am - +263 77 495 7402: Good morning,
Yes we may start
09/02/24, 9:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Before i elaborate about Edoofa scholarship program to you i want to know about your understanding regarding the same as you learnt from Tinotendaishe.
09/02/24, 9:44 am - +263 77 495 7402: My understanding is that EDOOFA is a scholarship program that helps students to reduce their university payment and it offers many opportunities.This is done through the EWYL program.It is a well known program in the SADC nations and in Africa.
09/02/24, 9:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is wonderful Christine
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall briefly elaborate about Edoofa scholarship program to you!
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
09/02/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 495 7402: Thank you
09/02/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 495 7402: Understood
09/02/24, 10:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/02/24, 10:03 am - +263 77 495 7402: Yes Sir
09/02/24, 10:15 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Christine, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

09/02/24, 3:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is really great Christine, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
09/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 77 495 7402: Yes I'm willing to do so
09/02/24, 3:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
09/02/24, 3:47 pm - +263 77 495 7402: I am interested in studying abroad  because I will be able to  access the best programs and the best universities with the best facilities that suits  my program.It would also help me improve in language skills  and after graduation I could get the opportunity to explore my knowledge to reputable organisations across the globe . It will provide me with job opportunities and exposure. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe including food and accommodation. And today, the internet is a necessity and abroad it is more cheaper and readily available compared to my country.
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.
09/02/24, 3:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I duly understand what you are sharing and resonate with the same also i realize you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.
