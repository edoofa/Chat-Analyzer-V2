*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from Thrive.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!

Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

07/02/24, 9:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello, Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
07/02/24, 4:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
07/02/24, 5:21 pm - +263 71 837 4961: Yes

08/02/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is a pleasure to connect with you today,

You can address me as Mr. Keshav and we do have Mr. Piyush, Head of Counseling who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

Also do note that my working hours are *9:00 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*. Your active participation would be greatly appreciated.
08/02/24, 5:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
