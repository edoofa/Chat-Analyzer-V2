31/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 249 3025: What type of scholarship is this
31/01/24, 10:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: I will elaborate about the Edoofa scholarship program!
31/01/24, 10:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
31/01/24, 10:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
31/01/24, 10:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
31/01/24, 10:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/01/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 835 6584: okay so l heard you talking about 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation is this by any chance possible that everyone can get an offer like this
31/01/24, 10:26 am - +27 61 756 7602: Which programs do you mainly offer
31/01/24, 10:29 am - +27 61 756 7602: This is good keep up on the good work you're doing 🙏
31/01/24, 10:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Also it depends upon various factors like your overall profile, grades, parents support etc
31/01/24, 10:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you Mrs. Sarah , I am glad
31/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 835 6584: okay thank you

05/02/24, 11:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
05/02/24, 11:39 am - +263 77 835 6584: noted
05/02/24, 11:42 am - +27 61 756 7602: Good morning
05/02/24, 11:42 am - +27 61 756 7602: Noted
05/02/24, 11:50 am - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your tertiary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad?
05/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 835 6584: my father
05/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 835 6584: and you asked who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad does this mean you guys you’re not going to?
05/02/24, 2:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
05/02/24, 2:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We at Edoofa provide scholarship to students and not sponsorships
05/02/24, 2:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: see I will explain with to you with an example, Avg cost of education in India is 7-8000$ which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 25,000-30000$ , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 2-3000$ per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food!
05/02/24, 4:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT TIME* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

07/02/24, 10:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Simbarashe I would like to tell you that first, this is a counseling session for your child so that the child and the family get well-versed with our program aspects and the benefits it includes.

Responses and family members' active involvement is our one of the factors that we look upon in deciding the quantum of scholarship your child receives.

You should rather check on the activeness of your child and yourself throughout the session by looking at the messages above as you and Evylin have been very late and unresponsive and inconsistent with your replies

I strongly recommend patience while the counseling session is being continued and utmost seriousness as this is a life-changing opportunity for your child

I shall give you all the details if you are willing to attend the session patiently as we believe in imparting all the information in depth so that the student and the parent are not ill-informed regarding any aspects of the program

07/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 835 6584: oooh l liked number3 moreeee
07/02/24, 2:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Do go through them carefully
07/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 835 6584: noted sir
07/02/24, 2:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: If you have gone through them well,
07/02/24, 2:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let us start by briefing you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
07/02/24, 2:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/02/24, 2:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/02/24, 2:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 2:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/02/24, 2:51 pm - +263 77 835 6584: do you do semester’s if so how many semester’s do you do on a 1year
07/02/24, 2:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Evylin it is semester based and its twice a semester in an year
07/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 835 6584: per year sir?
07/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 835 6584: alright sir
07/02/24, 2:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Evylin what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/02/24, 4:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/02/24, 5:40 pm - +263 77 835 6584: I get it
07/02/24, 5:42 pm - +263 77 835 6584: l’m sorry for being offline my phone was on charger so this means lll have to send my certificates tomorrow

08/02/24, 10:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: So are you excited to know about the EWYL program?
08/02/24, 10:53 am - +263 77 835 6584: yes sir can you shed more light about it
08/02/24, 10:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
08/02/24, 10:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/02/24, 10:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
08/02/24, 10:53 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

08/02/24, 10:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
08/02/24, 10:57 am - +263 77 835 6584: noted sir
08/02/24, 10:58 am - +263 77 835 6584: may lve time to go through what you just send
08/02/24, 11:04 am - Keshav Edoofa: Sure Evylin
08/02/24, 11:18 am - +263 77 835 6584: I’m done sir and it’s loud and clear
08/02/24, 11:20 am - +263 77 835 6584: so how do l manage EWYL and my lectures won’t it give me pressure and is it allowed that l concentrate on lectures only
08/02/24, 11:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: See Evylin EWYL program is designed in such a way that it does not come in the way of a student's learning and lectures, the projects are given to students so that they do not cause any hindrance in their pursuing of their degree and along side it they can reduce their tuition fee as much as they can and learn practical skills
08/02/24, 11:27 am - +263 77 835 6584: oooh l get it sir
08/02/24, 11:28 am - +263 77 835 6584: so it’s an advantage to a student to participate in EWYL
08/02/24, 11:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/02/24, 11:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
08/02/24, 11:34 am - +263 77 835 6584: yes sir it’s amazing
08/02/24, 11:35 am - +263 77 835 6584: learning and earning
08/02/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Evylin, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 835 6584: following 
so there are tangible benefits
08/02/24, 11:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: Yes thats right Evylin!
08/02/24, 11:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
08/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 77 835 6584: yes sir
08/02/24, 11:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: Evylin as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 77 835 6584: noted letter of recommendation is from my school
08/02/24, 12:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I asked you a question based on the information i sent you Evylin, i request you to go through it carefully
08/02/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263778356584 I asked you to be proactive for the next 20 minutes as discontinuing the session in between like this will lead to a misunderstanding of the program!
08/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 835 6584: it’s alright sir
08/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 835 6584: I’m here
08/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 835 6584: network problems
08/02/24, 2:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its Alright Evylin in that case you may answer now!
08/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 835 6584: this is the question sir
08/02/24, 2:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall tell you what i was trying to convey,  considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending around 2200$, isnt it right Evylin?
08/02/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 835 6584: yes sir because at each theyll be expecting a certain amount comparing applying at one university
08/02/24, 2:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Evylin, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/02/24, 2:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 2:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/02/24, 2:14 pm - +263 77 835 6584: that’s true
08/02/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 835 6584: noted
08/02/24, 2:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/02/24, 2:30 pm - +263 77 835 6584: yes sir l think so
08/02/24, 2:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/02/24, 2:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
08/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 835 6584: following
08/02/24, 2:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Evylin, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 835 6584: following
08/02/24, 2:33 pm - +263 77 835 6584: so all in all it’s $350
08/02/24, 2:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Evylin that is right
08/02/24, 2:50 pm - +263 77 835 6584: okay noted
08/02/24, 2:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well Evylin, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
08/02/24, 3:00 pm - +263 77 835 6584: yes sir
08/02/24, 3:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
08/02/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Evylin, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
08/02/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/02/24, 4:00 pm - +263 77 835 6584: yes sir
08/02/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/02/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
08/02/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
08/02/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 4:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
08/02/24, 4:19 pm - +263 77 835 6584: following sir
08/02/24, 4:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, I want to ask if is there anything you would like me to address?

I hope Mr. Simbarashe and Mrs.Sarah @263772493025 @27617567602 you are keeping a follow-up on your child's counseling session!?
08/02/24, 4:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Is there anything you would also like to ask?
08/02/24, 4:22 pm - +263 77 249 3025: Am following your conversation
08/02/24, 4:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

08/02/24, 4:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is covered Evylin
08/02/24, 4:28 pm - +263 77 835 6584: okay sir
08/02/24, 4:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall share all the financial aspects with you in a comprehensive manner again with you and all the assistance included in it!
08/02/24, 4:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 4:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Referring to this image let me re-explain the financial aspect of the program in 3 parts.

1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc.

2. The Registration fee would be between $500-$1000, basically if you recall I did brief you after your university interaction with multiple universities, you would have to reserve your seat in 1 particular university you would have to pay a registration fee. Now usually Registration fee for a student is a separate expense altogether, however for an Edoofian it is considered a part of the first year's annual fee.

Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-25 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-26.

3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee However if a student is able to clear the Eligibility Check test and Interview with over 90 marks, a student is eligible to get a 90% to 100% scholarship where the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between $1250-$1500, which would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.
