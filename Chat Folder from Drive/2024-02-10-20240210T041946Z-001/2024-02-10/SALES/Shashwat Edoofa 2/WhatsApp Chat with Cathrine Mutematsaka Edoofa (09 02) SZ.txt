My hobby is playing netball. Both my parents have grade 7 certificates and both of them are peasant farmers. family background goes like this, we are three in the family. l am the second born in the family. My eldest brother is crippled. My little sis is not in school due to lack of adequate financial resources. My mother is asthmatic. My father was involved in an accident few years ,so it is hard for him to afford for everyone in the family because of his health condition which is not stable. I think that is all about myself
