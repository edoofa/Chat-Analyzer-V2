*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

08/02/24, 8:38 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*
