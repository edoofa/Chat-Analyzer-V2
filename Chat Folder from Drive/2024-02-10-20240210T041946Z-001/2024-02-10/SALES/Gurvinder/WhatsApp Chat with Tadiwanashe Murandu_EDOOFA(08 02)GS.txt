*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
08/02/24, 9:17 am - +263 77 131 9752: Greetings Mr Gurvinder
Pleasure to meet you
08/02/24, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Tadiwanashe,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
08/02/24, 8:38 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
09/02/24, 8:12 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
09/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 131 9752: Hello Mr Gurvinder
09/02/24, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
09/02/24, 2:13 pm - +263 77 131 9752: I once carried out this kind of sessions last year with Mr Shashwat and the director. I reached the stage where I had to pay the $350 to secure my scholarship sit and since I failed to raise the money It was terminated. Does this mean I have to start all over again.
09/02/24, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, have you managed to raised the enrollment fee?
09/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 77 131 9752: I was told my application was terminated so I didn't raise the fee
09/02/24, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: So are your parents ready to raise the enrollment fees?
09/02/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 131 9752: Not yet
09/02/24, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: So do you want to go through the counselling session again?
09/02/24, 2:34 pm - +263 77 131 9752: And Sir in the event that I fail to raise the fee again will my application be terminated again? Because as of now the home situation is tough and I have no guarantee that I will be able to pay the fee on time.
09/02/24, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: Please, that is correct.
09/02/24, 2:41 pm - +263 77 131 9752: And again I will have to rely on my self to raise the money because my parents are no longer interested
09/02/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Please, I cannot move ahead with your application if your parents are not interested.
