I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

24/01/24, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, what is the issue?

24/01/24, 1:20 pm - +260 97 7712206: I thought that is why I'm available for you to orient me now
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you.
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
24/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
24/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/01/24, 1:52 pm - +260 97 7712206: Wow.. So interesting!
24/01/24, 1:53 pm - +260 97 7712206: What is my role in this case? I mean how would I apply for sponsorship because I am interested
24/01/24, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Muke, as we start Kelvin's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/01/24, 2:24 pm - +260 97 7712206: So who should be counseled, me as the parent or Keke as the candidate
24/01/24, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: Please you can participate instead of Keke, but if you are busy, I would encourage you to add Keke in the group.
24/01/24, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7712206: I better participate with her
24/01/24, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7712206: Please add her
24/01/24, 2:43 pm - +260 97 7712206: +260773798682
24/01/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Please add her to the group yourself.
24/01/24, 2:46 pm - ~ MUKE KELVIN added +260 773798682
24/01/24, 10:29 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
24/01/24, 11:04 pm - +260 97 7712206: Noted with thanks

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
25/01/24, 2:35 pm - +260 773798682: Noted
25/01/24, 3:07 pm - +260 773798682: My name is Keke Muke. I was born on the 1st of July 2006 in Zambia choma district
I want to be a pilot. I have always loved traveling growing up. Even if I have never had I chance to do so being a pilot is just something that contributed to the love I have for traveling.
I just finished finished my high school last year 2023 at njase girls secondary school located in southern province choma district where we paid k2155 per term
Both my parents are teachers but my mother has not yet been employed. They are the ones who have supposed me through out with my school fees.both my parents have gone to college obtain their degrees and my father obtained his masters in education 
Even as I go abroad I am certain that my parents will continue supporting me
I have four siblings two young brothers, one elder sister at University and one elder brother who's looking for a job
25/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Keke.
25/01/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to be a pilot, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
25/01/24, 3:15 pm - +260 773798682: What motivated me is a certain young lady who became a pilot at a  19. At first I used to get advice like it's risky, it's hard but I have never really taken that if someone out there managed to do it why should I fail
25/01/24, 3:22 pm - +260 773798682: Not forgetting the love I have for flying even if I have never been in a plane before and my biggest dream to travel to different places. I feel confident about myself that I can and will manage
25/01/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: That is a great motivation Keke, As much as I'd love to offer a pilot aviation course through the Edoofa program, it's important to note that the availability of courses under a scholarship program like Edoofa can be influenced by various factors.

Aviation courses, especially pilot training, come with exceptionally high costs($40000-80000) due to the specialised training, equipment, and flight hours required. Often, scholarship programs like Edoofa focus on more traditional academic courses due to their broader applicability and feasibility within their budgetary constraints.

The expenses associated with aviation courses, particularly pilot training, can surpass the scholarship resources. Additionally, these courses might have specific requirements or certifications that extend beyond the scope of what the scholarship program can offer.

However, if you would like to go ahead with the counselling session, I would love to offer you an Academic course.
25/01/24, 3:32 pm - +260 773798682: Thank you sir I would love to continue with the session

25/01/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
25/01/24, 4:20 pm - +260 773798682: Yes
25/01/24, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics* is a 3- year long full- time undergraduate course divided over 6 semesters. It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food.
B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.

The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.

Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.

Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.

Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.

Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.
25/01/24, 4:24 pm - +260 773798682: It's just okay sir I can manage

25/01/24, 4:27 pm - +260 773798682: Yes I understood
25/01/24, 4:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
25/01/24, 4:33 pm - +260 773798682: If I am provided with this career option five years from now I see myself working for institutions like the UN which will also help me with achieving my dreams for traveling and also through the money I will be making I am positive that I can definitely go for piloting and also by working really hard and sacrificing where it's needed to achieve what I want <This message was edited>

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
29/01/24, 12:24 pm - +260 773798682: Yes I am willing to give my 200%hard work and take all the opportunities that come in my way
29/01/24, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/01/24, 1:04 pm - +260 773798682: Studying in India would be an amazing opportunity to immerse myself in a different culture, learn from top-notch professors, and gain a global perspective on my field of study. Plus, India has a rich history, vibrant traditions,  I'd love to explore! It's all about embracing new experiences and broadening our horizons.
29/01/24, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
29/01/24, 1:08 pm - +260 773798682: If I were given the opportunity to study abroad on a scholarship, I would definitely want to bring back all the knowledge and experiences I gained to contribute to the development of the education system in my country.

By implementing these new approaches, I believe we can improve the quality of education and provide better opportunities for students in my country. It's all about making a positive impact and creating a brighter future for everyone.

29/01/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Keke, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
29/01/24, 1:38 pm - +260 773798682: I understand what you saying having a supportive environment  super important for studying effectively. I believe that studying abroad can provide me with those opportunities and help me gain the knowledge and skills needed to make a positive impact back home.

29/01/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?

29/01/24, 1:53 pm - +260 97 7712206: Interesting!
29/01/24, 1:59 pm - +260 773798682: I love that India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, it really pushes the boundaries of learning. Having skilled faculty members with real-world expertise is such a valuable asset. And the fact that Indian degrees are recognized worldwide is a big advantage for future career opportunities. The cultural diversity and vibrant campus life in India must make the whole experience even more amazing. It's great to know that education in India is affordable and there are scholarships available to support students. The fact that most courses are taught in English is definitely a plus for international students. And the opportunities for research and innovation in Indian,thinking and creativity. It sounds like studying in India offers so many incredible opportunities.
29/01/24, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: So now Keke, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
29/01/24, 2:15 pm - +260 773798682: Yes I have understood and I have no questions as for now
29/01/24, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
29/01/24, 2:17 pm - +260 773798682: I am not familiar with the expenses
29/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/01/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/01/24, 2:23 pm - +260 97 7712206: May I ask a question on behalf of Keke? Quiet well she might have her own career choice, but considering the programs  of study available for sponsorship,  what study program would you recommend for her?
29/01/24, 2:27 pm - +260 773798682: Alright
29/01/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Please, all the courses mentioned, that she is eligible for are all well pursued and well recognised all over India.
29/01/24, 2:42 pm - +260 97 7712206: This message was deleted
29/01/24, 2:43 pm - +260 97 7712206: Honestly, the $3000 per year is far from being afforded by most Zambian parents especially those in civil service. $ 3000 dollars is equivalent to ZMW 81 000, How an annual salary for most of us in civil service is about ZMW 84000. Many of us have Loans running on the payslip reducing that to annual salary almost by half. How possible can  one afford to sponsor one child at about ZMW 81000 per year when they're other Children who need help and the daily life surviving demands still depend on the little salary. What I mean is that children of Zambian teachers need 100% bursary if they are to pursue better courses because practically speaking it's impossible for a Zambian teacher to sponsor a child for higher education in best courses worse abroad
29/01/24, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Please to help parents in such situation, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
29/01/24, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Shall I brief you about that?
29/01/24, 2:50 pm - +260 97 7712206: This can be proven by a look at payslips of most of us parents  desiring to have our children study abroad. Yes, a parent may be working( just by name), but what we get mostly is  not even enough for hand to month. It's therefore my humble request that you consider my child for 100 % bursary to assist us meet the manageable expenses for my child
29/01/24, 2:51 pm - +260 97 7712206: Alright will appreciate
29/01/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Muke, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/01/24, 11:57 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
29/01/24, 11:59 pm - +260 773798682: Noted
30/01/24, 12:17 am - +260 773798682: I have a question about sponsorships are they hundred percent or not
30/01/24, 7:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/01/24, 10:29 am - +260 773798682: Noted
30/01/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Please refer to this.
30/01/24, 11:30 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
30/01/24, 11:31 pm - +260 773798682: I am sorry sir I thought that question was going to my father
31/01/24, 6:31 pm - +260 97 7712206: Perfectly yes, but the challenge I personally have is that I'm failing to get the context of the counselling questions. I therefore  humbly if the questions are clearly to me.
01/02/24, 7:55 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/02/24, 8:36 am - +260 773798682: Alright sir
01/02/24, 9:02 am - Gurvinder: Is @260977712206 available for the session?
01/02/24, 9:04 am - +260 773798682: No he's not yet here
01/02/24, 9:10 am - Gurvinder: So should I continue telling you more about the EWYL program?
01/02/24, 9:11 am - +260 773798682: Yes continue
01/02/24, 9:17 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
01/02/24, 9:17 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
01/02/24, 9:17 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

01/02/24, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
01/02/24, 9:23 am - +260 773798682: What you mean is that we get to work experience before university is done
01/02/24, 9:25 am - +260 773798682: Looking at every I think it's really great and I am looking forward to.
Yes I know it will benefit me
01/02/24, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Keke, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
01/02/24, 9:38 am - +260 773798682: Meaning that I can use the money I am getting from working can be used to pay for my other expenses?
01/02/24, 9:39 am - +260 773798682: If it's like that it's really great and I am willing to work extra hard for both my school and work
01/02/24, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: Please the scholarship credits earned can only be used to pay off the tuition fees.
01/02/24, 9:46 am - +260 773798682: Alright
01/02/24, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/02/24, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
01/02/24, 9:51 am - +260 773798682: This is really great and interesting I now understand
Looking forward to this as well
01/02/24, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: Alright Keke, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
01/02/24, 10:00 am - +260 773798682: Yes they will provide guidance, encouragement, and maybe even financial assistance if needed. It's important to appreciate and lean on those who support us on our educational journey.
01/02/24, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
01/02/24, 10:06 am - +260 773798682: Not yet but looking forward to
01/02/24, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
01/02/24, 10:08 am - +260 773798682: Sure
01/02/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: Keke as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/02/24, 10:11 am - +260 773798682: $2250
01/02/24, 10:13 am - +260 773798682: I have used $450 to calculate
01/02/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Keke, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/02/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 10:14 am - +260 773798682: Alright that's really good
01/02/24, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
01/02/24, 10:18 am - +260 773798682: Yes you are right
01/02/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/02/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
01/02/24, 10:23 am - +260 773798682: Understood sir Soo for our grade 12 results as for now they are out
01/02/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
01/02/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
01/02/24, 10:31 am - +260 773798682: Yes
01/02/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
01/02/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Alright @260773798682 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
01/02/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
01/02/24, 10:34 am - +260 773798682: Yes I have understood thank you
01/02/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
01/02/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
01/02/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
01/02/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
01/02/24, 10:41 am - +260 773798682: The $350 is the same money been talked about here
01/02/24, 10:42 am - +260 773798682: Otherwise I have understood and I am looking forward to get accepted

*“Go into the world and do well. But more importantly, go into the world and do good.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
02/02/24, 9:59 am - +260 773798682: Alright thanks
02/02/24, 10:02 am - +260 97 7712206: Sure!
02/02/24, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
02/02/24, 10:34 am - +260 773798682: Yes
02/02/24, 10:37 am - +260 97 7712206: Please go ahead
02/02/24, 11:05 am - Gurvinder: @260977712206 Please I hope you have been following the session so far.

So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
02/02/24, 11:08 am - +260 773798682: As for now no we can continue
02/02/24, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: Please ask @260977712206 to address the same?
02/02/24, 11:37 am - +260 97 7712206: Yes. 1.When are they likely to go after payments?                                2. Who foots the air ticket bills?
02/02/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Please after you enroll with the Edoofa Scholarship program, the admissions team will contact your for the smooth operation of your child's admission, and talking about the cost of travelling to India, that is a one time cost that you have to bear, but I assure you that our VISA experts will be there to guide you through the whole process.
02/02/24, 12:53 pm - +260 97 7712206: This message was deleted
02/02/24, 12:53 pm - +260 97 7712206: Noted, but my worry is that after paying for enrollment and then your team starts giving us other bills that are not planned for. And so when we fail to pay/meet such bills (demands), you will exclude our child and lose out on what we would have spent already. I would therefore seek to know, any other bills/demands well in advance to help us decide rationally.
02/02/24, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Please, as told you earlier about the cost of education in India, everything after the enrollment fee will be part of the cost of education only, nothing else be charged to you, please do not worry about that.
02/02/24, 1:12 pm - +260 97 7712206: Noted.. Thanks
02/02/24, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
02/02/24, 1:30 pm - +260 97 7712206: I would say yes because my daughter briefed me. She said it's about $350, once pay off. Am I right? Please guide.
02/02/24, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct, and I hope you are available of the cost of education per year, and how it can be reduced through the EWYL program?
02/02/24, 3:02 pm - +260 773798682: Yes sir be is aware
02/02/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: Please ask @260977712206 to address the same as this session is for the parents.
02/02/24, 3:05 pm - +260 97 7712206: What do you mean by education cost per year? Does it mean I have to be paying some money yearly during her training? If yes, how much will I be paying every year?
02/02/24, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Please, didn't I brief you about this?
02/02/24, 3:32 pm - +260 97 7712206: I'm sure I answered this, that as a parent I may not be able to pay the yearly demanded fees. My financial capacity is Enadguate. Nonetheless, if your institution through your Learn and Earn program ensures that  she will be able to meet the yearly  fees, it's fine we as parents can pay the$ 350
02/02/24, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Please, that will purely depend on the student's hard work as you can see here.
02/02/24, 3:46 pm - +260 97 7712206: Meaning it's not guaranteed?
02/02/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the more the student puts in the hard work, the more he can earn the scholarship credits, but if he does not do any work, how can we provide scholarship credits to them, so that is why, the amount of scholarship credits that a student can earn, will purely depend on how much hard work will he put in the EWYL program.
02/02/24, 3:50 pm - +260 97 7712206: Noted, Sir, thanks
02/02/24, 3:51 pm - +260 97 7712206: What next is required of us as parents as at now
02/02/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: So @260977712206 , before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @260773798682 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
02/02/24, 4:56 pm - +260 97 7712206: This message was deleted
02/02/24, 4:58 pm - +260 97 7712206: 1.Bachelor of Science in nutrition and dietetics
2. India
3.$6000-$ 8000 per year          4. 2000                                   5. $350 payable before or by 29/02/2024                      6. Under Edoofa students not only learn the skills but also earn for learning. The earning here is defined in terms of recommendations, scholarship credits, industrial exposure, an experience that prepares them for life after college and skills to excel during that period.  With Earn While You Learn a student starts earning on the first day and by the time they finish the degree, they would not only gain theoretical but also practical knowledge. Edoofa holds a belief that higher education should not only be affordable but also be outcome-driven, opening doors for more professional  opportunities.  The Earn While You Learn also enables students to generate income through wages from I dustrial attachments and part time jobs. This provides students with finances to meet part of their school fees and other demands attached to the training.
