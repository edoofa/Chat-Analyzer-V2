I have already added Naomi in the group,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
06/02/24, 9:01 am - +260 97 7760225: Well noted Mr Gurvinder
06/02/24, 9:11 am - +260 772220291: The Edoofa scholarship program is a scholarship and not a sponsorship program it offers various scholarships based on academic performance,financial need and other criteria,it helps in enabling students to access quality education opportunities by paying 50 percent in the studies a student would want to partake in
06/02/24, 9:12 am - +260 772220291: This is the understanding I have for the program Mr Gurvinder
06/02/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
06/02/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
06/02/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
06/02/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
06/02/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
06/02/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/02/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
06/02/24, 10:43 am - +260 772220291: Yes of course
06/02/24, 10:45 am - +260 772220291: Does the program carter for up keep as well as accomodation
06/02/24, 10:59 am - Gurvinder: Please, you will be informed about everything, let me continue the counselling session.
06/02/24, 11:00 am - +260 772220291: What are the terms and conditions stipulated to this condition.What do you expect from the applicants
06/02/24, 11:00 am - +260 772220291: Ok
06/02/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Naomi, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
06/02/24, 12:04 pm - +260 772220291: I am confident that I have what it takes
06/02/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, Naomi.

07/02/24, 12:02 pm - +260 772220291: With all the information provided am clear, thank you, I appreciate the time you took to inform me sir
07/02/24, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
07/02/24, 12:06 pm - +260 772220291: Yes we are that is why we enrolled in this program
07/02/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
07/02/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/02/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/02/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
07/02/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like **BTech Biomedical Engineering** itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/02/24, 12:59 pm - +260 772220291: Thank u for the explanation
07/02/24, 1:06 pm - +260 97 7760225: Greetings to you Sir.
So elated with the insight given so far concerning the scholarship under discussion.
07/02/24, 1:09 pm - +260 97 7760225: As for the costs involved, as family we had no detailed information over the same but with your explanation given, it is indeed a great eye opener because we haven't been in touch with any international student who has studied in India to gather any background information.
07/02/24, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
07/02/24, 1:23 pm - +260 97 7760225: Kindly go ahead Sir.
07/02/24, 1:24 pm - Gurvinder: Naomi, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
07/02/24, 2:22 pm - +260 772220291: Ok
07/02/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/02/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
07/02/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

07/02/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
07/02/24, 3:03 pm - +260 772220291: The emphasis on turning any situation into an opportunity to excel is particularly impactful, as it instills a mindset of proactive problem-solving and continuous improvement. This mindset not only enhances employability but also fosters a culture of innovation and leadership among Edoofians.
Personally, I believe that participating in these webinars and embracing the principles they promote would greatly benefit me. They would not only enhance my employability but also equip me with the mindset and skills necessary to thrive in any field or situation, ultimately contributing to my personal and professional success.
07/02/24, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Naomi, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/02/24, 3:14 pm - +260 772220291: This learn while you earn program will really be an advantage to both I as a student and my family looking at what it offers
07/02/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/02/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
07/02/24, 3:28 pm - +260 772220291: I have gone through the certificates awarded to various students based on how they performed in the earn while you earn program and i do have realised and it is indeed a good program
07/02/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Naomi, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
07/02/24, 3:43 pm - +260 772220291: Ok
07/02/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
07/02/24, 3:51 pm - +260 772220291: We have and I was informed to first find out more about the program before deciding to study abroad and then the final decision will be made
07/02/24, 5:34 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
07/02/24, 5:38 pm - +260 772220291: Sure thing
07/02/24, 7:26 pm - +260 772220291: So how does it make it affordable for students and how much is it
07/02/24, 10:18 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 11AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
07/02/24, 10:22 pm - +260 95 5443455: Thank you God bless

08/02/24, 10:23 am - +260 772220291: Yes
08/02/24, 10:54 am - Gurvinder: Naomi as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/02/24, 8:33 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
09/02/24, 8:04 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
