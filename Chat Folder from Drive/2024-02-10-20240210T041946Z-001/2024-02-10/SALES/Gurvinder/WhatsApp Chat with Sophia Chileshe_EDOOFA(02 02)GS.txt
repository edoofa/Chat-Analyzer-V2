We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
02/02/24, 12:37 pm - +260 765723119: Yes you have contacted the right person

03/02/24, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.

05/02/24, 8:15 am - Gurvinder: Good morning! Drawing inspiration from biblical wisdom: 

*"In the sacred texts, we find that knowledge is a faithful companion, elevating one to respect beyond borders. Education outshines both beauty and youth."*

Let's fuel our positive energy and continue our interactive session.
05/02/24, 10:26 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
06/02/24, 9:11 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Sophia,
I hope you doing great, please!
I would like you to come online and complete the counselling session today itself as you have been very inconsistent in these sessions.
06/02/24, 11:09 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

*Education is the key to unlocking the golden door of freedom and opportunity. By investing in your child's education, you are investing in yourself, and with knowledge as your foundation, you have the power to shape a future of limitless possibilities.

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
08/02/24, 10:05 am - +260 765723119: Thank you go ahead
08/02/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Sophia, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from TEHILA, is that correct?
08/02/24, 10:38 am - +260 765723119: Yes
08/02/24, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from TEHILA, also do tell me whether you learnt about TEHILA’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/02/24, 11:25 am - +260 765723119: She introduced me to the scholarship program
08/02/24, 11:26 am - +260 765723119: No I wasn’t told about Tehilas journey or experience
08/02/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
08/02/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/02/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/02/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
08/02/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
08/02/24, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/02/24, 11:31 am - +260 765723119: So does every student at the school have the opportunity to access the earn as you learn program
08/02/24, 11:32 am - +260 765723119: Yes I do
08/02/24, 11:37 am - +260 765723119: I applied for accounts under business administration then after going through my results and research I decided I would do better in engineering so would I have any chances of changing that and if possible can I ?? <This message was edited>
08/02/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
08/02/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Please, it is, but first let us continue the counselling session.
08/02/24, 12:09 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
08/02/24, 12:12 pm - +260 765723119: Yes i do
08/02/24, 12:12 pm - +260 765723119: Alright
08/02/24, 12:12 pm - +260 765723119: Alright
08/02/24, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Sophia, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/02/24, 12:33 pm - +260 765723119: Yes for sure i have what it takes and will do my best to get a high quantum scholarship
08/02/24, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Now Judith, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

08/02/24, 12:57 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
08/02/24, 2:10 pm - +260 765723119: Zambia as a country lucks development and this inspired me to pick engineering  this way I can help in developing the country and its technology

08/02/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, in which field of engineering are you interested?
08/02/24, 3:11 pm - +260 765723119: Civil Engineering
08/02/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why didn't you take pure physics and pure chemistry if you wanted to do Civil Engineering?
08/02/24, 3:21 pm - +260 765723119: My school didn’t offer pure subjects because it lucked teachers for pures at the moment
08/02/24, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Sophia, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their Grade 12 which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their Grade 12 mandatorily.
08/02/24, 3:39 pm - +260 765723119: As my counselor what would you advise me to go for
08/02/24, 3:41 pm - +260 765723119: But here physics and chemistry are combined and considered as science but am good in math
08/02/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Please you can pursue computer science, as that will be a huge benefit for you as that is the future of your generation.
08/02/24, 3:43 pm - +260 765723119: So does your school offer computer science
08/02/24, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
08/02/24, 3:45 pm - +260 765723119: What courses are in computer science ????
08/02/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: Please I can offer you *Bachelor of Computer Application*.
08/02/24, 3:48 pm - +260 765723119: Alright thanks for your honesty opinion
08/02/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
08/02/24, 3:50 pm - +260 765723119: Yes please do so
08/02/24, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Computer Application* course graduates have a variety of career options after completion of the course.

08/02/24, 4:24 pm - +260 765723119: According to what I have learnt , I have found out that computer application is all about the up coming generation . And our generation is mostly forced on upcoming technology , this way I would help in developing both our upcoming generation and the country .
The courses that are offered in computer application like software developers a,data analysis and developing apps .  I am confident that this will surely develop the nation in or way or the other 
And like you advised me the subjects that I took in school will surely help me in this course .
Employment,industries ,computer and information systems will grow in response to the increasing demand for computer software .
It being a three years course it will be manageable for me .
08/02/24, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Sophia I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
08/02/24, 4:25 pm - +260 765723119: I am willing to do so
08/02/24, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/02/24, 4:28 pm - +260 765723119: My country is under developed that is why I am willing to learn from developed countries
08/02/24, 4:30 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
08/02/24, 8:48 pm - +260 765723119: I will aquire expertise, technology and experience of that developed county, this will enable me to impart the acquired knowledge to others. Practically and theoretically.
09/02/24, 8:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
09/02/24, 10:34 am - +260 765723119: Good morning 
May we go ahead
09/02/24, 11:39 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Sophia, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
09/02/24, 11:47 am - +260 765723119: Yes I do
09/02/24, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
09/02/24, 6:32 pm - +260 765723119: Yes
