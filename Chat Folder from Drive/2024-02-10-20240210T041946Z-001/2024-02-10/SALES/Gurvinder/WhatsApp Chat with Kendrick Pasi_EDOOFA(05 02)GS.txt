05/02/24, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Kendrick, Mr and Mrs Pas!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
06/02/24, 9:19 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Kendrick, Mr and Mrs Pas!
I would like you to come online and participate in the counselling session to help me lead Kendrick to a better higher education with plenty of opportunities to succeed in life.
06/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 246 5978: Good morning Sir. I am currently at work right now. Can we talk later?
06/02/24, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Is @263783868372 available for the session?
06/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 386 8372: Yes
06/02/24, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Kendrick,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
06/02/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 386 8372: Ok Mr Gurvinder
06/02/24, 1:33 pm - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
06/02/24, 2:17 pm - +263 78 386 8372: I have little knowledge about the program
06/02/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Please share that.
06/02/24, 2:24 pm - +263 78 386 8372: I only know that you offer 50-100 % scholarships
06/02/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
06/02/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
06/02/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
06/02/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
06/02/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
06/02/24, 3:14 pm - +263 78 386 8372: Yes indeed
06/02/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Kendrick, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
06/02/24, 11:12 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
07/02/24, 8:27 am - Gurvinder: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education

07/02/24, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: Please answer the 8th question properly.
07/02/24, 10:28 am - +263 78 386 8372: I studied my A level at Cherutombo High which is located in Mashonaland East and it cost $110 per term
07/02/24, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you, Kendrick.
07/02/24, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study data analysis, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
07/02/24, 12:05 pm - +263 78 386 8372: According to my research 
Data has become a crucial part in human evolution and it is highly anticipated that data analytics is set to grow as a career. 
As for me l am an individual who is interested in technology with a great desire of working with data

07/02/24, 10:22 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 11AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Embrace the journey of learning, for it is the transformative force that propels you towards greatness and opens doors to a world of endless opportunities.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
08/02/24, 8:34 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
09/02/24, 8:06 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Kendrick, 
I hope you are doing well, please!
I would like you to come online and complete the counselling session today itself, or I would have to put your application on hold as you have been very inconsistent with your presence.
09/02/24, 9:44 am - +263 78 386 8372: I have 9 O levels
Maths(A)
English (B)
Computer science (B)
Physics (B)
History (B)
Geography (C)
Biology (C)
Chemistry (C)
Agriculture (C)
09/02/24, 9:45 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why have you been so inactive?
09/02/24, 9:47 am - +263 78 386 8372: I had sent a pdf of my results and l didn't think you wanted me to just text you my results
09/02/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
09/02/24, 9:51 am - +263 78 386 8372: There are my O level results
09/02/24, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: May I know, are you planning to give your Physics A-level exam again?
09/02/24, 9:56 am - +263 78 386 8372: No depending on the degrees l want, physics is not a must
09/02/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: Please, that is not the case, as data analysis aligns well with the growing importance of data in various fields and technology which requires the person to acquire skills such as programming and learn about machine learning, I would suggest you to appear for the Physics A-level again or it would hinder my choice to just computer science and not a specialization of data analysis with it.
09/02/24, 5:20 pm - +263 78 386 8372: How about IT
09/02/24, 6:30 pm - +263 78 386 8372: I think l might consider retaking my physics if thats what's required
