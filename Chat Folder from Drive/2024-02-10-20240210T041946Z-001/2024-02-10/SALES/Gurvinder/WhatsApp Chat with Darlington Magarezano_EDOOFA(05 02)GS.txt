07/02/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Thelma who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
07/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 656 1426: She did not but I was about to ask her
07/02/24, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder changed the group name from "Darlington Magarezano_EDOOFA(05/02)GS IE" to "Darlington Magarezano_EDOOFA(05/02)GS"
07/02/24, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Darlington, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
07/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Yes I have sir
07/02/24, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: Now Darlington, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

07/02/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Darlington, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
07/02/24, 2:16 pm - +263 71 656 1426: I understand sir...so does it mean it's over me
07/02/24, 2:17 pm - +263 71 656 1426: So are there any programmes that I can pursue?...I really need your help sir
07/02/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Studying Geography as part of a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree can offer several benefits for someone interested in pursuing a career in mining engineering:

Understanding of Earth Systems: Geography provides a comprehensive understanding of Earth's physical processes, including landforms, natural resources, and environmental systems. This knowledge is directly relevant to mining engineering, as it helps engineers understand the geological formations and landscapes where mining operations take place.

Geological Context: Geography coursework often includes topics such as geomorphology, geology, and natural resource management. This background knowledge is valuable for mining engineers, as it helps them interpret geological data, assess potential mining sites, and understand the geological risks associated with mining activities.

Spatial Analysis Skills: Geography emphasizes spatial analysis techniques, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing. These tools are increasingly used in the mining industry for mapping, exploration, and environmental monitoring. By studying Geography, students develop skills in spatial data analysis that are highly relevant to mining engineering.

Environmental Considerations: Mining engineering involves managing environmental impacts associated with mining operations. Geography coursework often explores environmental issues, sustainability, and land use planning, providing students with a broader understanding of the environmental challenges and regulations facing the mining industry.

Interdisciplinary Perspective: Geography is an interdisciplinary field that integrates knowledge from natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. This interdisciplinary perspective is valuable for mining engineers, as it helps them understand the broader societal, economic, and environmental contexts in which mining activities occur.

Overall, studying Geography can complement a future career in mining engineering by providing students with a strong foundation in earth sciences, spatial analysis skills, and an interdisciplinary understanding of the environmental and social dimensions of mining operations.

08/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you for sharing this👏🏾
08/02/24, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: So now Darlington, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
08/02/24, 2:47 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Yes...Did you find me suitable to be offered a scholarship?
08/02/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Please that will be done after the counselling session?
08/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 71 656 1426: It's okay sir
08/02/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
08/02/24, 3:35 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Due to my research it sums up to $1 500 United States Dollars
08/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
08/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/02/24, 4:31 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Thank you sir
08/02/24, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
08/02/24, 5:09 pm - +263 71 656 1426: Yes you can
08/02/24, 8:36 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 11AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.

09/02/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Magarezano, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

09/02/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 791 0505: It has been  a pleasure to hear from you on this wonderful  platform
09/02/24, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

09/02/24, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
