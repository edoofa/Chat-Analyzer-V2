06/02/24, 9:34 am - +263 71 728 9827: Good morning to you too. Ofcourse you contacted the right person.

06/02/24, 7:28 pm - +263 71 728 9827: It is a pleasure to connect with you too, I look forward to interacting with you.
06/02/24, 11:12 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
07/02/24, 8:27 am - Gurvinder: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

*Proverbs 1:5:*

*"Let the wise listen and add to their learning.' In the tapestry of progress, education is the thread that weaves nations together. As India seeks wisdom, let us prioritize education, creating a future where knowledge transcends boundaries and resonates more profoundly than ever. A commitment to learning is a commitment to a thriving, united nation."*

Let's continue our interactive session and embrace the transformative power of education
07/02/24, 8:49 am - +263 71 728 9827: Really powerful, thank you and good morning
07/02/24, 9:08 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Maria, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tariro, is that correct?
07/02/24, 9:08 am - Gurvinder changed the group name from "Maria Muveregi_EDOOFA(05/02)GS" to "Maria Muveregi_EDOOFA(05/02)GS IE"
07/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 71 728 9827: Yes it is
07/02/24, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: Since you have gotten to know about the scholarship program from Tariro, can you please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?
07/02/24, 12:00 pm - +263 71 728 9827: Alright
07/02/24, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please share them.
07/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 71 728 9827: So these were the questions:
1) Why do you think Edoofa offers an opportunity to African students
2) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship
Program?
3) Why did you choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants?
4) What do you understand by theEarn While You Learn Program (EWYL) and its uniqueness of the Edoofa Program.
5) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
07/02/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
07/02/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tariro, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tariro’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
07/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 71 728 9827: 1) I think Edoofa aims to provide affordable Education to everyone. 
2) Fill up for an online application or offline
3) Edoofa is  more reliable and  guides you with  counseling sessions and helps you to find a suitable course 
4) Edoofa gives you assignments and if you pass you will be given scholarship credits which will be deducted from your fees, I also heard that another programme was recently introduced and its called scholarship grant where you earn when you do your assignments in the given time frame. 
5) Affordable education, there are resources and it is easy to find employment after completing your studies
07/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 71 728 9827: I learnt about the Earn While you learn pragramme, I also learnt that if I manage to get the scholarship 60 to 100 % will be covered by my sponsors.
07/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 71 728 9827: Tariro did mention a bit about her Journey
07/02/24, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
07/02/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
07/02/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/02/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
07/02/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
07/02/24, 4:10 pm - +263 71 728 9827: Ofcourse it is
07/02/24, 5:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Maria, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
07/02/24, 5:55 pm - +263 71 728 9827: I think I doo
07/02/24, 6:03 pm - +263 71 728 9827: I guess you forgot to add my mother
07/02/24, 10:24 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 11AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
08/02/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*Education is the key to unlocking the golden door of freedom and opportunity. By investing in your child's education, you are investing in yourself, and with knowledge as your foundation, you have the power to shape a future of limitless possibilities. Embrace the journey of learning, for it is the transformative force that propels you towards greatness and opens doors to a world of endless opportunities.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
08/02/24, 8:35 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
08/02/24, 10:41 pm - +263 71 728 9827: Good day to you too

09/02/24, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Computer Application*
09/02/24, 2:42 pm - +263 71 728 9827: I see. Can you please expagorate what the course is all about?
09/02/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, but first, I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
09/02/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/02/24, 2:53 pm - +263 71 728 9827: Yes I am confident about that. I will be working extra hard.
09/02/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the course now.

09/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 71 728 9827: I got much interested after reading this. Thank you for the enlightening, I hope one day I can grow to be a Programmer 🙂.
09/02/24, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: So did you understand the course?
09/02/24, 3:47 pm - +263 71 728 9827: Yes I did
09/02/24, 3:48 pm - +263 71 728 9827: So how long does it take to attain a degree?
09/02/24, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: Please, this is 3 year degree course.
09/02/24, 3:48 pm - +263 71 728 9827: Okay thank you
09/02/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
09/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 71 728 9827: Alright.
So if I manage to to get into the Edoofa's program I will attain a degree and then if possible I'd love to go higher with my studies, after that I will pursue my career and finally become financially dependent, my dream is to settle with my family and have a financially stable life and to also help those who are under previledged. Literally after five years of completing the course I see myself opening my own company with the knowledge I'd have attained through Edoofa's scholarship program.
09/02/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Maria I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
09/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 71 728 9827: Ofcourse sir I'm very willing
09/02/24, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
09/02/24, 4:06 pm - +263 71 728 9827: Firstly it's about affordability and then provision of jobs and finally I believe that the degree attained in India is valid in most countries around the world
09/02/24, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
09/02/24, 4:19 pm - +263 71 728 9827: I think the exposure will  significantly help develop my  intercultural skills, flexibility and adaptability, self-awareness, curiosity, and confidence hence I can share with the younger generations the importance of interacting with other countries
09/02/24, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community NAME, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
09/02/24, 4:21 pm - +263 71 728 9827: I really agreew
09/02/24, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
09/02/24, 4:22 pm - +263 71 728 9827: Ofcourse I wonder too.
09/02/24, 4:22 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
09/02/24, 4:22 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*
