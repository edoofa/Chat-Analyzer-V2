23/01/24, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
23/01/24, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Vimbayi, also do tell me whether you learnt about Vimbayi’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
23/01/24, 2:06 pm - +263 78 271 4456: From Vimbai we learnt that Edoofa help students to
1. Earn While they Learn (E.W.Y.L)
2. You assist with the enrollment of students to Universities
3 you Assist with VISA application
4 you assist with Travel experience through the  journey  to India
5 That you offer scholarship for students
6 That  you offer Career guidance to students
23/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
23/01/24, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/01/24, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/01/24, 10:30 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
24/01/24, 8:21 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better. "*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
24/01/24, 9:28 am - +263 78 271 4456: Good morning I am sorry  my absence was due to power loadsheding I had no power  now am on line
24/01/24, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: So is the issue resolved now?
24/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 78 271 4456: Yes we can proceed
24/01/24, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
24/01/24, 9:58 am - +263 78 271 4456: Yes that's correct  Mr Gurvinder
24/01/24, 9:59 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Zimba, as we start your daughter's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/01/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 271 4456: Yes Mr Gurvinder
24/01/24, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Zimba, I would like to know Makanaka better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about her, her/his career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Her highest education level?
2. The course she would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?
4. What is the parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting her for her Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting her financially for her higher education abroad?
7. Does she have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school does she studies at and in which province is it located along with that how much was her per-term fee in A level?

24/01/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
24/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Ok
24/01/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during Makanaka's introduction you mentioned she would like to study Agronomy, could you please share what motivates her behind this field of study?
24/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Ok Mr Gurvinder Makanaka grew up visiting  my parents who are peasants  farmers  she saw the way they were farming and producing food to eat and a little to sell so what she used to say is I want to study  more and see how the soil  produces food and how does it take for crops to grow in the soil and how does soil take to produce food for the plants and also she was eager to see and know about crop and soil dieses Makana started to look much into soil which she conclude that she wants to gain more knowledge  on soil and plants hence studying Agronoy
24/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Thank you for sharing Makanaka's motivation for studying Agronomy. It's clear that her upbringing in a farming environment, observing her parents as peasant farmers, has deeply influenced her choice. Her curiosity about the soil's role in food production, the growth of crops, and the factors affecting soil health and plant diseases is commendable.
24/01/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share her O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
24/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 271 4456: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Please share for form 5 results too.
24/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Unfortunately for form 5  results she took with here the report book when she went back to school but she had.
 Crop Science. B
Mathematics D

Geography. D

I  hope I did not make an error  on the grades
24/01/24, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why didn't she took Biology if she wanted to Agronomy?
24/01/24, 1:15 pm - +263 78 271 4456: As you can see  Biology  has a Status  M which means it's missing she did wrote the subject and as a result from what we parents gathered  from the  school the whole class Biology result went missing and upto now the school had not given us the reason why it went missing yet the candidates wrote the exam and on the examination fee it was paid and the children wrote but the results went missing  the school could not give us the reason why but they had promised to look into the matter
24/01/24, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Please I am talking about A-level.
24/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Ok am sorry. From what I gathered that was the combination she was given at school I don't know how the school does with the process of selecting but that is what she was given as her combination  for A level
24/01/24, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Considering Makanaka's interest in Crop Science, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Geography would be an excellent choice. Here's why:

Holistic Approach to Agriculture:

The BA in Geography course offers a comprehensive understanding of the earth, including the study of land, climate, and plantations. This holistic approach provides a strong foundation for anyone interested in crop science by incorporating environmental and geographical factors that influence agriculture.
Specialized Subjects Relevant to Agriculture:

The course includes subjects such as Agricultural Geography, Environmental Impact Assessment, Natural Resource Management, and others directly related to agriculture. These subjects will equip Makanaka with the necessary knowledge to understand and contribute to crop science.
Field Trips and Practical Experience:

The annual field trips and practical training in cartography provided by the course are invaluable. Makanaka will have the opportunity to observe and analyze field data, gaining hands-on experience that is crucial for understanding the practical aspects of crop science.
Versatility in Career Paths:

Graduates from BA in Geography are not limited to one specific career path. They can explore various fields, including agriculture research, environmental protection agencies, and NGOs. This versatility aligns well with the diverse aspects of crop science and opens up a range of opportunities for Makanaka.
Potential Roles in Agriculture:

Upon completion of the course, Makanaka could pursue roles such as Agriculture Specialist, where she can work closely with farmers and contribute to the success of agricultural businesses. The understanding of geographical and environmental factors gained from the course will be beneficial in this regard.

It provides a solid foundation for a career in agriculture, aligning well with her passion for understanding how soil, climate, and geographical features influence crop production.
24/01/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Ok thank you with the information
24/01/24, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: So do you want to go ahead with this course?
24/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Yes it's ok
24/01/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
24/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 78 271 4456: May you  please kindly  highlight me  on that
24/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
24/01/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

24/01/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Ok  thank you
24/01/24, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: So now Mrs Gutsa, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
24/01/24, 2:52 pm - +263 78 271 4456: It's actually  Mrs Zimba
24/01/24, 2:53 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you
24/01/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
24/01/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
24/01/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Firstly if I am not mistaken Edoofa is a scholarship which university  do you fall under and also do you choose a university  for  Makanaka
24/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
24/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
24/01/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
24/01/24, 3:09 pm - +263 78 271 4456: With this that is why I want Makanaka to be selected with the Edoofa Schoolship because as a civil servant I can not raise the amount of 15000USD
24/01/24, 3:10 pm - +263 78 271 4456: With Edoofa I think she will go a long way with her studies
24/01/24, 3:11 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Firstly if I am not mistaken Edoofa is a scholarship which university  do you fall under and also do you choose a university  for  Makanaka
24/01/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
24/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Which Universities do you fall under in India
24/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Also as you said BA in Geography would do for Makanaka how long or how many years will it take to complete  the programme
24/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Please go ahead
24/01/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Please we are affiliated with all the globally recognized Universities in India.
24/01/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts in Geography* is 3- year an undergraduate course divided into 6 semesters.
24/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 78 271 4456: So are you  the ones to choose a university  for Makanaka
24/01/24, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: Please, whichever University sends you an acceptance letter, you can choose between them.
24/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Ok thank you
24/01/24, 10:19 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

25/01/24, 11:35 am - +263 78 271 4456: Good morning  Mr Gurvinder
25/01/24, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
25/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Please go on Mr Gurvinder
25/01/24, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Zimba, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
25/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Ok am understanding
25/01/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
25/01/24, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
25/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

25/01/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
25/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Let me read through
25/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Yaa this is a good programme  and it have got many benefits especially thr recruiting and hiring of Edfoofians after their education  there won't  be any hussein in finding  employment  and by this I understand  they gain much experience
25/01/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mrs Zimba, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
25/01/24, 5:03 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Afternoon my network  was giving me problems and also the loads heading now let me go through
25/01/24, 6:56 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you from what I understood the EArn While  You Learn prohramme help a student that part of the fees will be paid through his or her hard working this also reduce a burden to us parent interns of raising  her fees  because we will be left with a little to run about looking  for money  taking a for Ana example with what I earn I will be struggling  to raise enough to send Makanaka to any University  so with the EWYL programme we parents will be helped much and with the example you  gave me it would be much cheaper to send Makanaka to school with the help  of Adoofa scholarship  and the Earn While You Learn
25/01/24, 6:56 pm - +263 78 271 4456: An sorry with the late respond here am experiencing  network problem
26/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 271 4456: Good morning

29/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Yes Sir
29/01/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/01/24, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
29/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Am still downloading  network  is a problem  here but am reading  through
29/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 78 271 4456: I cam see that Adoofa helps much in the learning  of my daughter  since she would be able to self-sponsor her studies and this makes you different  from others and this is exactly  what I was looking for
29/01/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 271 4456: I can see that students  work very  so that  they earn  credits it's very helpful
29/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 271 4456: For Example Muza managed to get 1 670 credits
29/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Zimba, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting Makanaka for the higher education.
29/01/24, 2:34 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Thats correct  Mr Gurvinder
29/01/24, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
29/01/24, 2:47 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Yes am very ready
29/01/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Zimba as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/01/24, 2:54 pm - +263 78 271 4456: If I am correct it adds upto  $1 500-   $2 250
29/01/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs Zimba, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/01/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/01/24, 2:59 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Ok I see what will happen  if I fail to raise  the $350
29/01/24, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Please I will explain, let me continue.
29/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Sorry may you please  continue
29/01/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Ok
29/01/24, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/01/24, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Zimba basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
29/01/24, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
29/01/24, 5:15 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Ok I understand
29/01/24, 11:34 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
30/01/24, 7:50 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 271 4456: Good morning
30/01/24, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
30/01/24, 10:04 am - +263 78 271 4456: May you please  explain  it for me
30/01/24, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
30/01/24, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Zimba, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
30/01/24, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
30/01/24, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
30/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 78 271 4456: Let me read through
30/01/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: Noted, please address this when read.
30/01/24, 11:01 am - +263 78 271 4456: From what I understood stage 5 is for finacial planning  for the entire Tertiary Education
30/01/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
30/01/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
30/01/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
30/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you  as I have seen it you said registration  fee is part of first year fees so does it mean the university notifies of the deduction or it's just automatic deduction
30/01/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: Please, it is well informed.
30/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you
30/01/24, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
30/01/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
30/01/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

02/02/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Go into the world and do well. But more importantly, go into the world and do good.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
02/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 78 271 4456: Good morning
02/02/24, 10:59 am - Gurvinder: *@@263782714456*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
02/02/24, 11:00 am - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Makanaka* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
02/02/24, 11:00 am - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Makanaka’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
02/02/24, 11:50 am - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you very much
02/02/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *8th or 9th of February 2024* for $200 and the *8th or 9th of March 2024* for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *8th or 9th of February 2024*
02/02/24, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
02/02/24, 12:48 pm - +263 78 271 4456: This message was deleted
02/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 271 4456: I think I will  opt for number 1 since I am not finacial stable  since I will be looking forward to paying  Makanaka's exam fee which I am not yet  aware of the amount  needed
02/02/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, are you willing to go ahead as that will be more beneficial to you enrol with the program now rather than later, so should I explain you how?
02/02/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Yes please
02/02/24, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Please, if you enrol with us now, then let us suppose a student manages to earn $100 per month, the student can earn up to $600 in the form of scholarship credits through the EWYL program, which will mean you will get back the enrollment fees and some more which will help you in future to pay the child's University fees too, and I feel knowing this you believe this will be very much beneficial to you, don't you think so?
02/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 271 4456: This is an eye opener and it'such beneficial
02/02/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: So knowing this, don't you think you should enroll with the program now, rather than later, satisfaction of the parents is my top priority as a counsellor, and so to ensure that you are satisfied, I would also be scheduling a Video Call with the program director itself for you?
02/02/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 271 4456: Thank you
