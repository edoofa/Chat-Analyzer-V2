08/02/24, 7:03 pm - Gurvinder: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow morning at 10 AM CAT, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application.
08/02/24, 7:04 pm - +263 71 132 0162: Okay Thank you Mr Gurvinder
09/02/24, 8:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
09/02/24, 9:06 am - +263 71 132 0162: Good morning Sir
09/02/24, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Tafadzwa,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/02/24, 9:32 am - +263 71 132 0162: Its a pleasure to me too Mr Gurvinder
09/02/24, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/02/24, 9:46 am - +263 71 132 0162: My understanding of the Edoofa Program is that the program offers scholarships to students throughout the nations offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and it makes education affordable and accessible  to students and also employability is driven so that  the students become future leaders as well as planning and giving them opportunities through which they can  help themselves
09/02/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, so my understanding is that you previously had a session with Mr Shubham, right?
09/02/24, 9:49 am - +263 71 132 0162: Yes l did a session with Mr Shubham
09/02/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the program again?
09/02/24, 10:02 am - +263 71 132 0162: Yes you may
09/02/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/02/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/02/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/02/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 71 132 0162: That is true
09/02/24, 11:27 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Tafadzwa, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
09/02/24, 11:29 am - +263 71 132 0162: I certainly will meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship
09/02/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: Now Tafadzwa, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

09/02/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 132 0162: What motivates me to study the degree of social work is that it focuses  on preparing students to work in various settings such as schools, hospitals, mental health clinics, and community organizations to help individuals and communities address social issues and improve their well-being. The curriculum typically covers topics such as human behavior, social policy, research methods, and interventions for individuals and groups facing challenges such as poverty, discrimination, mental illness, and substance abuse. Students also learn about ethics, cultural competence, advocacy, and social justice in order to effectively support clients and promote positive change in society. Thus l would love  a  change in the society, nation and country
09/02/24, 12:57 pm - +263 71 132 0162: Social work is a profession that focuses on helping individuals, families, and communities improve their well-being and quality of life therefore l would be happy to change thy society . Social workers work with people facing a variety of challenges, such as poverty, mental health issues, substance abuse, domestic violence, and more. They provide support, advocacy, and resources to help clients navigate difficult situations and access the services they need. Social workers also work to address systemic issues and promote social justice through policy advocacy and community organizing.
09/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Your motivation to study social work, Tafadzwa, is rooted in the diverse opportunities it offers to make a positive impact in various settings and address social issues affecting individuals and communities
