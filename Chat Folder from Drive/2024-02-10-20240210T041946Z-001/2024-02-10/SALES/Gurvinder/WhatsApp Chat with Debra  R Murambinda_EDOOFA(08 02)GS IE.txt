08/02/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/02/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/02/24, 3:00 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Thank you
08/02/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

08/02/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/02/24, 3:03 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Yes, she really wants to study through Edoofa since we struggling to raise her tertiary tuition fees
08/02/24, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Murambinda, as we start your daughter's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/02/24, 3:27 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Yes, I will be able to meet criteria 2.

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen for Debra, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Is she willing to give her 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come her way inorder to transform her career?
09/02/24, 9:15 am - +27 83 890 4515: She is well prepared for that. The rest of her education she has been working very hard, surprising us with her high academic scores, even though she wasn't at a school without sufficient resources.

09/02/24, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that she is willing to work hard for her career, however, can you please tell me why you want to her study abroad and not in your country?
09/02/24, 9:41 am - +27 83 890 4515: We see it as a big advantage for her to train outside the country and get exposed to the international community therefore will have cultural exchange and acquire some knowledge not available in my country

09/02/24, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
09/02/24, 10:06 am - +27 83 890 4515: Yes mister
09/02/24, 10:52 am - +27 83 890 4515: But there must be more that they will gain by studying in India and not any other country
09/02/24, 11:48 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
09/02/24, 12:07 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Yes mister, I now fully understand the capability of India offer the kind of educational that aspires to have. My question is that is possible for her also to work in India after  completion and do you assist her as well
09/02/24, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Murambinda in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
09/02/24, 12:26 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Thank you for highlighting all this to me.I wish you can offer my daughter this opportunity
09/02/24, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
09/02/24, 1:04 pm - +27 83 890 4515: We are not informed of the cost of such higher education in India
09/02/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
09/02/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
09/02/24, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/02/24, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
09/02/24, 1:15 pm - +27 83 890 4515: This is an excellent opportunity for my daughter if she got this chance. She is willing to take it and we will give her the support she needs.
09/02/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
09/02/24, 1:22 pm - +27 83 890 4515: You are welcome
09/02/24, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Murambinda, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
09/02/24, 1:48 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Thank you for the update on this issue. It is very good practice since the child will have that exposure to their job as well
09/02/24, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.

09/02/24, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
09/02/24, 2:20 pm - +27 83 890 4515: This is a good learning program equipping learners with these skills. It definitely help to equiped with practical knowledge.
09/02/24, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that @27838904515, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
09/02/24, 2:25 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Thank you. I am following and getting more information about the goodness of this Edoofa program .
09/02/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

09/02/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
09/02/24, 2:36 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Thank you for the update. This is a very good opportunity and it encourages hardworking and competency from learners
09/02/24, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @27838904515, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
09/02/24, 2:41 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Meaning to say I don't qualify to get financial assistance from Edoofa ?
09/02/24, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: Please if you are found eligible for the program, one still has to pay the rest of the cost of education, may I know, are you willing to support that.
09/02/24, 2:44 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Yes mister. I will be supporting it. Thank you
09/02/24, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
09/02/24, 2:46 pm - +27 83 890 4515: I am ready mister
09/02/24, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: @27838904515 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
09/02/24, 2:52 pm - +27 83 890 4515: It will cost between $1500 to $2250
09/02/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly @27838904515, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
09/02/24, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 2:58 pm - +27 83 890 4515: That is fine mister
09/02/24, 3:03 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Thank you
09/02/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
09/02/24, 3:06 pm - +27 83 890 4515: True  ,that's revolutionary
09/02/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
09/02/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
09/02/24, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
09/02/24, 3:19 pm - +27 83 890 4515: I welcome arrangement mister. I am comfortable with the payment plan
09/02/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
09/02/24, 3:22 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Not familiar to the Edoofa cycle
09/02/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @27838904515, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
09/02/24, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
09/02/24, 3:28 pm - +27 83 890 4515: Yes mister. I iunderstand  mister
09/02/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/02/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
09/02/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
09/02/24, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
09/02/24, 3:31 pm - +27 83 890 4515: I am following and understanding. Thank you
09/02/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
09/02/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
09/02/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
