09/02/24, 8:53 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Katongo, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Kooji, is that correct?
09/02/24, 9:05 am - +260 765019328: Yes it is.
09/02/24, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Kooji, also do tell me whether you learnt about Kooji’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
09/02/24, 9:41 am - +260 765019328: I haven't really learned a lot about the edoofa program from kooji, because the only thing he asked me was if I was interested in pursuing my course in India. Immediately I said I was interested he sent me the Application form and he actually helped fill it in.
I haven't really learnt about kooji's journey with the Edoofa program but all I can say is that his really excited about how things are unfolding with the program.
09/02/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
09/02/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/02/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/02/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
09/02/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
09/02/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/02/24, 9:48 am - +260 765019328: Yes
That's actually very true.
09/02/24, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Katongo, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
09/02/24, 10:02 am - +260 765019328: I definitely have what it takes to meet the two significant metrics.
09/02/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Now Katongo, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way <This message was edited>

09/02/24, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Katongo.
09/02/24, 11:47 am - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study medicine, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
09/02/24, 12:05 pm - +260 765019328: I have a very strong desire to help others
09/02/24, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: That is a noble motivation.
09/02/24, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
09/02/24, 12:15 pm - +260 765019328: No

09/02/24, 12:26 pm - +260 765019328: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 12:26 pm - +260 765019328: I'm currently only having my Grade 12 results
09/02/24, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Katongo, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/02/24, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6.Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of science in Optometry
09/02/24, 12:55 pm - +260 765019328: I definitely understand that.
