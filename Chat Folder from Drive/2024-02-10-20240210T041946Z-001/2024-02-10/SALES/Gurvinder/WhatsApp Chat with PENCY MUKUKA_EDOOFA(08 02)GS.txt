09/02/24, 8:18 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Pency, Mr and Mrs Mukuka!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
09/02/24, 11:03 am - +260 96 3265672: Pardon my tardiness,I am here now
09/02/24, 11:03 am - +260 96 3265672: And yes,you have contacted the right person
09/02/24, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Pency,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/02/24, 12:10 pm - +260 96 3265672: Alright Mr.Gurvinder
09/02/24, 12:11 pm - +260 96 3265672: Greetings Mr. Piiyush and Mr. Jyotishman
09/02/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Pency, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Kooji , is that correct?
09/02/24, 12:24 pm - +260 96 3265672: Yes sir
09/02/24, 12:47 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Kooji, also do tell me whether you learnt about Kooji’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
09/02/24, 12:58 pm - +260 96 3265672: He really didn't tell me much about the program, but he did tell me that at the time he was doing a community burden project where her had to send applications to his friends for a scholarship. Of course I was interested and I asked for an application form and I completed it by putting my particulars on it.
09/02/24, 12:59 pm - +260 96 3265672: He also said he got 50% sponsorship and that I could get 50%, 75% or 100% sponsorship too.
09/02/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
09/02/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/02/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/02/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
09/02/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

09/02/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
09/02/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/02/24, 1:13 pm - +260 96 3265672: Yes sir. I want to study abroad but I was afraid of the expenses my parents would have to handle,so when kooji told me about the scholarship program I was all in.

The earn as you learn program also makes having job experience easier, it's a win win situation. <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Pency, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
09/02/24, 1:16 pm - +260 96 3265672: Yes sir. Though I think I have to invite my guardians into the group in order to do that. <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Now Pency, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
09/02/24, 1:55 pm - +260 96 3265672: - My name is Pency Mukuka, a Zambian aged 19 years old. I was born on the 4th of June ,2004.
- The highest education level I have attained is an ordinary level school certificate at the Examinations Council of Zambia, graduating from legacy school in solwezi with 11 points best 6 subjects standard.
- I would like to study Civil engineering because my goal is to improve the housing industry here in Zambia.
- Growing up in an extended family of 9 children with a small overly priced house made me think ahead on what I wanted to do with my life
- My guardians who looked after me since I was 9, also sponsored all of my education until I completed my senior secondary studies.
- My uncle is an electrical engineering by profession currently working at BISHA MINING in Eritrea as a superintendent
- My aunt is a housewife, but completely her senior secondary studies and graduated.
- My aunt and uncle will be sponsoring my higher education abroad.
- I have one biological sibling currently doing his grade 7 studies
Two older siblings who both did computer science and one of them is working for BARRICK LUMWANA.
I also have another older sibling who studied medicine and is now working as a pharmacist
Three of my siblings are doing their primary education and one doing his grade 12 this year.
- At legacy school during my grade 12 studies, my uncle was paying THREE THOUSAND ZAMBIAN KWACHA each term.
09/02/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you, Pency.
09/02/24, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: I feel like you have a close-knit family, so don't you think, they should also be a part of this session?
09/02/24, 2:01 pm - +260 96 3265672: I do,but they are currently not home. I am home alone and they are not picking up their phones,so for now I am alone in this session
09/02/24, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Please add them to the group, so that they can follow the session when they are online.
09/02/24, 2:01 pm - +260 96 3265672: But as soon as they get back to me I'll catch them up to speed
09/02/24, 2:02 pm - +260 96 3265672: Will do Mr. Gurvinder
09/02/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please do it, I have already made you an admin.
09/02/24, 2:07 pm - +260 96 3265672: Alright let me add them
09/02/24, 2:09 pm - ~ Anonymous added +260 776594158, +260 96 3683716, +260 96 6398023, +260 96 6998628 and +260 97 1912553
09/02/24, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Civil engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
09/02/24, 2:10 pm - +260 96 3265672: I've added my mom, uncle and aunt, and my two older siblings
09/02/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
09/02/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
09/02/24, 2:17 pm - +260 96 3265672: I would like to do civil engineering because I have seen many people in my community having poorly planned living structures ,and these structures are small while the people living in them are numerous.
When I ask them why they live like that they say they cut back on housing rent in order to pay for their children's school fees, which is kind of sad .

What also motivates me is the potential of my country to grow economically,I believe if people can get better planned and bigger houses that are affordable, people will work and live better, and this alone will help Zambia improve. <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: Your motivation to pursue civil engineering, driven by the desire to address the housing challenges in your community and contribute to the economic growth of Zambia, is truly inspiring.
09/02/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
09/02/24, 2:20 pm - +260 96 3265672: Nobody that I know of.
09/02/24, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your Grade 10 and Grade 11 results for evaluation?
09/02/24, 2:38 pm - +260 96 3265672: Okay. Though I have only managed to get my grade 11 results
09/02/24, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Please share them.
09/02/24, 2:39 pm - +260 96 3265672: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 2:39 pm - +260 96 3265672: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 2:40 pm - +260 96 3265672: Could I also send my results for the Examinations Council of Zambia ordinary level school certificate
09/02/24, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, why didn't you take pure physics and pure chemistry, if you wanted to Civil engineering?
09/02/24, 2:41 pm - +260 96 3265672: My guardians never took me to schools that offered pure subjects.
09/02/24, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Pency, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/02/24, 2:45 pm - +260 96 3265672: Does that mean I do not qualify for this scholarship program because I never did pure physics, chemistry and math. <This message was edited>
09/02/24, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Please, that means I can offer you a course in any other field, like your brothers, I can offer you a course in Computer Science.
09/02/24, 2:51 pm - +260 96 3265672: What about architecture?
09/02/24, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Please, that also requires one to have Pure Physics and Pure Chemistry.
09/02/24, 2:52 pm - +260 96 3265672: I see
09/02/24, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please.
