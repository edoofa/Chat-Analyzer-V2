31/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 259 4208: So far l have paid $450 .
Sir l sent you my concerns yesterday but you did not respond. Can you kindly respond please.
31/08/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Absolutely, @263712594208. In order to address your query effectively, I kindly request some input from your end to ensure I fully comprehend your question. It appears that I may not have completely understood your initial message. Could you please rephrase or provide additional details to help me better grasp your inquiry?

Your assistance in providing more context would be greatly appreciated.
31/08/23, 3:35 pm - +263 71 259 4208: Ok sir .ln our previous communication, l was advised that off campus fee is about $1200 per annum including food and other requirements.
My question is on the food component. I wanted know who serves the food. And when l talked to Eugene she said the students prepare their on food solely. So l asked myself how possible is it and it was not clear during our previous communication.

The other issue was the $105 and $296 respectively advance payments which if added to $1200 this will sum up to close to the On campus .
31/08/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263712594208 the off-campus accommodation cost shared with you was $800, which includes the facility of self-cooking. Students have the privilege to cook their own food, get food from outside, or opt for a food service. The society where Ms. Eugene has found an apartment for Wasikanaka has African shops, so the local food, such as Sadza, will be available. 

The $105 you are paying covers the first month's rent and the security deposit of $35, which will be refunded to Wasikanakana after he leaves the apartment. The $296 you are paying is for furnishing the place, and all the belongings that will be given can be resold after he leaves the apartment. Hence, these costs should not be factored into the per annum expense, as they act as the security deposit and will be refunded to Wasikanakana once he leaves the place. 

The monthly rent is $35, and the food cost would be around $25, making the total monthly expense $60 for an average student. If you span this out for 12 months, the total cost of living comes to around $720, and the amount shared with you was $800 and hence is within the same range. If you feel there seems to be any discrepancy in our conversation, please let me know, and I will help you further.

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 08:10 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
03/09/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

03/09/23, 2:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Wasikananka 2K22NOV1092*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.


5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India
03/09/23, 2:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

04/09/23, 7:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings,

I have a crucial update to share with all of you. As you may be aware, whenever one makes an International money transfer, there is an amount charged by the bank which is usually around 18%. Due to exchange in fluctuation, Ms. Eugene has received the less amount needed for your resrvation. 

In order to cover the difference, a payment of $35 is now required to successfully book your accommodation. For more details and instructions regarding this payment, please reach out to Ms. Eugene directly. She will provide you with all the necessary information.
04/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 259 4208: I understand you but it's like lam being confused coz before l sent the $450 l first talked to Eugene about the money and she approved $450. Now at this hour what do l do when Wasikananka is on her way to the airport for tomorrow. Really is difficult to understand.

Is it not possible for her to make the payment when she arrives?

I thank you in advance.
21/09/23, 11:18 am - +91 93546 23922: Greetings Parents, I will directly talk to eugene and ask her to help them with the accommodation issue
21/09/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 259 4208: Please Mr Mukund ,l saying talk to them first and get their story and then engage Eugene. I talked to her about the furniture which she said she bought two single beds.
No tables
Not chairs
Stove shared by two pairs and is a two plate stove
Fitted wardrobe
21/09/23, 11:33 am - +91 93546 23922: I understand your issue, give me some time to talk to them
21/09/23, 11:34 am - +91 93546 23922: Eugene just called me and told me that she has been talking to the parents
21/09/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 259 4208: Welcome and waiting
21/09/23, 11:34 am - +91 93546 23922: is that true?
21/09/23, 11:34 am - +91 93546 23922: are your doubts cleared
21/09/23, 11:38 am - +263 71 259 4208: It's true that l talked to her but l did not want to show her that was not satisfied with her explanation hence thought of engaging you. I can share communication  with her if you like
21/09/23, 11:46 am - +91 93546 23922: thats fine
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: Good morning Sister Eugene.l hope l find you well.
I really appreciate what you have  done so far.l just need to know one or two things from you.
1.Yes Wasikananka has got her sharing accommodation,but did so she get her furniture as per agreement?
2.Remember she paid for non sharing accommodation of which was not our request.How far have you gone on settling this?
3.May you please high light to me what you have purchased on furniture and what is left.
Iam requesting this coz it's high time the kids should be settled by now. Thank you , while waiting for your cordial response
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: She paid sharing 
Whats left is a table and a chair 
The house is fitted with everything else that she requires 
The fridge i had jointly purchased the one in the house because her roommate had not made a full payment which allows me to finish furnishing
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: Ok thank you for sharing that but if the room is fitted how are the payments treated and is the fridge and stove only used by the two or otherwise?
If her roommate did not pay enough how would you treat Wasikananka 's full payment against her and can she continue to be held that way?
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: The house was more expensive than initial budget due to the fact that a fitted kitchen and bedroom are considered furnished homes so instead of requesting for more money on the accomodation part i redirected the funds towards the house 
And as for stove the house if im not mistaken has pipeline gas 
Her roommate is soon to pay then i purchase it 
It was jus a matter of her understanding for the mean time the financial situation of her roomate
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: I really appreciate your responses. All l need to understand is, are you saying that because of the house being fitted it affects the monthly rentals from our previous communication? And for sure she has to accommodate her friend 's shortfalls in the meantime time coz they have adopted each other as sisters. But their quires should be addressed soon. The stove, fridge,study tables etc should be available for the to live comfortably like anyone else. Thankful
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: Its okay i understand your concerns as a parent as well
I had told her everything will be sorted out and her house has a stove already its table and fridge
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: Noted
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: Iam sorry l have come back,to you rescue.The house has a stove but shared by four students why ? And it's a two plate stove. The money which was paid doesn't reflect the expenditure.($486 USD) 
The way things are done it not very clear to me. The sum should tally with the expenditures by the end of the day.l know you may feel offended but thus it. You purchased single beds instead of 3/4 beds and at what cost? Please lay out your expenditure clearly so that you meet my satisfaction.
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: The single beds i bought were for sharing rooms because 3/4 beds will render the room without space 
Secondly for the beds i bought soft mattresses which are expensive in india 
Indians use hard beds so soft mattresses are expensive
The students use a 2 plate stove not at the same time but they cook individually 
The kitchen counter can only accomodate a single stove not 2 
On the 486 there are charges included so subtracting those you paid 435 if you remember 
Thirdly there was a facilitation fee from all students from that amount that was for the service provided to them  of 35usd 
The tables and the rest are yet to be provided as mentioned above
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: Now l get it clear and hope everything gonna be sorted out soon.Thank you very much for your patience.
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: No its okay its good to ask tobatsirana kuwonesana how things are moving
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: It's really good to know especially when money is involved things should be clear.l will be calling you every time when things are not going well there madam. Iike in the case of a stove ,who owns it between the two pairs?
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: Its joint ownership
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 259 4208: Noted
21/09/23, 11:51 am - +263 71 259 4208: This is our chart with Eugene Mr Mukund
21/09/23, 12:38 pm - +91 93546 23922: Alright
21/09/23, 12:40 pm - +91 93546 23922: I have tried talking to her so she can help wasikanka altogether also We want to clarify that we are not responsible for Eugene's accommodation issue. Our endorsement of Eugene pertains to her as a source of help that she provides and this was made clear before too, we hope you understand the same.
We remain committed to Wasikanka's academic journey and well-being.
Thank you for your understanding.
21/09/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 259 4208: I understand you. All the same you remain concerned if she doesn't get good service,and of which you won't achieve your goal. The guarantee of safety and comfort is from  you through Eugene. If you can tell us not to air our grievances through your office,that means we are closed out and leading for doom. So let's work together as parents solve these minor issues. It's just making things straight. Thank you for your understanding.
21/09/23, 12:53 pm - +91 93546 23922: There is iThank you for your message, and I appreciate your concerns. I completely understand that you want the best service and guarantee of safety and comfort for your child through Eugene. It's important that we work together as parents to address any minor issues and make things right for everyone involved.

Please feel free to share your grievances and concerns with me, and I will do my best to ensure they are addressed appropriately. Our goal is to create a positive and supportive environment for your child, and I'm committed to working towards that goal with you.

Did you manage to talk to Eugene productively and also with the concerned kids?  I am told lessons start on the 1st of October and their furniture is not available. If it is difficult for her to fulfill her obligation,l suggest she makes a refund and they do the purchase themselves.
03/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 259 4208: Mr Mukund,how are you sir? I am sure l find you well.
As per our previous discussion on Wasikananka 's welfare , Eugene has done nothing so far. Please l again appeal to you for intervention.lf she is failing to get the items can Eugene give her the money l paid for her to purchase the items.

We sent the money in good faith through her but it like we are being arm twisted. She has totally failed . Please do something now for my kid. Iam not begging her but it's our right to get the service for our money. I thank you in advance.
03/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 71 259 4208: @263712594208 the off-campus accommodation cost shared with you was $800, which includes the facility of self-cooking. Students have the privilege to cook their own food, get food from outside, or opt for a food service. The society where Ms. Eugene has found an apartment for Wasikanaka has African shops, so the local food, such as Sadza, will be available. 

The $105 you are paying covers the first month's rent and the security deposit of $35, which will be refunded to Wasikanakana after he leaves the apartment. The $296 you are paying is for furnishing the place, and all the belongings that will be given can be resold after he leaves the apartment. Hence, these costs should not be factored into the per annum expense, as they act as the security deposit and will be refunded to Wasikanakana once he leaves the place. 

The monthly rent is $35, and the food cost would be around $25, making the total monthly expense $60 for an average student. If you span this out for 12 months, the total cost of living comes to around $720, and the amount shared with you was $800 and hence is within the same range. If you feel there seems to be any discrepancy in our conversation, please let me know, and I will help you further.

We hope this message finds you in good spirits. ☀️

I have an important update to share with you that the university officials have successfully concluded the process for setting up bank accounts specifically tailored for our international students. This marks a crucial step towards ensuring a seamless and enriching experience during your tenure at our university.
01/12/23, 10:38 am - +91 93546 23922: In order to open a bank account, all the students are required to visit any nearby branch of the *Punjab and Sind Bank*. To commence this process, it is mandatory for all international students to make a brief visit to the International Relations Office by today, before 4:00 PM. We've discussed the same with the Officials of the International Relations Department at Galgotias University and taken the liberty to prepare Bonafide letters for you since it is a mandatory requirement in opening a bank account with Punjab and Sind Bank.

When you drop by, kindly ensure to bring along a copy of your FRRO Registration Form. This will enable the officials to efficiently compile the necessary paperwork required for you.
