I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Walusungu's higher education?

We have also made sure he has access to data bundle for his communication.

12/09/23, 2:45 pm - +265 888 55 44 05: Kindly note that our son Walusungu is not included in this forum. Kindly include him
04/10/23, 9:14 am - +265 888 15 92 86: Good morning! As parents, would like to express our sincere gratitude on the progress our son Walusungu is making with EWYL program. Meanwhile, we would like to have an update regarding the way forward. Especially the university if at al it is already identified. We also need to know the milestones/time lines for planning purposes. We are happy to inform you that Walusungu passed his O-Level exams with 19 point (he has distinction and credits only. Waiting to hearing from you soon.
05/10/23, 5:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I would like to first Congratulate you and Walusungu for achieving such a great result⭐. I am sure he is going to make you proud.
06/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to connect with you yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/10/23, 2:06 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Sorry am seeing the message now. Yes we can connect now
06/10/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education isB.Tech (Civil Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
06/10/23, 2:20 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: The information regarding the course is true. But the arrival even if it is earlier that the stated date is very much welcome. Unless the procedures are too long otherwise we wanted him to start earlier
06/10/23, 2:21 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: I may have forgotten, when does a normal academic year start in India?
06/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright @265888159286 let me help remind you, that the academic year in India commences in the Month of August every year.
06/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. MSCE Result/Letter of Recommendation/*

*2. JCE Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
06/10/23, 2:24 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Thanks for the reminder. With this then this year is ruled out since we are now in October already. So you are right, it's August 2024. The course is B. Tech (Civil Engineering)
06/10/23, 2:26 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Thanks and will organise the documents. How soon are they required? Because I will have to get them from different offices in different places
06/10/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Since the admission for the 2024 intake is open now through Edoofa, so can I anticipate that you will be able to share the documents by tomorrow 10:00 am?
06/10/23, 2:32 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Ooohhh tomorrow is too soon, especially considering that tomorrow is Saturday and offices are closed. Is next week Tuesday too late?
06/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern about the timing. Waiting until next week on Tuesday should not be a significant issue, especially if offices are closed during the weekend. So can I anticipate that you will be able to collect the academic documents on 10th of October which is Tuesday?
06/10/23, 2:43 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Thank you very much for understanding. I would say yes by Tuesday. I will talk to the headmaster of Chaminade Marianist to get them ready by Monday, and I will have to drive 360 kilometer to get the documents sine I stay very far from the capital Lilongwe where the documents are
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You're very welcome, and thank you for the update. It sounds like you have a plan in place to obtain the necessary documents despite the considerable distance you have to travel. Alright, let us reconnect on Tuesday.
06/10/23, 3:21 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Thanks and enjoy your weekend ahead. Catch up on Tuesday
06/10/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you have a great weekend to you too.

I hope this message finds you well, thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, could you please share your national ID for the time being once you have collected his birth certificate you can share it again after a week, I hope this plan sounds acceptable?
11/10/23, 12:39 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is very much in order, and thanks for the flexibility

11/10/23, 12:42 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Thanks for sharing the image. I do remember it very well
11/10/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 12:45 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: A quick one is that we as parents and your office have discussed quite a lot and passed through several stages until stage 3. Now we are waiting for offer letter which is stage 4. But I should also mention that we were briefed on all the stages so that we know what is expected
11/10/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
11/10/23, 12:56 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: So far so good. but a few concerns. While we appreciate the process is rigorous, but as parents we need to be safe by securing a place early in a reputable university. Otherwise, Walusungu and ourselved may feel desperate and spend money on other universities here in Malawi in trying to cast our net wide. This is because one year to August 2024 is a long period of waiting. But if we can be assured of the offer letter, then we shall comfortably wait for the academic year. Secondly we appreciate that Walusngu is participating in EWYL which is very good. Our request as parents is that once in a while you need to update us so that we appreciate the achievements our son is making, especially that we are not in the forum for EWYL
11/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concerns and appreciate your perspective as parents. It's natural to want to secure a place in a reputable university as early as possible. We at Edoofa are dedicated to helping students like Walusungu succeed in their academic journey and that is why we have a piece of exciting news that awaits you as we move ahead with our discussion. Rest assured we can work on providing you with regular updates on Walusungu's progress and achievements in the EWYL program and we will do our best to keep you informed about his accomplishments and milestones. 

However, let me even tell you that parents can also be in the student EWYL group, may I know if you were able to join the group as well?
11/10/23, 1:07 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Thanks for your assurance and dedication towards Walusungu's academic journey. We are included in the EWYL22E0600 group. But it seems there is another group besides EWYL22E0600 group. Unless if it is only meant for his assignment/tasks then no need. The group in which we are is enough
11/10/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please there is another platform only assigned for the projects and tasks. So please no do not worry about that. Now let us move ahead. As we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
11/10/23, 1:13 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Yes yes I thought so too, that possibly it was meant for assignment only. So our guess was right. That is in order. Yes we can proceed to the third step. However, I wanted to request if we can continue another day because my lunch time is over and I have to go back to work now. If that is ok with you
11/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Of course we can reschedule, may I know if you will be available to connect with us today ta 08:00 pm?
11/10/23, 1:15 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: That is ok with me. Anytime from 7pm is ok because I will be back from work. I knock off at 5pm
11/10/23, 8:06 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Am available online
11/10/23, 8:06 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Waiting for you
11/10/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @265888159286 I hope you are doing well, it is a pleasure to connect with you again today.
11/10/23, 8:08 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Great
11/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are ready to start with the counseling on the university admission.
11/10/23, 8:09 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Yes am ready
11/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/10/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/10/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/10/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/10/23, 8:18 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is understood and very clear. Thanks for this enlightening information
11/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/10/23, 8:22 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is clear and our counsellor discussed with us at length on registration issues. This is correct and in order
11/10/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 8:25 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: We are very much on the same page. This was also well explained to us during the previous counselling sessions. We are aware of these costs and the example you have used is very clear
11/10/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/10/23, 8:28 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Very much taken note of. 
It's clear
11/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
11/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
11/10/23, 8:40 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is clear and noted
11/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/10/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/10/23, 8:50 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is well noted with thanks. It is clear
11/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 8:52 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: I am following. But I need a little clarity. Which one starts between admission and registration?
11/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, the registration fee is $750 which was shared above in the example this fee is required to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero. The remaining amount is the admission fee which can be paid once the student arrives in India, please.

I hope we are clear here?
11/10/23, 8:58 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Its clear. So it means we start with registration first and then admission upon arrival in India.
11/10/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat.
11/10/23, 9:01 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Very clear even from the above conversation
11/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps. <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
11/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/10/23, 9:09 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is in order
11/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
11/10/23, 9:17 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is noted and clear
11/10/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/10/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Walusungu as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/10/23, 9:21 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is exciting and fantastic news to hear
11/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 9:24 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: I can't believe it. It's exciting news to hear. This is great. Unbelievable
11/10/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
11/10/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 9:28 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is clear and good news
11/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/10/23, 9:35 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is clear and understood
11/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/10/23, 9:37 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: No questions this far
11/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Walusungu's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Walusungu is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
11/10/23, 9:40 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: A big YES and super excited
11/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate his application after which if they accept his application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
11/10/23, 9:44 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is well noted and thanks for the counselling session on the admission process. Looking forward and regards to your family too
11/10/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
13/10/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Walusungu,

I hope this message finds you well. I have received feedback from the admissions team regarding the documents you provided for Walusungu. During their evaluation process before sharing the application with the universities, the team noticed a discrepancy in the name on the JCE result, and the MSCE result lacks a name entirely. If these documents were shared for evaluation as they are, there was a high likelihood that the universities would reject the application. Therefore, I am reaching out to seek clarification on this matter. Could you please provide more information to assist in resolving this issue?
13/10/23, 2:18 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Good afternoon!
Let me check in the smart school again where I downloaded under Walusungu and get back to you
13/10/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I shall wait for your response.
13/10/23, 2:20 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: I have noted that the name for the JCE is wrong indeed. Let me ask the The Principal of the school who sent me the results. He sent a wrong copy indeed.
13/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I will wait for your response and correct documents.
13/10/23, 2:22 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: But the O-level results which I downloaded from smart school is correct.
13/10/23, 2:22 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Apology for the inconvenience
13/10/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The MSCE results that you downloaded are correct, and I am not denying that fact, however, the results lack the name of the student entirely and if the university is unable to match the name on the result there is a high chance they will reject the application, I hope you understand since verification is very important?
13/10/23, 2:49 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: I do understand. Let me get back into the Smart school system and download again. Regarding the JCE, I have contacted the Principal of Chaminade to send the correct one
13/10/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I will wait for your response.
14/10/23, 8:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Walusungu.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Gulzar Group of Institutes in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 8:52 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive.

14/10/23, 8:53 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and WAlusungu!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutes by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 1:10 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Good afternoon. Apology I was out of home and have just arrived now. Let me go through what you have shared and get back to you soon
14/10/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. May you please go through the letter and let me know once you are done.
14/10/23, 1:43 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Hello!! I have gone through the information and the offer letter too. Its really exciting. Once you find space we can discuss in details. If you do not mind, can we discuss in the evening like we did last time?
14/10/23, 1:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand that dear. However, on that note, if I may ask would you be comfortable in continuing with the discussion now?
14/10/23, 1:49 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: If you cannot make it in the evening like we did last time, then lets do it now.
14/10/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear. Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now please?
14/10/23, 1:51 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Yes I have gone through it
14/10/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
14/10/23, 1:54 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Alright let e go through it again and answer the questions you have asked
14/10/23, 1:59 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: 1) tutition fee is 1225 per annum; 2) 1200 per annum; 3)registration fee is 750
14/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1225. <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
14/10/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. Three Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a three-seater (three people staying together) hostel is $1250, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a three-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225 + $1250) = $2475.

2. Four Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a Four -seater (four people staying together) hostel is $1000, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a four-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225 + $1000) = $2225.
14/10/23, 2:12 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Thanks for the information. But I need a clarification. when you are saying three or four seater with Mess, does it mean that it is one room in which three or four students sleep together? or how does it look like. How can you describe it to a layman.
14/10/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Of course, here's a shorter explanation:

*1. Three Seater with Mess*: This means three students share one room with individual beds. It's air-conditioned, and meals are provided.

*2. Four Seater with Mess*: In this option, four students share one room with individual beds, air-conditioning, and meal services included.

I hope this is clear now?
14/10/23, 5:21 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Yes this is clear. Only that at a later time before Walusungu comes, as parents will need to read the rules and regulations for the accommodation. Come that time may have further issues for clarity after reading
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Walusungu!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you can do that and if you have any queries about that, I am here to help you with that. For now, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead with our discussion please?
16/10/23, 7:05 am - +265 888 15 92 86: Yes yes good morning. Can we link up in the afternoon?
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Walusungu!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. May I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here now please?
16/10/23, 12:49 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: We can move ahead now
16/10/23, 7:25 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Yes am clear
16/10/23, 8:41 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: One question which we have as parents is regarding a specific university to which Walusungu is going to study. We are excited with the offer, but we also realise that the offer is from Gulzar Group of Institutions. In our understanding, this group has several colleges/universities. As such, we would like to know a specific university within the GGI to which our son is offered a place to. This will help us to closely check the credentials of the university such as ranking, accreditation location, internationalisation etc etc. Kindly update us
17/10/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Walusungu!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I completely understand your desire to have more specific information about the university within the Gulzar Group of Institutions to which Walusungu has been offered a place. The offer you received is indeed from the Gulzar Group of Institutions, which is a respected and renowned educational group in India. Moreover, GGI is affiliated with I.K. Gujral Punjab Technical University (PTU).

I.K. Gujral Punjab Technical University (PTU) is among the top universities in India. It's known for its commitment to academic excellence, research, and innovation. PTU has a strong focus on internationalization, and it collaborates with various institutions and organizations worldwide to provide students with global exposure and opportunities.
17/10/23, 1:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I hope this information helps alleviate any concerns and assures you of the quality of education and experience Walusungu will have at GGI?

18/10/23, 3:34 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: <Media omitted>

19/10/23, 12:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Walusung!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 12:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, shall we move ahead with our discussion here please?
20/10/23, 11:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Walusng!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: It has been quite some time since I have been trying to have a proper conversation with you here regarding your offer letter from GGI. Now, with each passing day, we are approaching the deadline date given by the university to complete your admission process, however, due to the fact that I am not getting a proper response from your side, we are unable to move ahead. 

On that note, can you please let me know of the right time by when we can connect with each other here to proceed with the same?
20/10/23, 3:37 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Lets connect now. I am sorry that I am also busy at work and I have to squeeze in to find proper space to sustain the conversation. We can now connect for an hour
20/10/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, before we move ahead, can you please let me know if you are clear till here please?
20/10/23, 3:41 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Yes I am clear, but as said last time. will talk about accommodation issues as we get closer.
20/10/23, 3:42 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: You also explained very well regarding the accreditation issue which is fine. However, it was going to be excellent if as parents we knew the exact name of the school within the group. But if that cannot be established now, then it is fine and good
20/10/23, 3:44 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: I hope from our side so far we have managed to submit all the required documents (JCE results, MSCE results & birthe certificate). Are you happy? any more docements needed from our side?
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that the name of the school is Gulzar Group of Institutes please, as written in the offer letter. I hope you are clear with this?
20/10/23, 8:49 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Its ok am clear because that is written in the letter. Only that I thought as Gulzar Group they have several colleges/Universities under it. But that is the name of the university, then it is fine and no problem
20/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 9:25 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This very clear and was also emphasized in our previous counselling sessions
20/10/23, 9:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2225 and so the balance fee becomes $2225 - $1000 = $1225 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure.
20/10/23, 9:27 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Yes yes! this makes it very very affordable indeed
20/10/23, 9:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.
20/10/23, 9:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: At the same time, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well - 

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee of $2225 , therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2225 - $750= $1475, and that can be paid in two parts of $737 & $738 at a gap of 6 months. 

Are we on the same page here as well?
20/10/23, 9:29 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Yes we are on the same page
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
20/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/10/23, 9:31 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This is well noted with thanks
20/10/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/10/23, 9:34 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: I am a Malawian and residing in Malawi in Mzuzu the northerm part closer to Tanzania
20/10/23, 9:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for the confusion please. Now, in that case, the payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, and since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Malawi, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account through a Telegraphic Transfer. Are you clear with this as well?
20/10/23, 9:37 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: I can check with my bank here if it is possible to pay using the account you have put on the offer letter or not  and update you tomorrow
20/10/23, 9:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 9:39 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: No more queries this far
20/10/23, 9:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

20/10/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
20/10/23, 9:44 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Thank you and indeed will have the discussion with the family and connect with you again tomorrow
20/10/23, 9:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alrigh, please have a blessed evening ahead.
20/10/23, 9:47 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: You to thanks
21/10/23, 8:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Walusungu!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from GGI. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from GGI as a family yet?
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Walusungu!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/10/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: I Was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter from GGI. Now, moving ahead, shall we continue with our conversation here about the same?
23/10/23, 10:28 am - +265 888 15 92 86: Sorry were tied up. But all in all as a family we are excited and ok. We are now just looking into safety of sending the money/ paying within the prescribed period/ deadline
23/10/23, 10:29 am - +265 888 55 44 05: Morning. We did and were excited with the offer as a family
23/10/23, 10:49 am - Milan Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I'm confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I'm curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
24/10/23, 10:04 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Happy Dussehra to you and the entire team at Edoofa.
Let's connect tomorrow as proposed. Have a good night
25/10/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents Walusungu!
I hope you are having a good day.

Thank you for your wish ☺️! Now, our scheduled session is today at 12:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started? <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 1:19 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Sorry for the delay. We can get started
25/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, I'm glad to see that your family is so pleased with the offer letter, and it's wonderful to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I'd like to ask if you would like me to address any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
25/10/23, 1:25 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: No specific question because you addressed almost everything. The only hiccup is when we went to the bank to start the process, they advised to verify the account first before making ayment because they said it seems not a GGI account. The bank name seems different
25/10/23, 1:26 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: We told them we are dealing with Edoofa but still they said there are not Edoofa account details
25/10/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, I understand that. Now, I believe this confusion may have come to surface because on the letter, it is written Anhad Edutrain Solutions on Bank Details, right?
25/10/23, 1:28 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Yes and that is what the bank was asking
25/10/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for confirming, please. Now, let me help you in getting clarity on that. Edoofa and Anhad Edutrain Solutions are indeed connected. Anhad Edutrain Solutions is the parent company of Edoofa. It has been working in the field of education and training for more than 15 years now. Edoofa is one of the initiatives under Anhad Edutrain Solutions, specializing in providing scholarship opportunities for students to pursue higher education in India. I hope this is understood to you now?
25/10/23, 1:33 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: This clarifies the concern. This was not known to us and it's first time to hear. This is clear
25/10/23, 1:36 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: So it means the offer letter we have is co- written by the university (GGI)  and Edoofa through Anhad Edutrain right?
25/10/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is very right! This means that the university is only offering the scholarship offer letter because the student, in our case Walusungu is an Edoofian. I hope this is clear?
25/10/23, 1:40 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: Very clear indeed
25/10/23, 1:40 pm - +265 888 15 92 86: So what next?
01/11/23, 3:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Walusungu!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/11/23, 3:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in a meeting. Moving ahead, let us continue with our discussion here.
01/11/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, I wanted to share an update with you here that the payment of registartion fee that you made earlier, has been confirmed from the side of the accounts team please.
01/11/23, 3:10 pm - +265 888 55 44 05: 🙏
23/11/23, 7:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Walusungu,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 7:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?
23/11/23, 8:07 pm - +265 888 55 44 05: The feedback on a cleared fees transaction is appreciated.
Secondly, we look forward to receiving admission acceptance letters , preferably from a number of universities from where we can make an informed choice .
23/11/23, 8:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have taken a note of my message @265888554405.
01/12/23, 6:45 pm - +265 888 55 44 05: Good evening, I tried to Google Lovely University, it's in Punjab, away from New Delhi. In our initial engagements, it was hinted that the earmarked schools would be in Newdelh.
We kindly request that we be given options in schools in Newdelh
01/12/23, 6:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Walusungu, Wishing you a good day!

Let me help you here, Once you gave the team a go-ahead to proceed with your university admission process, your application was shared with multiple universities which were applicable to your course and were recommended by the Academic Board. Lovely Professional University is one of those universities and they are currently evaluating your application, and if they decide to offer a scholarship to you, they will send you an offer letter. <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After getting another offer letter, if you decide to change your university to LPU, you will be able to do the same without paying any additional amount of money. Otherwise, if you are comfortable with your current choice then you can stay with the same. Are you clear on this?
01/12/23, 6:56 pm - +265 888 55 44 05: Noted. Wr waiting for offer letters
01/12/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Have a great weekend ahead!
