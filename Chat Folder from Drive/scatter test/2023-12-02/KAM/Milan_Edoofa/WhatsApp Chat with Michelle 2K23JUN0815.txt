I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
17/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Good evening Ms Kirti 

It is noted with thanks

Yes we're available to connect with you
07/10/23, 10:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 261 5346: I recall the procedure
07/10/23, 10:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 261 5346: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 10:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
07/10/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 261 5346: Not at all
07/10/23, 10:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
07/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 261 5346: Yes
07/10/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
07/10/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
07/10/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
07/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 261 5346: I'm following ma'am
07/10/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
07/10/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
07/10/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
07/10/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
07/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 261 5346: I have reviewed the benefits ma'am
07/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and great weekend ahead.
07/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Noted ma'am
09/10/23, 5:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Michelle.

I hope you are doing well. with regard to our conversation on Saturday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
09/10/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Good evening Ms Kirti
09/10/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes we're available to connect with you
09/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great so may I know if you were able to go through the benefits by now?
09/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes i did
09/10/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*


On the basis of the student's  A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Michelle, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 261 5346: I'm following ma'am
09/10/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 261 5346: I'm following
09/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes
09/10/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 345 5370: Good evening Ms Kirti? How are you? We are doing well thank you.
09/10/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening to you too @263773455370 thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you were able to go through my message above?
09/10/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 345 5370: Yes I did
09/10/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 345 5370: Is it possible to split the registration fee in to three months?
09/10/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 345 5370: More like to pay $200 per month for 3 months
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand. Ideally, a student is supposed to pay their registration fee in one installment so that their admission formalities can be completed in a timely manner. However, with the Endowment plan, we've been able to offer students the provision to split their fees into two parts. These two due dates are significant not only for the convenience of parents but also for securing their scholarship seats. With this, we aim to make managing educational expenses more structured and feasible for parents, and I'm sure you can see the same experience for yourself.
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, we do recognize that unforeseen challenges can arise, making it difficult for some parents to commit to the two-part payment plan. Our primary objective has always been to provide our students with the best opportunities and ensure they have adequate time to manage their financial commitments.
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In cases where parents face unexpected concerns, we take these situations seriously. We work closely with the academic board to explore alternative options, such as extending the payment plan. This might involve dividing the fee into three parts of $200 each over a three-month period.
09/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Rest assured that the academic board genuinely considers such requests, especially when they understand the underlying concerns and the need for flexibility. However, this approval is contingent upon students being transparent with us about their financial challenges and preparations from day one. Only then can such a provision be made to ensure that our students can pursue their higher education dreams without undue financial stress. 

Our goal is to support our students in every way possible, but it's crucial that we have open communication and collaboration from the students themselves. I hope this addresses the query you had?
09/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes it does thank you
09/10/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Please provide the information on it
09/10/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
09/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Please elucidate further here
09/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Meaning if i get better grades like  grade Bs or As i might get more than 50% scholarship credits?
09/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please you are absolutely correct. If a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear here?
09/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes I understand
09/10/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
09/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes
09/10/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Can i ask?
09/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 78 261 5346: How many points are needed for a student to study BALLB in India
09/10/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand. Ideally for a student to pursue a BA. LLB he/she should have a minimum of 2 passes in the A-level subject combination, to be eligible for the course that is a minimum of 2 points or 2 E grades is needed. However, higher points will get you a chance to get a better scholarship quantum.

I hope you are clear here?
09/10/23, 10:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.

13/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Michelle.

I hope you are doing well, I am happy to connect with you again, and move ahead with our discussion may I know if you are ready to proceed?
13/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes please
13/10/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: so may I know if you are ready to discuss these benefits?
14/10/23, 9:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Michelle.

I trust you are doing well. I was looking forward to receiving a response from you yesterday, but unfortunately, I didn't hear back. I did, however, notice that you had the opportunity to review my message. Could you please confirm if we are still connected?
14/10/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 261 5346: Good morning Ms Kirti
14/10/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 261 5346: May we connect at 1230 PM I'll be available
14/10/23, 9:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, alright I shall wait for your response.
14/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Good afternoon Ms Kirti
14/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 261 5346: We may proceed
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes I'm clear with that
14/10/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
14/10/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes I am
14/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Can i ask?
14/10/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Can i pursue a Master's degree after my bachelor's degree under Edoofa Scholarship program
14/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it is certainly possible.
14/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 261 5346: I'm following
14/10/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 261 5346: No i don't have any queries
14/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
14/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes
14/10/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
14/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Noted ma'am
17/10/23, 10:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Michelle,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Ms. Vilsha, and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. We have some incredible news to share with you and your family! 

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application at the universities in India under the Endowment plan.
17/10/23, 10:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With all the efforts we have invested, I am thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, as we received it early, we wanted to share it with you early and get a head start on our discussions. Please take your time to thoroughly review the letter, and then we will discuss its contents in detail.
17/10/23, 10:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the meantime, I would encourage you to note down any queries or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. When we reconnect to discuss this letter, having your questions prepared will help ensure a productive discussion. Once you have taken note of this letter, please let me know so that we can schedule our next discussion accordingly. Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
17/10/23, 11:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 3:54 am - +263 78 261 5346: Good morning Ms Vilsha

This would provide us with ample time to have a detailed conversation and guide you on the next steps you are to undertake to complete your admission formalities.

18/10/23, 10:03 am - Vilsha Edoofa: For now, we will bring our conversation to a close. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
18/10/23, 7:35 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening once again Parents and Michelle,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/10/23, 7:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Good evening Ms Vilsha
18/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes I've gone through the offer letter
18/10/23, 7:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we move forward today, we will delve into the specifics of this particular offer letter. I will provide you with detailed information about the admission process, explain how it was conducted, and guide you through the steps required to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 7:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of questions on your mind will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes please
18/10/23, 7:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 7:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 261 5346: 1. 900 USD
2. 5 years (10 semesters)
3. 300 USD
4. 750 USD
18/10/23, 8:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes
18/10/23, 8:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased that we have been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/10/23, 8:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/10/23, 8:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
19/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Good afternoon Ms Vilsha
19/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 261 5346: My apologies i had network problems yesterday
19/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 261 5346: How can i look for accommodation independently to reduce the cost
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand and that is absolutely alright @263782615346, there is nothing to apologize for since the network challenges can happen to anyone. I am sure with the insights I shared with you, you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and doesn't rush when it comes to accommodation arrangements.
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: They understand the importance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make an informed decision about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As a student, you have both accommodation options (On-campus and Off-campus) available to you. As your admission officer, I can assure you that Off Campus Accommodations are entirely safe. All the accommodations are located within gated communities and have 24-hour CCTV surveillance to ensure security.

If you lean towards off-campus accommodation, we, as a team, will also assist you in finding the right accommodation that suits your preferences. I hope this brings some relief, and this addresses the query you had regarding the accommodation?
19/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes it does thank you
19/10/23, 7:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Michelle. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
20/10/23, 7:45 am - +263 78 261 5346: Good morning Ms Vilsha
20/10/23, 7:46 am - +263 78 261 5346: Yes we can move forward
20/10/23, 8:10 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning to you as well Michelle

It is reassuring to see you following through. Now moving forward with our discussion, please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
20/10/23, 8:10 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
20/10/23, 8:14 am - +263 78 261 5346: Yes we're clear
20/10/23, 8:17 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that Michelle. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you are aware that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/10/23, 8:18 am - +263 78 261 5346: Yes please
20/10/23, 8:28 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/10/23, 8:28 am - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/10/23, 8:36 am - +263 78 261 5346: Is it possible to split the registration fee into 3 installments?
20/10/23, 8:48 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for bringing up this question, Michelle. I will certainly address it and provide you with the necessary clarification. Before I do, could you please share the context or reason behind your inquiry? Is there a specific challenge you're facing that requires a three-part payment plan, or are you seeking this information for general knowledge? Understanding your situation better will help me provide a more tailored response.
20/10/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 261 5346: My mother has a financial situation at the moment...she cannot afford to pay $300 all at once
20/10/23, 10:14 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I see Michelle and thank you for sharing this concern with me. Rest assured, I will certainly help you address the challenge you are facing. However, before we get into the solutions that can be offered, let me provide some context regarding the importance of these due dates and the consequences of missing them.
20/10/23, 10:15 am - Vilsha Edoofa: It's important to understand that universities receive a significant number of applications for scholarships, but they have a limited number of seats available. To ensure fairness to all applicants, universities allow students only one opportunity to reserve their seats with the university. If a student fails to pay the registration fee by the university's specified deadline, the offer letter is revoked, and the student cannot take admission to that particular university for the current academic year. Universities are typically quite strict about these deadlines for registration fees.
20/10/23, 10:17 am - Vilsha Edoofa: To prevent this situation, our primary goal is to keep our students well-informed about financial requirements, thereby encouraging early financial planning. Additionally, we actively engage in conversations with students, as well as their guardians or sponsors, to gain insights into their financial preparations. We are dedicated to providing the necessary assistance to help them plan effectively.
20/10/23, 10:17 am - Vilsha Edoofa: We also understand that unforeseen challenges can occasionally arise, making it difficult for some parents to commit to the two-part payment plan. Our commitment has always been to offer our students the best opportunities and ensure they have ample time to manage their financial commitments.
20/10/23, 10:18 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In cases where parents encounter unexpected concerns, we take these situations seriously. We collaborate closely with the academic board to explore alternative options. One such option involves extending the payment plan, which may entail dividing the fee into three parts, each amounting to $200, distributed over a three-month period. I trust that Ms. Kirit may have discussed this alternative approach with you during your earlier conversation with her?
20/10/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 261 5346: Yes she did
20/10/23, 10:26 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Michelle. Since you mentioned that your parents might face a challenge with the two-month payment plan, and extending the payment plan to three months would help you secure your scholarship seat, I would need some input from your end. This will give me confidence that you will be able to meet the extended payment timelines and help me present a strong case to the academic board to support your request. 

Hence, I hope you will assist me with this information openly and transparently so that I can help you out?
20/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 261 5346: Which information do you need ma'am?
20/10/23, 11:02 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I appreciate your openness in discussing your financial preparations. This information will be instrumental in helping us address your concern effectively and explore alternative options if needed. It is essential to have a clear understanding of your family's financial situation and their ability to adhere to the payment plan. <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 11:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence, to assist you with this concern, I would like to gain a better understanding of the preparations your parents have made for your registration fee. Could you please share the plans in place and how your parents are working to secure the fee? Additionally, do you and your family feel confident in adhering to the following payment plan if it gets approved?

1. $200 before 31st October 2023
2. $200 before 30th November 2023
3. $200 before 31st December 2023. <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 11:05 am - Vilsha Edoofa: If your family is confident about meeting the provided payment plan, it will significantly enhance the chances of approval from the academic board. However, if any challenges or uncertainties arise, please don't hesitate to share them. In such a situation, transparency is crucial as it will enable us to assist you in securing your scholarship seat.
21/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Good evening Ms Vilsha
21/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Noted
21/10/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 261 5346: It's okay...we will share if any challenges or uncertainties arise ahead
26/10/23, 8:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Michelle,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the message you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 8:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 8:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 8:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Good evening Ms Vilsha
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 261 5346: 9:00 am will be fine
26/10/23, 9:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your response @263782615346. I am glad to hear that you will be available tomorrow at 9 am. We look forward to our discussion and will be ready to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. If you have any specific topics or questions you would like to address during our discussion tomorrow, feel free to share them here in your admission group overnight, and we will make sure to cover them tomorrow.

30/10/23, 3:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michelle

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. Please excuse me for not being able to check your message on Saturday, by the time you replied, we were unavailable and hence couldn't attend to your message.
30/10/23, 3:18 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, after our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I wanted to reach out and enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
03/11/23, 1:10 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Michelle,

I would like to extend my appreciation for your patience. I was occupied in a series of meetings with the university officials as we were concluding the admissions for the month of October. Unfortunately, this kept me from being available to connect with you.
03/11/23, 1:12 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that you and your family are in good health. I was able to review your previous message and thank you for sharing the update. I am sorry to hear about your family's loss, and I extend my condolences. It is completely understandable that your mother had to travel for such an important event. We will take this into account, and rest assured, we will work together to find a suitable solution.
03/11/23, 1:12 am - Vilsha Edoofa: To help you with the same, if I may ask, may I know the date on when you are expecting your mother to be back so that we can discuss the next steps for the registration fee and your university admisison? <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 261 5346: Good afternoon Ms Vilsha
03/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 261 5346: I'm expecting my mother to be back by the 13th of November
16/11/23, 8:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Esteemed Parents and Michelle!
I trust you're all doing well.

I'm Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. Now, I was going through your application file and I saw that it's been some time since our last communication. I'm excited to share that starting tomorrow at 08:00 PM CAT, we'll be initiating regular sessions. These sessions are specifically designed to address any queries, concerns, or discussions regarding the ongoing admission journey.

Your active involvement and participation in these sessions are incredibly valuable to ensure a smooth and successful process. We look forward to connecting here tomorrow at the scheduled time to discuss and plan the next steps in this exciting journey. Until then, have a pleasant evening ahead. <This message was edited>

I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Michelle!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Good evening Mr Milan

It's time for us to resume our discussion about the admission process and plan the next steps for your higher education journey. I trust you've been doing well since our last interaction.

May I know if we can continue with our conversation from where we left?
24/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Good afternoon
24/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Yes we may proceed
24/11/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please Michelle. Now, earlier when you had a discussion here with Ms. Vilsha about your admission process, you had mentioned that you need to discuss it with your mother first and she will be back by 13th November, right?
25/11/23, 12:29 am - +263 78 261 5346: Yes
25/11/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/11/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
25/11/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. Now, on that note, I believe your mother would already be back home, and in that case, may I know if you were able to have a discussion with her as of now?
25/11/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 261 5346: Yes i did
25/11/23, 12:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. On that note, how is it that you are planning to complete your admission process please?
25/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Please tell me the options
26/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 261 5346: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 11:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 11:34 am - Milan Edoofa: I sincerely apologize for the delayed response. I was unexpectedly caught up in urgent work that required my immediate attention. I understand that this delay may have caused inconvenience, and I take full responsibility for it.
28/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 261 5346: Good morning Mr Milan 
We are well thank you
28/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 261 5346: Let's hope you're well too!
28/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 261 5346: We utterly understand sir
28/11/23, 11:36 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm doing fine as well, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, when it comes to the options that you are asking for, then I would only be able to help you with that once you will provide me with a proper plan of how do you wish to move ahead with oyur admission process and what have you thought of the same?
28/11/23, 11:39 am - +263 78 261 5346: We plan to pay $200 every monthend till we cover the whole fee
28/11/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, if we consider this month as well, then how do you think you would be able to pay the first part of $200 please?
28/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 261 5346: No sir not considering this month because my mother used most of the money she had on the funeral, hence she can not pay the first part this monthend but she'll be able to complete the first part by the next monthend which is 31 December
29/11/23, 12:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 12:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please. On that note, if you are saying that you cannot manage to pay any part of the registration fee in this month, in that case, I would like to mention that since the university is planning to close the current round of applications tomorrow. 

Moving ahead, if you won't be able to pay some amount towards your registration fee by tomorrow, in that case, you would lose out on the Endowment Plan Benefits as well as the $150 Grant that you had received from our side. On that note, may you please let me know how do you wish to move ahead with that?
29/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Good afternoon Mr Milan  

We are well thank you
29/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 261 5346: We don't have any choice sir because we don't have the money yet
30/11/23, 5:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/11/23, 5:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that you do not have the money with you as of now, however, in that case, don't you think it would be better to work on a solution that suits you instead of letting go of the opportunity?
30/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 345 5370: Good evening Mr Milan
30/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 345 5370: I first would like to apologize for not honouring our agreement due to circumstances beyond my control. 

What's the solution that you were suggesting we use.
01/12/23, 12:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Michelle!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/12/23, 12:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please. Moving ahead, before we discuss about the solution can you please help me in understanding more about your preparation for completing the admission. How are you planning to do that?
01/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 345 5370: Good afternoon Mr Milan
01/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 345 5370: We were planning to start our 1st payment December monthend
01/12/23, 12:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please. About that, how are you preparing for the same?
