I am really glad for you to consider our child's application and picking him amongst a lot of applicants. I would like to know if it is possible for the evaluation to go ahead without the child presents, he is at a boarding school and will only be available when schools close on 1 December.
21/11/23, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: Well received please!

We shall thoroughly discuss everything and the parents only can participate since child is at school currently.
21/11/23, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21/11/23, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years.

22/11/23, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
22/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 238 3967: Morning  to you,  we are fine thank you
22/11/23, 9:13 am - +27 84 562 0537: Good morning panel, I am good. You may go ahead.
22/11/23, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Wonderful!

So now as we proceed ahead, I would like to know Chimombe better as a student!

How he is at school, his interests and hobbies and what exactly would he like to study.
22/11/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 238 3967: Tauya is a hard working boy  and brilliant in his studies, good behaviour both at school and at home. Right now he is a choir master at his school and  he was given roles to do at school e.g head of health department and also president of their Anglican religion. Tauya also plays volleyball at school.
22/11/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 238 3967: Tauya likes singing, he likes to study biomedical engineering
22/11/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: Oh that's wonderful, Mrs Elizabeth!

It's a pleasure to know more about him and his interests.

Is his first name Tauya or Chimombe please?
22/11/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak changed the group name from "Chimombe_DM02(21/11)HP" to "Tauya_DM02(21/11)HP"
22/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 238 3967: His first names is Tauya Desire
22/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 238 3967: So it's Tauya D.
22/11/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please
22/11/23, 9:57 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
22/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 238 3967: Yes l'm confident that he will aim higher
22/11/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Wonderful
22/11/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Can you please share his subject combination at A level?
22/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 238 3967: Mathematics, biology and geography
22/11/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Oh alright,

You mentioned his interests in Biomedical engineering, so Mrs Elizabeth, did you or Tauya ever happen to research about the requirements for Engineering please?
22/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 238 3967: Yes we did research. Tauya wanted to do medicine but because of his combination we thought this was   better
22/11/23, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please!

You see Mrs Elizabeth, to pursue Engineering Physics is an important requirement please.
22/11/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 238 3967: Okay
22/11/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 238 3967: So with his combination what is the best career we can get
22/11/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are-

1. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

5. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
22/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 238 3967: Okay. So I think he has to choose among those
22/11/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: That's completely alright, Mrs Elizabeth.
22/11/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: May I know which course would you like to know about as of now?
22/11/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 238 3967: I would like to know more about number 3 and 2.
22/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 238 3967: The challenge is how demanding are the jobs
22/11/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is an undergraduate Medical Lab Technology program which is a 3 years course. Medical Laboratory Technology program also called Clinical laboratory science is an allied health profession that is concerned with the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of disease through the use of clinical laboratory tests. During the program these tests help candidates to learn and diagnose, detect and treat diseases. Additionally the program deals with the collecting of information's sampling, reporting, testing and documentation.


Such graduates are hired in capacities such as Laboratory Technician, Laboratory Manager, Medical Officer, Research Associate, Medical Record Technician, Resident Medical Officer, Lab Assistant, Laboratory Testing Manager, Associate Professor/Lecturer etc.

Medical technicians can get job opportunities in places such as hospitals, health care clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists’ offices, etc.
22/11/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: *A Bachelor in Medical Laboratory Technology student could work in the field of forensic medicine as a forensic laboratory technician, performing tasks such as analyzing samples and testing specimens to assist in criminal investigations and trials. However, they may need to obtain additional training and certification specific to forensic science. Additionally, the specific job responsibilities and requirements may vary depending on the laboratory and jurisdiction.*
22/11/23, 10:35 am - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

A Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology prepares individuals to work in medical laboratories, where they perform a variety of tests to analyze biological samples and support the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Graduates with this degree can pursue careers in the healthcare and medical field, including:

Medical Laboratory Technologist
Medical Laboratory Technician
Clinical Laboratory Scientist
Quality Control Specialist
Biomedical Technologist
Biotech Research Scientist

In these roles, individuals with a Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology may be involved in performing laboratory tests to detect the presence of diseases, analyzing and interpreting test results, and working with healthcare professionals to develop and implement effective treatments. These professionals play a critical role in supporting the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease, and their work is essential to the effective functioning of healthcare organizations.
22/11/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: *B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.
22/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 238 3967: I think some of his interest s are linked In number 3. But  we as a family will   discuss this with him and he will make his  decision
22/11/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 238 3967: But we as parents number 3 is the best
22/11/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: That's completely alright and you can surely discuss as a family and share any queries you might have.

So far shall we proceed with the remaining discussion?
22/11/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that.
22/11/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 238 3967: Yes we can proceed
22/11/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful please!

I appreciate your efforts.
22/11/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
22/11/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 238 3967: Yes you are right

22/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 238 3967: Ooh wonderfull
22/11/23, 11:02 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Mrs Elizabeth.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
22/11/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 238 3967: We're not familiar with the cost. I was about to ask u about if   he succeed are there any cost to be met by parents
22/11/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Sure please.
22/11/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 238 3967: So it means 2000 to3000 is for the parents. Am I right
22/11/23, 11:18 am - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Elizabeth, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if he is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, he would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
22/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 238 3967: Ooh I undestood
22/11/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Now do you have any queries, Mrs Elizabeth?
22/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 238 3967: Another question! what about travelling  expenses
22/11/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: You would be briefed regarding the same later in the process please.
22/11/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
22/11/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 238 3967: You explained it very well. I now understand the difference
22/11/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: I am glad please.
22/11/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Mrs Elizabeth, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
22/11/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 238 3967: Yes like right now it can range to that amount
22/11/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: Indeed,

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mrs Elizabeth?
22/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 238 3967: Yes indeed it's affordable
22/11/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
22/11/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/11/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

22/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 238 3967: Nice program
22/11/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
22/11/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/11/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 238 3967: I like this program besides the credit the child will be occupied with something to do than misbehaving in his free time
22/11/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: That's very correct, Mrs Elizabeth.
22/11/23, 11:53 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/11/23, 11:59 am - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Mrs Elizabeth, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes only. 

Are you ready?
22/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 238 3967: Yes I'm ready
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Elizabeth, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 238 3967: If its 300 it will be 1500 dollars
22/11/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/11/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/11/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mrs Elizabeth, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
22/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 238 3967: Yes l do
22/11/23, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/11/23, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
22/11/23, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 238 3967: Okay
22/11/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/11/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
22/11/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 238 3967: Understood
22/11/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/11/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
22/11/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
22/11/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 238 3967: Okay
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 238 3967: Yea I did  have a conversation with Mrs Magwaza she gave me assurance that we don't have to fear and you will guide us through the whole process
22/11/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: I am glad
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

I would like to inform you that *tomorrow, at 12:30 PM CAT Mr. Sahil would also be conducting your eligibility check interview* wherein he would be sharing the entire evaluation of your application, interviewing your family members, and sharing the eligibility check test with you as a part of Stage 2. He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.

23/11/23, 12:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
23/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 238 3967: Morning to you too. For sure we have been enlightened in stage one.

23/11/23, 12:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
23/11/23, 12:45 pm - +27 84 562 0537: Good afternoon team.

Ms Harmehak presided over yesterday's session very well and I learnt a lot from the discussion
23/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 238 3967: Yes. She is a challenge to us. She motivated us and gave us assurance that everything will be okay
23/11/23, 12:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you aware that your school is Edoofa associated school and we have many students from your school who already are part of this program ?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

23/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 238 3967: But  question number 3. As   discussed in stage one it is said to be 6000 - 8000 without scholarship. But we can afford less
23/11/23, 2:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: If your application get shortlisted for higher quantum of scholarship then cost will drop down to $1200-$1800 .
23/11/23, 2:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So are you ready for the same ?
23/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 238 3967: Yes we are ready
23/11/23, 2:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
23/11/23, 2:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

23/11/23, 2:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
23/11/23, 2:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 28th or 29th November 2023 for $200 and the 28th or 29th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 28th or 29th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
23/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 238 3967: I will prefer number 1. 200 on the 29th and the remaining on the 28th of December
