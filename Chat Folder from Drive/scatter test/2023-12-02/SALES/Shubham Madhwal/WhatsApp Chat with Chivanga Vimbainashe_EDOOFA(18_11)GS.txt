I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same! <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Yes I am Chivanga Vimbainashe
18/11/23, 1:07 pm - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Chivanga,

You can address me as Mr Singh, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Okay nice to meet you Mr Singh
18/11/23, 1:16 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Chivanga, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Persistance, is that correct?
18/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Yes you are correct
18/11/23, 1:17 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Persistance, also do tell me whether you learnt about Persistance’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
18/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 908 8738: I learnt that Edoofa program helps students to finish their studies abroad
18/11/23, 1:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This message was deleted
18/11/23, 1:22 pm - Sagar: So let me brief you about the Edoofa program.
18/11/23, 1:22 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18/11/23, 1:22 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/11/23, 1:23 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 150 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
18/11/23, 1:23 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
18/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 908 8738: It also helps students with scholarships which are very helpful
18/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 908 8738: And its main aim is to change the lives of people through education
18/11/23, 1:24 pm - Sagar: Right
18/11/23, 1:25 pm - Sagar: So do you agree?
18/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Yes I am looking for a scholarship so that I can fulfil my dreams and make my parents proud
18/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Yes I agree with you
18/11/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: Great, so Chivanga, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
18/11/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
18/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Oky thank you
18/11/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 908 8738: My parents aren't online
18/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 908 8738: So what can I do l really need your help
18/11/23, 1:37 pm - Sagar: Well Chivanga, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *on Monday again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

21/11/23, 1:48 pm - Sagar: Hi Chivanga, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
21/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 908 8738: No l want to be the first

22/11/23, 12:48 pm - Sagar: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters. 

A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.

22/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Next year January
22/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 908 8738: I am waiting for the results to come out
22/11/23, 12:58 pm - Sagar: Noted.
22/11/23, 12:58 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
22/11/23, 12:59 pm - Sagar: So do you think you can meet the criteria?
22/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Yes I can meet the criteria
22/11/23, 1:02 pm - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the course?
22/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Yes sir
22/11/23, 1:05 pm - Sagar: Apologies meant to ask did you understand the course?
22/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Yes l did
22/11/23, 1:07 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 908 8738: If l choose this career l see myself as someone who can stand on myself. Being self dependent is also my desire. Choosing this career will help me to fulfill all my dreams. Being in Edoofa will also help my mother to reduce her burden of paying my fees and this will help me to go further with my studies. In the next 5 years l would like to take care of my siblings and to also help my fellow mates to achieve their goals too. I would also like to help the organisation with some funds so that it can also help other vulnerable people like me
22/11/23, 1:18 pm - Sagar: That is really great Chivanga I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
22/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Being considered by Edoofa will also help me to be someone who is hardworking. I promise to plough back if l get the scholarship
22/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Yes I am willing to do everything
22/11/23, 1:21 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Studying abroad was my dream since I was a kid. So I only want to fulfill my dreams
22/11/23, 1:26 pm - Sagar: That is great, Chivanga.
22/11/23, 1:26 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
22/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Yes sir I would like to know why Edoofa recommends India
22/11/23, 1:36 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
22/11/23, 1:36 pm - Sagar: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

22/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Ohh oky
22/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Thank you so much
22/11/23, 1:40 pm - Sagar: So now Chivanga, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
22/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Oky
22/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 908 8738: So after l finished my career will Edoofa help me to look for a job
22/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sagar: The university holds a campus drive every year for last year's students, in which different companies come to hire students, with the help of the EWYL program the student learns skills that are essential for future jobs, which helps our student to secure a job.
22/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Oky that's great
22/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
22/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 908 8738: No we are not
22/11/23, 1:58 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
22/11/23, 1:58 pm - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 1:58 pm - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 1:58 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 1:59 pm - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Okay that's so nice of the Edoofa
22/11/23, 2:12 pm - Sagar: This message was deleted
22/11/23, 2:12 pm - Sagar: In simple words Chivanga what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 908 8738: This is great sir thank you
22/11/23, 4:56 pm - Sagar: Well Chivanga, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care, and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
22/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Thank you sir
23/11/23, 8:19 am - Sagar: Greetings Everyone,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
23/11/23, 8:23 am - +263 78 908 8738: Good morning sir
23/11/23, 8:25 am - Sagar: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/11/23, 8:26 am - +263 78 908 8738: Yes sir
23/11/23, 9:28 am - Sagar: Chivanga, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/11/23, 9:28 am - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
23/11/23, 9:29 am - Sagar: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/11/23, 9:29 am - Sagar: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 908 8738: Oky l understand
23/11/23, 9:56 am - Sagar: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
23/11/23, 9:56 am - Sagar: *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

23/11/23, 9:56 am - Sagar: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis

23/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 78 908 8738: This is interesting so the EWYL helps a lot
23/11/23, 10:02 am - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
23/11/23, 10:02 am - Sagar: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/11/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 908 8738: Yes this will benefit me
23/11/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: I am delighted to hear that Chivanga, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 908 8738: Oky l understand
23/11/23, 10:33 am - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/11/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 908 8738: Yeah this is what I have been looking for
23/11/23, 10:40 am - Sagar: Chivanga, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
23/11/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 908 8738: Yes l understand everything
23/11/23, 10:41 am - Sagar: Alright Chivanga, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 908 8738: Yes but you know being in a family that is not functioning properly it is difficult
23/11/23, 10:51 am - Sagar: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 908 8738: Yes I did and they are supporting me in this
23/11/23, 10:54 am - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 908 8738: Yes I am
23/11/23, 1:47 pm - Sagar: Chivanga as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 908 8738: $1500-$2250
23/11/23, 2:05 pm - Sagar: Exactly Chivanga, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 2:06 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Wow thank you for the adjustment
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - Sagar: Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Yea this is good
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/11/23, 2:10 pm - Sagar: Chivanga basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
23/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Oky sir
23/11/23, 2:10 pm - Sagar: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out)
23/11/23, 2:10 pm - Sagar: *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
23/11/23, 2:10 pm - Sagar: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
23/11/23, 2:11 pm - Sagar: However Chivanga, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Oky sir
23/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sagar: Yes Chivanga and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
23/11/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: And do remember to discuss this part with your family.
23/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Oky sir
23/11/23, 2:16 pm - Sagar: Please address this.
23/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Yes I understand
23/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sagar: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
23/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 908 8738: No my you please help me with that
23/11/23, 3:28 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:28 pm - Sagar: Alright Chivanga, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.
23/11/23, 3:28 pm - Sagar: Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.
23/11/23, 3:28 pm - Sagar: The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.
23/11/23, 3:28 pm - Sagar: The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
23/11/23, 3:28 pm - Sagar: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.
23/11/23, 3:29 pm - Sagar: Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.
23/11/23, 3:29 pm - Sagar: Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
23/11/23, 3:29 pm - Sagar: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
23/11/23, 4:45 pm - Sagar: Well Chivanga, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 908 8738: Thank you sir
24/11/23, 8:30 am - Sagar: Greetings Everyone,

*"All our dreams can come true; if we have the courage to pursue them."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
24/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 908 8738: Good morning sir
24/11/23, 8:32 am - Sagar: So let us continue our session.
24/11/23, 8:33 am - Sagar: Please address this.
24/11/23, 8:33 am - +263 78 908 8738: Oky sir
24/11/23, 8:33 am - +263 78 908 8738: Yes sir
24/11/23, 8:41 am - Sagar: Chivanga, we are close to the end of the counselling session so can you stay active for 10 mins?
24/11/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 908 8738: Oky sir
24/11/23, 8:50 am - Sagar: So please answer the question.
24/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 908 8738: Yes I now understand let's proceed
24/11/23, 8:53 am - Sagar: Also I would like to add, As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
24/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 908 8738: This is great sir thanks for considering our parents
24/11/23, 8:56 am - Sagar: Now Chivanga, In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
24/11/23, 8:57 am - Sagar: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
24/11/23, 8:59 am - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
24/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 908 8738: Oky sir
24/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 908 8738: Thank you so much Mr Singh
24/11/23, 9:00 am - Sagar: Please address this.
