01/12/23, 12:31 pm - Arshita: Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of biotechnology?
01/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 233 3752: I don't have
01/12/23, 12:41 pm - Arshita: That is fine. 

To take your evaluation forward can you please share your O level and A level results? 

Pictures will be better
01/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 233 3752: A level results are not yet out
01/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 233 3752: O level is it possible if l sent later the picture because l am not home at the moment
01/12/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: That is well noted.
01/12/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Its okay,noted
01/12/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
01/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 233 3752: No I didnt research
No i didnt apply
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
01/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Im done
01/12/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: Can you please confirm me your subjects in A level ?
01/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Pure Maths 
Biology 
Crop science
01/12/23, 2:38 pm - Arshita: With your interest in engineering why didn't you opt for engineering at A level?
01/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 233 3752: My school didnt offer it
01/12/23, 2:59 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
01/12/23, 2:59 pm - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - Arshita: Since you do not have physics , you are not eligible for engineering. 

At the same time do you have any alternate career aspirations?
01/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 233 3752: This message was deleted
01/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 233 3752: No 
But do you have any suggestions
01/12/23, 3:19 pm - Arshita: May I know is there any particular field that you are interested?
01/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Biology
01/12/23, 3:34 pm - Arshita: That is well noted.
01/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Okay
01/12/23, 3:36 pm - Arshita: Since you are not having Physics and Chemistry, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest there are better courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfil your dreams of working in this field

*Physiotherapy*

*Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

01/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Working on my career as a physiotherapist as I would have completed my studies with your help
01/12/23, 4:36 pm - Arshita: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career.I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.
 
So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
01/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 233 3752: The system has four levels lower primary upper primary and high to higher secondary  
The best education in india is Kerala
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your knowledge
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.
01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

01/12/23, 4:44 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 233 3752: Okay
01/12/23, 4:49 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
01/12/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 233 3752: I believe studying in Indian will help me have a career I can never have in Zimbabwe
01/12/23, 4:56 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
01/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 233 3752: No I am not familiar
01/12/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/12/23, 5:04 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 5:04 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
01/12/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 233 3752: It isnt affordable
01/12/23, 5:13 pm - Arshita: I can understand that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
01/12/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 233 3752: No I do not
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
