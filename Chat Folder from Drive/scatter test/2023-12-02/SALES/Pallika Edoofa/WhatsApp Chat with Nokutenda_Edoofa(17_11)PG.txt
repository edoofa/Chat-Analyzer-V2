24/11/23, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*


Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

28/11/23, 5:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
28/11/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 302 3041: No I didn't
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/11/23, 6:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Nokutenda, as you have mentioned your interest Engineering so , why haven't you opted for physics or chemistry?
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 71 302 3041: At our school were don't ahave those subjects teachers
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Nokutenda!!
28/11/23, 6:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
28/11/23, 6:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, please let me know your alternate career options?
28/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 71 302 3041: I will rather choose markerting

28/11/23, 7:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/11/23, 7:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 7:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*

So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
28/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 71 302 3041: As per my view I thought this typical scholarship it just offers you your fees without any cost
28/11/23, 8:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: No, Nokutenda, Kindly excuse for the delay as I was having dinner, so, Please Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the

29/11/23, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
29/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 302 3041: Ok
