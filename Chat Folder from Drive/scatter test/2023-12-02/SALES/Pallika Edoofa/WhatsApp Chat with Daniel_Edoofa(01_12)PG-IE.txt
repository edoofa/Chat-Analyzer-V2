01/12/23, 5:31 pm - +263 78 735 0100: Oky thank you
01/12/23, 5:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Daniel, I would like to know What specific financial plans or strategies have you and your parents put in place to support your tertiary education abroad?
01/12/23, 5:51 pm - +263 78 735 0100: We don't have any specific plans yet
01/12/23, 5:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Daniel,Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
01/12/23, 5:57 pm - +263 78 735 0100: For the expenses remaining they are able to manage because they are working
01/12/23, 5:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!

01/12/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 735 0100: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 6:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Please share the subject combination of your A level.
01/12/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 735 0100: Maths Physics Chemistry
01/12/23, 6:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
01/12/23, 6:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
01/12/23, 6:28 pm - +263 78 735 0100: Yes l searched about the University of Oxford in America which is ranked the best University
01/12/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 735 0100: But a lot of qualifications is needed so that you will accepted
01/12/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 735 0100: But l also get information about studying in the country where this program is based
01/12/23, 6:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 735 0100: Oky thank you
01/12/23, 6:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Dean, proceeding further, I would like to know that if you want to pursue Medicine, so why haven't you opted Biology in your A level?
01/12/23, 6:40 pm - +263 78 735 0100: This message was deleted
01/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 735 0100: through further investigation l found that the key subject is Chemistry. Chemistry is the subject that only combine all science subjects. But is mainly based to medical sciences
01/12/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 735 0100: Medical sciences have many departments were Chemistry is essentially needed.The only way to have access is to pass Chemistry with a distinction that is what l'm going to do.
01/12/23, 7:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Daniel, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
01/12/23, 7:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Biology, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*
