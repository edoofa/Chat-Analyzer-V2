01/12/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Good afternoon Sir
I'm sorry for replying late there was a problem with the network
01/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 635 0533: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I'm sorry to report that I didn't pass , I'm disappointed in myself, but I'm committed to working hard to improve my grades. I understand that this may affect my scholarship, but I'm willing to discuss this further, if needed.
01/12/23, 6:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
01/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes Sir I'm confident

I will do my best to pass.
01/12/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I want to assure you that I'm committed to learning from my mistakes and improving my performance in the future.
01/12/23, 6:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe you will ace your exams with flying colours, Shalom!
01/12/23, 6:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
01/12/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I really appreciate your belief in me
01/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I've always had a passion for engineering, and I'm interested in pursuing a career in this field. 
I've always been fascinated by the way that engineers use science and technology to solve problems.
01/12/23, 7:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since engineering encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues you?
01/12/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Civil engineering 

because it is a fascinating field that involves designing and constructing the infrastructure that keeps our world running for example bridges, roads, and buildings
01/12/23, 9:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew you towards that peculiar domain, please?
