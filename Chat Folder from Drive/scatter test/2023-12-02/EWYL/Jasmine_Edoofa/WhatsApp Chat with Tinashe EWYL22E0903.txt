25/10/23, 10:51 pm - +263 78 183 6495: Question 2 

*What do you understand from Project 1?*

Firstly, I have understood that Edoofians will represent Edoofa to build a network of partnership with Organisations/companies and potential employers. This will help Edoofians create a strong professional network and earn scholarship credits. Secondly, Edoofians will identify organisations/companies in their countries and regions on internet and provide mobile applications. Thirdly, Edoofians will also identify decision-makers who work in these organisations and reach out to them via LinkedIn which is the most effective tool to find professionals and the companies they are working with. Fourthly, Edoofians will also share Edoofa's message with their connections. Also, Edoofians will arrange for a meeting/video call with Edoofa and signing the contract through email. After all is done, we will create a Google sheet to record the progress of our project in order to report through tha entire activity and we will be earning scholarship credits.
26/10/23, 3:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I will see you tomorrow for the session at 8:30 am. Till then Take Care
28/10/23, 8:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning,

28/10/23, 8:25 am - +263 78 183 6495: I'm blessed today and you
28/10/23, 8:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
28/10/23, 8:28 am - +263 78 183 6495: You are welcome @918982519022
28/10/23, 8:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yesterday, we were discussing about Project 2. Do you remember?
28/10/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 183 6495: Yes I do remember
28/10/23, 8:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
28/10/23, 8:32 am - +263 78 183 6495: You can go ahead
28/10/23, 8:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
28/10/23, 8:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/10/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 183 6495: Ok I thank you @918982519022
28/10/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 183 6495: I have understood the most effective through which I can execute at project 2. I have to create a WhatsApp group and identify the right students who can be part of my group. The goal is to reach out large number of students and provide the necessary information about Edoofa before counselling sessions and showing they were prepared and have a smooth counselling experience. To find the right students I can start by getting in touch by my schoolmates who have completed their senior secondary school and students who are currently in form 5 and 6. The main reason of creating this group is to reach a larger audience by using less energy.
28/10/23, 9:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Tinashe, I am impressed with your understanding.
28/10/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
28/10/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 183 6495: So what if the student forgot, will I earn credits
28/10/23, 9:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, But I will train you on how you have to communicate with the student so that he/she doesn't forget
28/10/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 183 6495: That's my mentor, I do like and appreciate it
28/10/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 183 6495: Thank you @918982519022
28/10/23, 9:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

28/10/23, 9:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know is this project clear?
28/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 183 6495: What name should I give to the group I am going to create
28/10/23, 10:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The choice is in your hands, Tinahse. You're free to exercise your creativity. Here are a few examples for inspiration: "Edoofa Scholarship Program - Tinahse," "The Path to Success," and so on.
28/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 183 6495: Thank you so much @918982519022
28/10/23, 10:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Welcome, Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
28/10/23, 10:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 183 6495: Alright
28/10/23, 10:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
28/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 183 6495: I'm now listening to it
28/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 183 6495: Project 3 is a favourite among others as it provides an opportunity to make student's future proud by informing them about the fortunate qualification for the Edoofa Program. In this task I have to reach out to local higher secondary schools in my region and connect with the principals to introduce them to the Edoofa programme. I begin by creating a list of higher secondary schools in my area and start with my own school and connect with the principal. I can reach out to them via WhatsApp, phone call and share why I joined Edoofa in the first place. Afterwards I have to ask if they are interested in setting up an online meeting with the Edoofa program director to explore potential collaborations. I have to share the contact details with my EWYL mentor using the format provided to me. The goal of this project is to arrange a meeting with the school principal and the Edoofa Program director to assist me in initiating the conversation with my principal.
31/10/23, 7:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now it is time to wrap up for the day. We will continue our session tomorrow at the same time, which is 8:30 AM.
Goodnight!
31/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 183 6495: Same to you
01/11/23, 8:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Morning Tinashe_*
"Happy new month! May this month bring you new beginnings, new adventures, and new opportunities. Let's make it a month to remember."

*_This is to remind you that you have your session today from 8:30 am_* 
Are you ready?
01/11/23, 8:20 am - +263 78 183 6495: Thank you @918982519022
01/11/23, 8:20 am - +263 78 183 6495: Morning
01/11/23, 8:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Are you ready for the session?
01/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 183 6495: Yes
01/11/23, 8:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time, we were discussing Project 3. Do you remember?
01/11/23, 8:39 am - +263 78 183 6495: Yes I do remember
01/11/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
01/11/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 183 6495: Why so
01/11/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
01/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 183 6495: Alright, I have a question on that one
01/11/23, 8:51 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead
01/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 183 6495: My question is what if there is none who will be able to pay that $2000 ,will they earn Edoofa scholarship
01/11/23, 9:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In the context of the Edoofa scholarship program, it's important to note that it's a partially funded program, and students are required to cover certain expenses. 

However, what sets the Edoofa scholarship program apart from others is that it offers the opportunity to obtain a degree at a cost ranging from $2,000 to $3,000. Moreover, there exists the possibility of securing a 100% scholarship, but this is contingent upon a comprehensive evaluation of your academic performance and extracurricular activities.
01/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 183 6495: I understand
01/11/23, 9:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Tinashe- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
01/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 183 6495: Alright
01/11/23, 9:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we are ready to begin our new journey
Please note a few things:

02/11/23, 12:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening,* ☺️

15/11/23, 8:18 am - +263 78 183 6495: How are you @918982519022

15/11/23, 8:20 am - +263 78 183 6495: Ok I understand
15/11/23, 8:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 8:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
15/11/23, 8:25 am - +263 78 183 6495: I am a proud Edoofian
15/11/23, 8:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now you can text on the Line and I will get back to you there in a while.
15/11/23, 8:26 am - +263 78 183 6495: Thank you @918982519022
