01/12/23, 8:30 am - Sharda Edoofa: *"Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start." - Nido Qubein*

This profound quote encourages us to see our current situation as a starting point, not a limitation. It emphasizes the limitless potential for growth, learning, and transformation, regardless of our current circumstances.

Before we delve into our session's agenda, I'd love to hear how you're doing. Your well-being is important, and I'm here to support you on your journey.

01/12/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: *PROJECT 1: CORPORATE ALLIANCE*
01/12/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
01/12/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 129 8755: okay its fine Ms Shadra
01/12/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: ery quickly  summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
01/12/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 129 8755: i have low network so its still downloadingand mighty take a while
01/12/23, 8:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: In this case, you can go through the audio after our session, I do not want to spend more time on this. Instead let me share the written information. We are anyway lagging behind our other peers who have already started to work on the projects.
01/12/23, 8:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: I hope you have had the chance to review the EWYL document shared by the counselor, which outlines the projects you will be undertaking as part of the program. Today, I will provide detailed explanations of each project, starting with the first one: corporate alliance. The objective of this project is to gain an understanding of the market you plan to enter in the future and begin preparing for it at an early stage.

Given the global pandemic and the shift towards online work, there is a great opportunity to connect with technologically-driven and digital companies. Your task is to identify such companies within your country or region. To accomplish this, I suggest starting with your immediate network—family members, neighbors, or parents of your friends—who work in the service sector. Share your objectives and explain how Edoofa is helping you develop the necessary skills for future employability after graduation.

Additionally, I recommend creating a LinkedIn account, which is a professional networking platform. It allows you to search for companies and connect with their employees. Download the LinkedIn app from the Play Store, and I will guide you in creating your account. Through LinkedIn, reach out to managers, heads of organizations, and human resource managers, initiating conversations and gathering their contact information to set up meetings with Edoofa.

Please share the meeting details with our team, enabling us to effectively communicate and discuss the business aspects of this corporate alliance. I will provide you with a document that addresses common questions, such as the types of companies to target and how to initiate conversations with influential individuals.

Creating a LinkedIn account will expand your professional network, enhance your credibility, and increase your chances of securing internships, gaining industrial exposure, or even finding job opportunities within your country. By directly contributing to your growth and that of your country, your work will generate a significant and lasting impact.

Please feel free to ask any further questions or seek assistance along the way. Together, we can make a difference.

01/12/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
01/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 129 8755: network is still a problem can we move an i share the understanding later
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Sure Tadiwanshe.
Let me share the written information about this project.
01/12/23, 3:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: All the Edoofians have a great sense of community building. The term community building refers to the process of establishing and strengthening connections, relationships, and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community. This involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate, communicate and work toward common goals. The goal of community building is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction, and participation in a shared sense of responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success.

 This shared belief is the core of our second project which is community building. The primary outcome of this project is for students to develop networking and persuasion skills and learn how to leverage social media to offer African students an opportunity to join Edoufian's educational ecosystem and acquire international education that prepares them for the future. By reaching out to personal and extended networks, students will identify motivated youths who are looking to create great careers and direct them toward this opportunity.

 This project also encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to create an impact in the lives of others. To successfully complete this project, students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools, completed their secondary education, or are currently in the final year of senior secondary education. As a member of Team EDUFA, students will be expected to use their networking and persuasion skills to refer the students to the program and help the organization grow.

 Throughout the project, Edoofa will provide guidance and support to ensure that the students are successful in their efforts. The referral generation project for Edoofa provides students with the opportunity to earn scholarship credits by referring their personal and extended networks to the Edoofa program. For every student that enrolls and pays the first part of the enrollment fee, the referring student will receive $20 worth of scholarship credits. Upon completion of the admission formalities of the university,

The referring student will receive $30 worth of scholarship credits. In addition, there is an opportunity to earn an extra $5 worth of scholarship credits for every student that the Edoofa team connects with the referring student for clarification on the program.
