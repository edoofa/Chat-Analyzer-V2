01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: PROJECT 1: CORPORATE ALLIANCE
01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

01/12/23, 2:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: very quickly summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.

I want to understand it all.

the pressure is too much
01/12/23, 2:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Where does the problem lie Sandile? You have not even started to work on the projects.
01/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 019 2995: l am hardly available these days for the sessions we have to do and that's where l see that l cannot handle all the pressure that l have 

basically l feel that it is better to quit the scholarship program
01/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed and considering quitting the scholarship program due to the pressure and limited availability. Remember, challenges are a natural part of growth, and it's okay to feel stretched at times. Here's a simple yet powerful perspective:
01/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Embrace Challenges: "The only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible." – Charles Kingsleigh*

Challenges are stepping stones to success. Instead of seeing them as obstacles, view them as opportunities to learn and grow. You have the potential to overcome difficulties and emerge stronger.
01/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Time Management: "You may delay, but time will not." – Benjamin Franklin*

Consider reassessing your schedule and priorities. Efficient time management can help you balance your commitments and responsibilities effectively. Break tasks into smaller, manageable chunks to make the workload more manageable.
01/12/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Seek Support: "Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much." – Helen Keller*

Don't hesitate to ask for help. Reach out to me, or family members. They can provide guidance, support, and valuable insights to help you navigate challenges.
01/12/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Persistence: "It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer." – Albert Einstein*

Perseverance is key. Understand that challenges are temporary, and your persistence will lead to achievements. Take one step at a time, and you'll find yourself making progress.
01/12/23, 2:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Reflect on Goals: "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." – Eleanor Roosevelt*

Reflect on your goals and aspirations. Consider whether the scholarship aligns with your long-term objectives. Sometimes, short-term challenges can be overcome for the sake of a greater goal.
01/12/23, 2:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Choices and Growth: "You are the choices you make." – Seneca*

Every choice you make shapes your future. Evaluate the decision to quit the scholarship program carefully. Consider how it aligns with your goals and how it contributes to your personal growth.
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 019 2995: l hear you ma'am
may l kindly ask for time to sit down with my parents and reflect on these challenges l am facing
01/12/23, 3:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Sure Sandile.
01/12/23, 3:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now the scheduled time for our session is over.
01/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 019 2995: ok ok
