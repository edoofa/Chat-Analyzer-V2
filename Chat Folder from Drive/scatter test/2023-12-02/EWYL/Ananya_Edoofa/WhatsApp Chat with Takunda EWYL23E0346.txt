13/07/23, 9:48 am - You were added
08/08/23, 2:24 pm - Luminous Advertisements: I am doing well
08/08/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, has your winter vacation started?
08/08/23, 4:39 pm - Luminous Advertisements: Coming through in regards to the EWYL program, I had shared that I would be available from the 8th.
10/08/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🛩️
10/08/23, 8:37 am - Luminous Advertisements: Good morning Mentor
10/08/23, 8:37 am - Luminous Advertisements: I am ready for thé session
10/08/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
10/08/23, 8:51 am - Luminous Advertisements: No I do not please could you relay them to me
10/08/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
10/08/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
10/08/23, 8:55 am - Luminous Advertisements: I understand
10/08/23, 8:55 am - Luminous Advertisements: Thank you for that reiteration
10/08/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
10/08/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/08/23, 8:57 am - Luminous Advertisements: This is great
10/08/23, 8:57 am - Luminous Advertisements: I have read
10/08/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
10/08/23, 9:05 am - Luminous Advertisements: Nice to meet you 🙏🙏
10/08/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
10/08/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/08/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, my proud Edoofian!

14/08/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
14/08/23, 10:17 pm - Luminous Advertisements: The questions section was my favorite
15/08/23, 8:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

I wanted to inform you that we won't be able to connect for our session today, as we are celebrating our *77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
16/08/23, 2:08 pm - Luminous Advertisements: Sounds great
16/08/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

Then the third and final goal is that we work towards attaining the objective of me learning and evolving with the relevant 21st century skills to prepare me for the real world workplace and helping me grow holistically
16/08/23, 2:23 pm - Luminous Advertisements: Newsletter
16/08/23, 2:25 pm - Luminous Advertisements: The Hall of inspiration is a part of the newsletter that aims to encourage and inspire edoofians taking up the EWYL Program, through stories of other Edoofians who have achieved success and achieved or learnt something from the program, not to mention gaining a certificate and achievements from projects

21/08/23, 8:53 am - Luminous Advertisements: I am ready for todays session
21/08/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if you were able to read the document?

21/08/23, 9:03 am - Luminous Advertisements: Thank you very much, let me share that.
21/08/23, 9:08 am - Luminous Advertisements: My understanding of the document is broken down into three main parts 

The first one is the extensive explanation and eye opening, outlook on the program’s intent on helping us know, learn and use the skills of the future, 

This means understanding the current job market we now live in which is highly digitized and hence there are many skills that need to be learnt in order for us to not lose our jobs like others have to the changing environment, 

It also marries this with the vision to also keep us in line with skills that are non changing that machines can’t do, an example is negotiation etc,
21/08/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good job, Takunda!🌟
21/08/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
21/08/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 9:11 am - Luminous Advertisements: Thank you very much
21/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
21/08/23, 9:18 am - Luminous Advertisements: Apologies I am still listening to the audio
21/08/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: ALright.
21/08/23, 9:24 am - Luminous Advertisements: What I learned is that I will be learning how to reach out to the prospective organizations that I want to partner with edoofa through linked in to be able to start working and earning scholarship credits
21/08/23, 9:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session here. We shall now connect tomorrow to move forward with our journey!🛩️

24/08/23, 10:07 am - Luminous Advertisements: The learnt how to look for companies that can join hands with EDOOFA.  And that I need to check four things about the companies: what they do, how big they are, how much money they have, and who started them. I can use Google and LinkedIn to find these things and also to talk to the people who work there. I can also see their website, app, social media, and what they are doing now. And If I get stuck, I can ask my mentor for help.

01/09/23, 8:39 am - Luminous Advertisements: Good morning 
I am ready
01/09/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, The first and second companies are student-centric companies which means that if they partner with us, this will help our students as they can provide our students with projects and in some cases, even employment opportunities.
And the third company is an electric company which does not satisfy our criteria for the Nature of the Company.
01/09/23, 8:50 am - Luminous Advertisements: Oh okay I understand now
01/09/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
We can do that via platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly Linked In.
01/09/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: I will need you to create your accounts on all these platforms and share your usernames with me in our session in the format mentioned below:
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
Linked In Id Link:
01/09/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, When you have created the accounts on all these platforms, You can use the search features provided on all these platforms to look for companies that suit our criteria.
01/09/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: For example, I talk about LinkedIn, You can type Education in the search bar once you open it.
Not just this, on Google, you can simply type, ‘Small scale Educational companies in African countries
After that, you will see various websites that might have some information about various companies. Go through those companies, the company whom you think best fits the criterion of being that suitable company, and search for all the details required in the form via LINKEDIN and GOOGLE.
04/09/23, 7:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my proud Edoofian!

I hope you are doing great! I wanted to let you know that I won't be able to connect today because I have some personal work that needs my urgent attention.

04/09/23, 7:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Are you ready for your session?✨

15/09/23, 2:47 pm - Luminous Advertisements: I get home at 6pm after school
18/09/23, 8:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
19/09/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?✨
20/09/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you? Are you ready for your session?🚀
20/09/23, 8:59 am - Luminous Advertisements: Hello how are you, after considering the options, 

My parents will not be available for sessions, they have quite a huge work load, so if possible I can try and do the initial sessions, on the normal slots on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday, If we can expedite the process within three days 

Because of religious purposes, I will not be available on Saturdays
20/09/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so are you available today?
20/09/23, 9:01 am - Luminous Advertisements: Yes I am,
20/09/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 9:08 am - Luminous Advertisements: Yes I did
20/09/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, we shall discuss the projects in detail after you are done with your exams.
20/09/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how NAME can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 9:13 am - Luminous Advertisements: We’re on the same page
20/09/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Thursday - 12:00 pm  to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
20/09/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
20/09/23, 9:20 am - Luminous Advertisements: Understood
20/09/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, now all I want you to just drop this message on the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 9:21 am - Luminous Advertisements: Okay
20/09/23, 9:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your school. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
20/09/23, 9:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: In order to do that you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
20/09/23, 10:44 am - Luminous Advertisements: I understand
28/09/23, 10:26 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, may I ask if you were able to send the mails?

I understand that you're currently dealing with exams, but I've shared a video with you to support your studies. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress and want to see you succeed in your examinations.

I must admit that I'm quite disappointed that there hasn't been a response from you. Communication is essential for us to work together effectively. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Let's ensure we're on the same page and working toward your success.

Apologies I haven’t been using my phone much due to exams, will reconvene after exams 🙏🙏
07/11/23, 6:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Takunda and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

Let us begin our session with a fun fact: Do you know that butterflies taste with their feet! They have special sensors on their tiny footpads that help them 'taste' their surroundings. It's like having a built-in flavor detector on their feet! 🦋👣

*_Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:_*

 The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.🤯🗼
