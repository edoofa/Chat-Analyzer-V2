15/09/23, 9:32 pm - +260 95 3025773: Dear mentor, my name is Mebelo Mebelo, the father to Mendai Mebelo. Mendai's EWYL group is Mendai EWYL23E0611. The counselling session has been completed with the Admissions Team. However, Mendai is unable to join thd group due to restrictions to phones at his school. However, as his father I am ready to proceed with the session if fine with you.

16/09/23, 9:57 am - +260 95 3025773: Good morning. Noted, thank you very much.
16/09/23, 10:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be Menadi's mentor. Before connecting today, I was given the responsibility for Mendai's application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about from his counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of his application, particularly *his desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest.
16/09/23, 10:03 am - +260 95 3025773: Glad you have the information about Mendai.
16/09/23, 10:24 am - +260 95 3025773: Morning Ms Aditi. It is our pleasure to have you as the mentor for Mendai.

16/09/23, 12:56 pm - +260 95 3025773: I am available
16/09/23, 12:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that is great!
16/09/23, 12:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you and have a good day sir!
16/09/23, 12:59 pm - +260 95 3025773: Thank you very much. Wishing you a great day and fruitful coming week.

19/09/23, 1:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings
Hope you are well.

I apologize for not being able to take your session due to a prior commitment to address a personal matter.
Thank you for understanding.
19/09/23, 1:25 pm - +260 97 8108842: Afternoon. We are doing fine. Hope you are alright too. It is understood.
19/09/23, 1:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, thank you.
We will resume sessions tomorrow and I can for you schedule them for Wednesday Thursday and Friday!

20/09/23, 2:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
I hope you are doing really well.

 So, are you ready to start our session?
20/09/23, 2:06 pm - +260 97 8108842: Afternoon. We can start.
20/09/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @260978108842 I have actually changed the timings of the session to 2:00 to 3:00 PM, I hope that it's fine with you?
20/09/23, 2:13 pm - +260 97 8108842: Time is fine.
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that is great!
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/09/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 8108842: You can shed some more light. However, the objectives are basically ensuring that Mendai gets connected to high quality universities and also give an opportunity to understand what the various universities have on offer.
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that NAME is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
20/09/23, 2:31 pm - +260 97 8108842: It is clear. Thanks for the refresher.
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - +260 97 8108842: This is quite encouraging. I have read through the email.
20/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope Mendai will also earn good amount of credits in the future.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - +260 97 8108842: Absolutely. He is really determined to do so.
20/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is great!
20/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
20/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/09/23, 3:01 pm - +260 97 8108842: Noted, and thanks a lot. Looking forward to more interaction with the team.
20/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure Sir!
20/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates NAME to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days
20/09/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today!

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
20/09/23, 3:03 pm - +260 97 8108842: Thanks a lot. Wishing you a fruitful day.
21/09/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?
21/09/23, 2:16 pm - +260 97 8108842: We are alright. Yes I am are.
21/09/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once Mendai forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

22/09/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 95 3025773: Afternoon
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 95 3025773: We are alright. Hope you are too.
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 95 3025773: We can begin
22/09/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am good.
Thanks.
22/09/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Mendai's EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure Mendai is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
22/09/23, 2:40 pm - +260 95 3025773: Great! Points taken.
22/09/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
22/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Mendai will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
22/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 3:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
22/09/23, 3:11 pm - +260 95 3025773: Thank you very much. Looking forward to the session on Monday. Still reading through the EWYL Doc you sent esrlier on. Enjoy yiur weekend.
25/09/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Mendai can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things Mendai is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
25/09/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. Once Mendai is back, he is supposed to note a few things.

Either you can make the decision on his behalf, or he can be active for a few minutes in the session and let us know what timetable would be most suited to proceed with once he is back from school.
25/09/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To choose a batch for the sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
25/09/23, 2:13 pm - +260 97 8108842: He will be back home early December 2023 when schools close. He will be available from then onwards.
25/09/23, 2:13 pm - +260 97 8108842: Monday and Thursday would be fine.
25/09/23, 2:15 pm - +260 97 8108842: Sessions requiring his participation will only be possible once schools close in December
25/09/23, 2:17 pm - +260 97 8108842: Noted
25/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 8108842: Otherwise we are good to continue
25/09/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted.
25/09/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In the sessions (that will be happening on the days chosen), the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter will be discussed.
25/09/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All the conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.

25/09/23, 2:49 pm - +260 97 8108842: Given that he is not around till December 2023 what is your guidance?
25/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
