Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.  Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.

21 - 28 Dec 2023 01:08PM - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way: 1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‚ÄòA-Level‚Äô/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad. 2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities. 3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools. 4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
22 - 28 Dec 2023 01:08PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school‚Äôs per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director. The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they: 1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

3 - 28 Dec 2023 01:06PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Edwin, I trust this message finds you in good health.  As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year‚Äîa time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, *I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity because you have not acknowledged my previous messages*
4 - 28 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
5 - 28 Dec 2023 01:11PM - +260 97 2378942: I‚Äôm so  sorry, I didn‚Äôt see the messages so I didn‚Äôt know that you sent a message before this. The grant is very significant to me and there are no misunderstandings.

So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:  1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

46 - 28 Dec 2023 08:32PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *""I am a proud Edoofian*.

As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year‚Äîa time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, *I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity because you have not acknowledged my previous messages*
3 - 28 Dec 2023 01:14PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?
4 - 28 Dec 2023 04:20PM - +91 93118 52843: The grant is of great significance to me and l also thrive to make the milestone worthwhile and believe me l am trying my best on the projects.

82 - 28 Dec 2023 08:32PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *""I am a proud Edoofian*.

3 - 27 Dec 2023 04:12PM - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Loice, I trust this message finds you in good health.  As we approach the year's end, I find myself eagerly anticipating the new year‚Äîa time filled with optimism, hope, and the chance to cultivate meaningful connections. However, upon reflecting on our journey, I've noticed a degree of inconsistency and irregularity.  I know it is the holiday season, and having Christmas celebrations and New Year festivities might be keeping you busy. Additionally, I understand that ongoing exams demand your time and attention, which led us to pause our EWYL sessions. While we took this step from our end, I haven't observed a reciprocal update from your side regarding your progress. I'm wondering if there's a misunderstanding on my part or if perhaps the grant isn't as significant for you. Could you provide some clarity on this matter?

Now, here are 2 things I‚Äôd like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
62 - 28 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
63 - 28 Dec 2023 02:12PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
64 - 28 Dec 2023 02:16PM - +263 71 401 4355: Noted thank you
65 - 28 Dec 2023 02:26PM - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what have you understood from the process?
66 - 28 Dec 2023 02:35PM - +263 71 401 4355: I understood that to make the project easy it is wiser to form a WhatsApp group with my name and the name of my mentor. We also need to find the right applicants and share them about EDOOFA. To get the right students I have to reach out to the form 6 and the form 5 students and share the link to my WhatsApp group and share information  about the opportunity to get the chance to get education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100%.
67 - 28 Dec 2023 03:06PM - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

50 - 27 Dec 2023 02:29PM - +263 78 307 6096: I understood that the second project works towards community building.It teaches Edofians community building by strengthening connections, communication, relationships and sharrling identities with a certain group of people or individuals.The project ,creates an environment where individuals feel a sense of belonging.They can collaborate, communicate and work towards common goals.This project is there to foster  a positive   community that promotes social introduction and participation in a shared responsibility and ownership towards achieving the little success.The primary outcome of the project is for students to gain good networking skills,and how to use social media to offer African students an opportunity to join the Edofians Educational ecosystem and acquire international education that can prepare them for their future.This is obtained from identifying willing youths who are willing to pursue the program and connect them with Edoofa .The Edoofa will also assist the students so that their efforts will not go to waste.The project teaches students to identify opportunities and use them to  change the lives of others.

69 - 28 Dec 2023 02:27PM - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination). Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6. Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

71 - 28 Dec 2023 02:27PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
72 - 28 Dec 2023 02:27PM - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120

118 - 28 Dec 2023 08:24AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Ruvarashe I hope you are doing well  *üåå ""Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning."" - Albert Einstein üåü*  As we delve into Einstein's insightful words, we're reminded of the dynamic journey of learning and growth. ""Learn from yesterday"" encourages reflection on past experiences, ""live for today"" emphasizes the present moment, and ""hope for tomorrow"" instills a forward-looking mindset.  In the context of your academic pursuit, this quote beckons you to embrace the continuous cycle of learning, applying knowledge in the present, and fostering hope for the future. Each question you pose becomes a stepping stone to new discoveries and personal development.  So, how are you doing today? üåà I'm buzzing with excitement to explore, learn, and grow together in our session. Let's turn challenges into opportunities and make this session truly worthwhile!
119 - 28 Dec 2023 08:28AM - +263 78 181 2643: Good morning ma'am.. I'm doing well thank you and how are you doing too?
120 - 28 Dec 2023 08:29AM - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning! I'm glad to hear that you're doing well. I am absolutely alright, thank you for asking.

217 - 28 Dec 2023 10:24AM - +263 78 181 2643: 2. Dear Sir or Madam I am Ruvarashe a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*I would also like my fellow brothers and sisters from your school to join me in grabbing this opportunity which rarely happens. Here students can complete their tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy since they have to undergo certain steps. Furthermore the Edoofa Scholarship program is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr G. M Chipare making it a safe platform. It would be a great honor if you would allow me to introduce this program into your school and help my fellow brothers and sisters who also have the desire to study abroad.  Thank you üôè
218 - 28 Dec 2023 10:25AM - +263 78 181 2643: 3. The school is located in Manicaland province
219 - 28 Dec 2023 10:40AM - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
220 - 28 Dec 2023 10:44AM - +263 78 181 2643: Yes I agree
221 - 28 Dec 2023 11:00AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head‚Äôs Contact. Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head‚Äôs Contact.   Once you get the headmaster‚Äôs number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.  The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
222 - 28 Dec 2023 11:07AM - Sharda Edoofa: Ruvarashe, we are only left with a very less discussion on this project and then we will be done with the Initial training. I will be away for an hour from now on. Do let me know if you are available after that.

168 - 28 Dec 2023 02:46PM - +263 77 172 2758: Question 2 : Difference between rights and duties and give a further explanation of the difference between human rights and civil rights.. Firstly l would like to explain the meaning of word rights ,rights are legal, social or ethical principles of freedom.. Duties are a task or action that one is required to perform as part of one's job..it can be called assignment, task ,chores and mission.. Therefore the difference between the two is noted ..moreover the difference between human rights and civil rights need to be noted , human rights are rights one acquires by being alive while Civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state.Civil rights are legal rights that protect individuals from discrimination based on race, sex and other characteristics.. It is important to know human rights are rights you are born with you have them simply by being human, whether or not they have been put into the  form of a law in the country where you reside..both human rights and civil rights protect against discrimination, injustice and inequality though it is important to note the difference between the two as Civil rights are designed to protect individuals in freedom from violation by government, political and social..
169 - 28 Dec 2023 02:46PM - +263 77 172 2758: Question 3:  The difference between a prosecutor and Attorney..  It is important to note that an attorney is a lawyer who practices as a professional advicer or advocate in legal matters. While a Prosecutor is a lawyer who determines whether to charge an individual for a crime and works to establish that person's guilt in court. He works to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt while the defence attorney attempts to create reasonable doubts so that their client is deemed innocent.. A good prosecutor is proficient in investigative work, writing, and sneaking. They can create a strong case against an accused and at ease in front of a jury or a judge .In addition to being experts in all facets of criminal law ,prosecutors must be skilled in communicating with other parties including the victims, defense witness, judges and law enforcement. A defence attorney is a prosecutor's counterpart. An attorney who protects a person or business against criminal accusations is a defence Attorney hence it can be argued that they is a different between an Attorney and a prosecutor..
170 - 28 Dec 2023 02:46PM - +263 77 172 2758: Question 4:which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, civil, corporate or criminal law and Why?  Civil law offers a high degree of legal certain as the laws are explicitly defined and interpreted by the legislative. This predictability can provide stability and confidence to individuals and businesses when making legal decisions. It ensures that the rights and protection of citizens are called for .The rule of law dictates that government should not abuse their powers as per AV diceys concept of the rule of law. The civil courts endorse economic activity, allowing contracts to be made between strangers they are breached.To study the civil law it requires business sense, communication creative problem solving and organization those are some of the skills l have thus why l think l deserve to study civil law. It also deals with cases that are mostly related to divorce, child custody, property ownership and personal property damage.. hence  could love to pursue Civil law  due to my desire to change life and help people..",No,Yes

146 - 27 Dec 2023 05:03PM - +263 78 610 6366: ?2    Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a furtherexplanation of the difference in Human Rights and Civil Rights. Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. Rights are the entitlements that individuals or groups have, while duties are the obligations or responsibilities that individuals or groups have towards others or society as a whole.  Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that are entitled to all human beings, regardless of their race, gender, nationality, religion, or any other status. These rights are inherent to human beings and are often enshrined in international law. Civil rights, on the other hand, are the rights that individuals have as citizens of a particular country. These rights are often related to political and social freedoms, such as the right to vote, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly.  In summary, while rights and duties are interconnected, human rights and civil rights are distinct concepts that refer to different types of rights. ?3: What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney? - A prosecutor is a lawyer who represents the government in criminal cases. Their job is to investigate and prosecute individuals who are accused of committing crimes. They work closely with law enforcement officials to build a case against the defendant and present evidence in court.  An attorney, on the other hand, is a legal professional who provides legal advice and representation to individuals or organizations. Attorneys can specialize in various areas of law, such as criminal law, family law, or corporate law. They may represent clients in court or in negotiations with other parties.  In summary, while both prosecutors and attorneys are legal professionals, prosecutors work for the government to prosecute criminal cases, while attorneys provide legal advice and representation to individual clients. 4. Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Corporate or Criminal, and why? I want to pursue with Criminal law because lam  drawn to the challenge of defending the accused and ensuring that justice is served. Iam also interested in the investigative and research aspects of criminal law, such as gathering evidence and building a strong case. Still l may also be interested in the social and ethical aspects of criminal law, such as advocating for the rights of the accused and working to reform the criminal justice system.  5. What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with an example Some of these skills that l qualify  include strong analytical and critical thinking abilities, excellent communication and interpersonal skills, attention to detail, and the ability to work well under pressure.  For example, a successful lawyer may need to analyze complex legal documents and arguments, communicate effectively with clients and other stakeholders, pay close attention to details in contracts or other legal documents, and handle high-pressure situations such as court hearings or negotiations and l believe that l have all these skills

Thermodynamics is the study of the effects of work, heavy, and energy on a system. It is only concerned with macroscopic change and observations such as change in temperature. Thermodynamics is in general terms concerned with the transition of energy from one position to another and from one form to another. There are three laws of thermodynamics known to man which are as follows the first law states when energy moves in or out of the system. The systems internal energy changes in accordance with the law of conservation of mass in simpler terms energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another for example kinetic engery - the energy that an object possesses when it moves it is converted to heat energy when a driver presses the brakes on the car to slow it down. The second law states there exists a useful state variable called entropy. The change in entropy is equal th the heat transfer divided by the temperature. An example when we put an ice cube in a cup with water at room temperature. The water at room temperature releases off heat and the ice cube melts, hence the entropy of water drops. The third law states the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as temperature approaches zero for example vapour of water at high temperatures as the molecules within steam are randomly moving this it will have a high entropy.
38 - 28 Dec 2023 09:04AM - +260 96 8651816: Q3. A valve is a device or natural object that regulates, directs or controls the flow of a fluid by opening, closing or partially obstructing various passageways. A butterfly valve is a type of a valve which is used to shut the flow of fluid. It is often said that butterfly valves can be used to regulate the flow of fluid, however it is not recommended using it as it can damage the valve disk and have a negative effect on the sealing properties. The valve requires less structural support than a ball valve of comparable diameter. These valves are commonly used in pipe lines in handling large fluid flows.
39 - 28 Dec 2023 09:04AM - +260 96 8651816: Q4. Heat treating is a group of industrial thermal and metal working processes used to alter the physical and sometimes chemical properties of the material. It can also be defined as the heating or chilling normally to extreme temperatures to achieve the desired result such as hardening or softening of a material. It is done to improve the mechanical properties of a material that include hardness, tensile, strength, shock, resistance, ductility and resistance to corrosion to improve mechinability and reduce brittleness and make the versatile. Heat treatment are also used in the manufacture of many other materials such as glass. Although the term heat treatment applies only to processes where the heating and cooling are done for specific of altering properties intentionally, heating and cooling often occur incidentally during other manufacturing such as hot forming or welding.
40 - 28 Dec 2023 09:04AM - +260 96 8651816: Q5. A compressor can be defined as an instrument or device used to compress something or a machine used to supply air or other gas at increased pressure for example to a gas turbine. There are thirteen types of compressors created by man namely centrifugal compressor, rotary - screw compressor, scroll compressors, axial compressor, rotary vane compressor, compressor, dynamic compressor, rotary screw compressor, reciprocating compressor, piston compressor, classification of air compressor and oil free compressor. Centrifugal compressor is used to power gas turbines engines used in jet aircrafts. It is used because turbines are used due to higher rotating speeds and the centrifugal compressor are used in pipeline booster services where high volume and low compression ratios exist.

169 - 28 Dec 2023 01:52AM - +263 73 736 4250: 2. The difference between rights and duties is that rights are claims of and individual that are essential for the development of his own self and that are recognized by society or even state whereas a duty is something that someone is expected to do. Some of the duties include that of obeying laws, paying taxes, defending the nation and serving on juries. There are also types of duties like that of legal duties, professional duties and many more. Human rights are rights one acquires by being alive whereas Civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state. Human Rights include that of the right to life, the right to a fair trial, freedom from torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the rights to health, education and an adequate standard of living and these are at an individual or personal level and at the same time civil rights include that of the right to vote, the right to a fair trial, the right to government services, the right to a public education, the right to gainful employment, the right to housing, the right to use public facilities, freedom of religion  3. The difference between a prosecutor and an attorney is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the  defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, while the attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the client's innocence.  4.The branch of Law in which im interested in pursuing is the corporate law. This is the body of law which governs the rights, relations and conduct of people, companies, organizations and businesses. This also refers to the legal practice of law relating to corporations. The reason behind studying this type of law is that my main aim is helping, and mostly standing with the truth, as i will be governing the rights of people I get to help people out there whom are being deprived of their rights in which their voices need to be heard, i can also stand against abuses within people out there, be it child abuse or even marital abuse. All in all helping the community for the good is the goal.  5. The skills i have that will help me in becoming a very good and successful lawyer include that of organizational skills. This is whereby i can proudly say i am someone who uses her resources efficiently and effectively.  Most of all im not someone who can just let an opportunity slip and leave it like that. Another skill is time management, since primary level up to date im not someone who isn't punctual, punctuality is something i put first in life because time does not not wait for anyone once you lose time or an opportunity, you are not to get any of it back which makes me want to strive to be  more and more better everyday as to time management is concerned. I can also proudly say that i have written communication skills, whereby i can express my self clearly out there and well as constructing a logical argument with facts which is one of the things needed to pursue the career i have chosen. Lastly, persuasive communication is yet another skill, since growing up i have been told that confidence is the key to even success because once one is confident about what she does nothing will ever go wrong and most of all when one is confident she is likely to have people go against because she will be there to stand up with the facts. I believe with all this i can accomplish my law career

Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
31 - 27 Dec 2023 03:15PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
66 - 28 Dec 2023 06:35PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:  1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.  2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.  3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.  4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
67 - 28 Dec 2023 06:35PM - Kirti Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?

118 - 28 Dec 2023 06:57PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.

119 - 28 Dec 2023 06:57PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.
120 - 28 Dec 2023 07:13PM - +263 71 947 4887: Clear
121 - 28 Dec 2023 07:29PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-  *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
122 - 28 Dec 2023 07:29PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa‚Äôs recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.  I hope you are following?
123 - 28 Dec 2023 07:37PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes I am following
124 - 28 Dec 2023 07:47PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -  *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
125 - 28 Dec 2023 07:47PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.  I hope these are clear as well?
128 - 28 Dec 2023 07:55PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern. Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.  Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?

This discrepancy was an oversight from our side, and it seems it wasn't noticed by you as well. The reason we share the breakdown with you as parents is to avoid these errors.

21 - 28 Dec 2023 06:45PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
56 - 28 Dec 2023 08:12PM - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
57 - 28 Dec 2023 08:12PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
58 - 28 Dec 2023 08:12PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
59 - 28 Dec 2023 08:12PM - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
60 - 28 Dec 2023 08:18PM - +263 77 953 0090: do you mean if l obtain more than 6 points l would qualify for a 50%scholarship
61 - 28 Dec 2023 08:47PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
62 - 28 Dec 2023 08:49PM - +263 77 953 0090: yes they won't be able
63 - 28 Dec 2023 08:49PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?  *1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)* *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)* *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
64 - 28 Dec 2023 08:50PM - +263 77 953 0090: yes l agree
65 - 28 Dec 2023 08:52PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -  *1. Reappear in A Level*  Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
68 - 28 Dec 2023 09:01PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*  Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
69 - 28 Dec 2023 09:01PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
70 - 28 Dec 2023 09:03PM - +263 77 953 0090: yes am clear
71 - 28 Dec 2023 09:04PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,  *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*  Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
72 - 28 Dec 2023 09:06PM - +263 77 953 0090: ouk l get it
73 - 28 Dec 2023 09:23PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
74 - 28 Dec 2023 09:25PM - +263 77 953 0090: no l have understood the whole process
75 - 28 Dec 2023 09:29PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process?

Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?

Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.  It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.

As your admission officer, I consider this present to be the best you've received this year, as it opens doors for your higher education and provides you with an opportunity to pursue a successful career, doesn't it?

24 - 28 Dec 2023 03:49PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:  1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800 2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200 3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800  Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800

27 - 28 Dec 2023 04:36PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263772407949 right now what I have shared is the annual cost, so please do not worry about it.
28 - 28 Dec 2023 04:36PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
29 - 28 Dec 2023 04:36PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
30 - 28 Dec 2023 04:36PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
31 - 28 Dec 2023 04:36PM - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?",No,Yes

Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).

141 - 28 Dec 2023 05:50PM - +263 71 418 5330: 2. Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference in Human Rights and Civil rights.  Rights are defined as claims of an individual that are essential for the development of his or her own self and that are recognized by society or the State these include the right to life, the right to a fair trial, freedom from torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the rights to health, education and an adequate standard of living.whilst a duty is something that someone is expected or required to do .Examples of duties  include obeying laws, paying taxes, defending the nation and serving on . Furthermore  human rights are the rights you have simply for being a human being which the right to a fair trial and presumption of innocence,freedom of thought, conscience and religion,freedom of opinion and expression,peaceful assembly,freedom of association,  participation in public affairsComparatively, civil rights are contextual meaning you are entitled to specific civil rights through being a citizen of a particular country, nation, or state. Civil rights are proclaimed by the government for the citizens of that country, while human rights are derived from natural law and are universally protected and applied.
142 - 28 Dec 2023 05:53PM - +263 71 418 5330: 3. What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney   One of the critical distinguishing factors is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt while the defense attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the client's innocence . The prosecutor must charge the accused with a specific crime or crimes, then present evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty .The prosecutor must also gather evidence to present in court, interview and prepare witnesses to testify in court, research all aspects of the case to prepare for cross-examination, and prepare opening and closing statements.The defense attorney must defend their client against criminal charges. The client is innocent until proven guilty.The attorney represents the client‚Äôs best interests at all stages of legal proceedings from arraignment to sentencing.The attorney helps the client to avoid incriminating himself and making sure the client‚Äôs constitutional rights are not violated.
143 - 28 Dec 2023 05:55PM - +263 71 418 5330: 4.Which branch of law are you interested in pursuing, Civil , Corporate, Criminal and why ?   I want to study corporate law because it is an ideal career for my personal goals. I value financial stability and job security in my career,and corporate law provides these, as well as being a fascinating field that offers endless complex problems to solve and demands a wide variety of skills. I researched about corporate law during high school and I enjoyed the day-to-day work and the opportunity to collaborate, problem-solve and think critically about a variety of different matters.  Corporate law is an ideal lifelong career for me.Although sometimes the study of corporate law can be abstract in nature, the practice of corporate law offers a practical and hands-on career. With my legal knowledge I will be able to make a difference in businesses, and communities.  The ability to help others through the use of the  corporate law is not only highly rewarding but most importantly, serves a very needed purpose in the  business society.Corporate lawyers typically have an in-depth understanding of business practices, regulations and documents. In this profession, I might become an expert on topics like contracts, mergers and venture capital. I may also learn about business strategy by observing key decision-making

Drafting a contract is very different from writing a letter to a client therefore my skills in written communication will help me excel in my career.Verbal communication is key in the legal field and therefore my skills in verbal communication will help me excel since I have experience in public speaking and debate . Communicating my ideas to, as well as the various situations and environments I might find myself in, will alter the way I communicate. Communication is always supplemented with a goal, whether it is to simply get ng point across to my co-worker, or convince a jury. When it comes to law having a rock-solid grasp on spoken word is essential and it helps in winning a case and dominantly excelling .Also lm able to work under pressure As a lawyerI will be required to overcome obstacles and think on the spot on the daily. Thereforebeing high-functioning whilst under internal or external pressure is essential for my career. Whether I am working overnight to meet a deadline or talking to a difficult client working in a people-focused career will undoubtedly bring pressure along therefore my skill will help me overcome these obstacles and become a great lawyer. By applying ycommercial awarenessI will be able to stay abreast of changes in the legal sector and demonstrate to employers and clients that l have the necessary knowledge and law skills. This will help me stand out in the competitive job market and position myself for success in the legal profession.Detail  Attention to detail is an essential skill for any aspiring lawyer. In order to be successful in the field, you must be able to read and interpret complex legal documents, accurately recall facts and information, and spot inconsistencies between documents. Attention to detail is also  a skill which I  have which is important when it comes to researching and interpreting laws, as well as understanding case law and precedents. This skill is particularly important when it comes to assessing documents and sources. An ability to spot key pieces of information is highly important,whether lm  looking for evidence to support my case or proofreading a contract where missing a detail could derail the whole task. Thus the above stated are skills which l have , thus they will help me to excel in my line of study

Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.  *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions.  You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
121 - 28 Dec 2023 01:51PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA‚Äôs vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
122 - 28 Dec 2023 01:51PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
123 - 28 Dec 2023 01:51PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students‚Äô skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

121 - 28 Dec 2023 10:19AM - +263 71 577 9523: 2:The relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development is a very important one! Entrepreneurship is often seen as the engine of economic growth, because it creates jobs, stimulates innovation, and boosts productivity. In addition, entrepreneurs often bring new ideas, technologies, and products to the market, which can help spur economic development. At the same time, a strong economy can encourage more people to start their own businesses, which in turn helps the economy grow even further. It's a cycle that benefits everyone involved. I'd like to talk about two other factors that are related to the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development: risk-taking and innovation. Entrepreneurs often take risks in order to start and grow their businesses, and this risk-taking can lead to innovation, which in turn leads to economic growth. It's a virtuous cycle that can be very beneficial to society as a whole. Without entrepreneurs, we might not have some of the amazing technologies and products that we enjoy today, like smartphones, social media, or ride-sharing apps. So it's clear that entrepreneurship is closely tied to economic development..  Another important aspect of the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development is the role of government. Governments often provide incentives and support for entrepreneurs, such as tax breaks, funding opportunities, and business incubators. This support can help entrepreneurs to succeed, and in turn, boost economic development. At the same time, governments can also create regulations and policies that make it harder for entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses. So it's a delicate balance, and governments must be careful not to stifle innovation while still providing support for entrepreneurs.  3:GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and it's a set of rules and guidelines that accountants follow when preparing financial statements. GAAP is important because it helps to ensure that financial statements are prepared consistently and accurately, so that they can be used to make informed decisions about a company's financial health. Without GAAP, there would be no standard way to measure and report financial information, which could lead to confusion and even fraud. GAAP also helps to ensure that companies are disclosing all of the relevant information about their financial health to investors, regulators, and other interested parties.   Another important reason why GAAP is important is that it helps to create trust in the financial system. When companies are held to a high standard of accounting and reporting, it gives investors and other stakeholders confidence in the financial system as a whole. Without GAAP, there would be less transparency and confidence in the financial system, which could lead to instability and even crises. In short, GAAP is vital for ensuring the smooth functioning of the financial system.  4: Accounting standards are the specific rules and principles that govern how financial statements are prepared. These standards are typically set by a governing body, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States. Accounting standards are mandatory because they help to ensure that all companies are using the same methods to prepare their financial statements. This allows for comparisons between companies and helps to ensure that financial statements are reliable and consistent. Without accounting standards, there would be no way to ensure that financial statements are fair and accurate.  The other important things to understand about accounting standards is that they are constantly evolving. As the economy and business world changes, so do the rules that govern financial reporting.Financial Accounting Standards Board(FASB), for example, regularly reviews and updates its standards to reflect changes in the marketplace. This ensures that accounting standards are always relevant and effective.  In addition, it's important to note that different countries have their own sets of accounting standards. For example, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are used by many countries around the world. However, the U.S. still uses GAAP for most publicly traded companies   5: Accounting and auditing are two closely related, but distinct activities. Accounting refers to the process of preparing and reporting financial information, while auditing is the process of verifying and evaluating that financial information. In other words, accounting is the process of recording and reporting financial transactions, while auditing is the process of checking that the information reported is accurate and reliable. Both activities are important in maintaining financial transparency and integrity.Accounting provides the data, and auditing ensures that the data is reliable.  Accounting as the ""back-end"" of a company's financial reporting, while auditing is the ""front-end."" Accounting is the day-to-day process of recording transactions, maintaining records, and preparing financial statements. Auditing, on the other hand, is the process of independently assessing the accuracy and reliability of those financial statements. Auditing often takes place after the accounting is done, as a way to verify the information that has been reported. Auditors may also provide recommendations for improving accounting procedures and internal controls.

129 - 28 Dec 2023 01:46PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am
130 - 28 Dec 2023 01:50PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BCom for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
131 - 28 Dec 2023 01:51PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am that's correct
137 - 28 Dec 2023 01:56PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
138 - 28 Dec 2023 02:15PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am
139 - 28 Dec 2023 02:19PM - +263 71 577 9523: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _Ms Saloni  and she has scheduled my session for _1 hour
140 - 28 Dec 2023 02:28PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Saloni. I appreciate you sharing the session time with us.  Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
141 - 28 Dec 2023 02:28PM - +263 71 577 9523: Thank you ma'am
142 - 28 Dec 2023 02:47PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
143 - 28 Dec 2023 02:47PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process
144 - 28 Dec 2023 02:47PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
145 - 28 Dec 2023 02:49PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am he did
146 - 28 Dec 2023 02:51PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
169 - 28 Dec 2023 04:05PM - +263 71 577 9523: I'm done ma'am
170 - 28 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
171 - 28 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*  On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
172 - 28 Dec 2023 04:06PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.  This means Vimbainashe, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
173 - 28 Dec 2023 04:09PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am I understand
174 - 28 Dec 2023 04:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*  I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
175 - 28 Dec 2023 04:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
176 - 28 Dec 2023 04:39PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
177 - 28 Dec 2023 04:53PM - +263 71 577 9523: Oky ma'am I understand
178 - 28 Dec 2023 04:53PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*  I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
194 - 28 Dec 2023 05:20PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?  *1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)* *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)* *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
195 - 28 Dec 2023 05:20PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes I agree
196 - 28 Dec 2023 05:21PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -  *1. Reappear in A Level*  Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
197 - 28 Dec 2023 05:21PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
198 - 28 Dec 2023 05:40PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am very clear
199 - 28 Dec 2023 06:32PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*  Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
200 - 28 Dec 2023 06:32PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
201 - 28 Dec 2023 06:33PM - +263 71 577 9523: Yes ma'am it's clear
202 - 28 Dec 2023 06:34PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,  *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*  Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.

12 - 28 Dec 2023 07:14PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.

It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
40 - 27 Dec 2023 08:39PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation.

The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success.  I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

41 - 28 Dec 2023 07:55PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?

43 - 28 Dec 2023 08:35PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
44 - 28 Dec 2023 08:35PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
45 - 28 Dec 2023 08:35PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?

47 - 28 Dec 2023 09:09PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?

64 - 28 Dec 2023 08:05PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child‚Äôs Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
65 - 28 Dec 2023 08:05PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
66 - 28 Dec 2023 08:05PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee.  From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
72 - 28 Dec 2023 08:27PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
73 - 28 Dec 2023 08:27PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
74 - 28 Dec 2023 08:29PM - +263 78 948 9559: It sounds good
75 - 28 Dec 2023 08:33PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?

5 - 28 Dec 2023 07:55PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?

9 - 28 Dec 2023 08:20PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.  While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.

This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?

Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan.  While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.

93 - 28 Dec 2023 08:31PM - +263 78 911 9202: Your plan is not very flexible to use considering the finance  we earn differ from month to month meaning some other months we can certainly meet 150 but some other time might take time or even fail to reach 150 so being told to pay 150 per month might be very inconvenient and a disadvantage to us, rather than saving our own money at our own pace saving 150 , exceeding or not reaching according to how we earn that month

95 - 28 Dec 2023 08:47PM - +263 77 289 3917: Since the program is for 2025 intake , 1. Am I assured that a place at a good university will be guaranteed and that BBA will be the course  and no changes from  the course  preferred.  2.The $150 per month that will be paid over 20 months,will it earn interest over the 20 months ,if so what percentage, simple interest or compound.  3. If one is not flexible with $150  per month but can pay different amounts depending on what will have been raised that particular  month but in the end,say after 10 months you expect 1500 ,and I also make sure l raise 1500 in the 10 months is that possible or it's just strictly 150 and no deviation from that.
96 - 28 Dec 2023 08:49PM - +263 77 289 3917: 4. If in case ,come 2025 we fail to get accepted for the course we prefer ,what then happens .

Will we be cock sure that the money we deposited with Edoofa is safe from the negative financial effects likely to affect our local deposits?  4.Does this payment plan cover the 50%-100% scholarship batches such that it might be more in the event that we get a higher scholarship percentage....and better still if EWYL tokensare included?

10 - 28 Dec 2023 07:56PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms with me. Moving forward in our today‚Äôs session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.  If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
11 - 28 Dec 2023 08:22PM - +263 71 557 5509: we may start.
12 - 28 Dec 2023 08:26PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
13 - 28 Dec 2023 08:27PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
14 - 28 Dec 2023 08:27PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
18 - 28 Dec 2023 08:30PM - +263 71 557 5509: yes please.
19 - 28 Dec 2023 08:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of December 29, 2023.
20 - 28 Dec 2023 08:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months.  That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
21 - 28 Dec 2023 08:32PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
22 - 28 Dec 2023 08:39PM - +263 71 557 5509: the remaining $150 was paid today, and we sent thems receipts to Mr Austin but he hasn't viewed them...i think he busy
23 - 28 Dec 2023 09:09PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, in the meantime shall we proceed with the session for the admission process
24 - 28 Dec 2023 09:12PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today.

(The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

44 - 28 Dec 2023 01:13PM - +263 78 794 9160: The legal definition of ""law"" is the system of rules and regulations that govern a society. This includes both criminal law, which deals with crimes and punishments, and civil law, which deals with disputes between individuals or organizations. But there's also a broader definition of law that includes the principles and rules that guide human behavior.

56 - 28 Dec 2023 02:06PM - +263 78 794 9160: There are many reasons why l chose to study law abroad instead of in their home country. One reason is that studying abroad can provide a unique and valuable educational experience. By studying law in a different country, l can gain exposure to different legal systems and perspectives. This can be very beneficial for your future career, as it can give you a global perspective and make you a more well-rounded lawyer.
57 - 28 Dec 2023 02:17PM - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
58 - 28 Dec 2023 02:20PM - +263 78 794 9160: I want to become a leading role model for other children in my country
59 - 28 Dec 2023 02:24PM - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Ruth, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?

61 - 28 Dec 2023 02:43PM - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.  I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn‚Äôt it?
62 - 28 Dec 2023 02:48PM - +263 78 794 9160: Yes
63 - 28 Dec 2023 02:49PM - Garima Edoofa: The Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons  *1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges.

126 - 28 Dec 2023 10:05AM - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Tivaoneshe. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.  Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
127 - 28 Dec 2023 10:08AM - +263 71 722 8711: Noo
128 - 28 Dec 2023 10:53AM - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.  The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
129 - 28 Dec 2023 10:53AM - Garima Edoofa: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

136 - 28 Dec 2023 11:14AM - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Tivaoneshe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

270 - 28 Dec 2023 12:20PM - Gurvinder: Yes, I understand your problem, but education and general living is expensive in Zimbabwe too
271 - 28 Dec 2023 12:21PM - Gurvinder: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.  Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today‚Äôs time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*
272 - 28 Dec 2023 12:21PM - Gurvinder: While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
273 - 28 Dec 2023 02:11PM - +263 77 574 5393: Ok l have seen. Sorry for my late response we are under bad weather here in Zimbabwe.

The country has gone through a tragic past in hopes of reconciliation and unity world wide. This essay will cover the social, political and economic impacts on Rwanda after the genocide.  Rwanda was devastated emotionally, socially, and economically in the wake of the genocide. But the nation started a healing process under President Paul Kagame's inspiring direction. The quest of justice and reconciliation by Rwanda during the genocide has been one of the country's greatest features. The Gacaca courts are now community-based tribunals that aim to address the large number of violators and offer an environment for justice and truth-telling.  Furthermore, the emphasis on national identity of Rwanda and unity has been crucial in building a sense of unity among its citizens. The government's prioritisation of Rwandan identity over cultural differences has made an important contribution to the restoration and unity of the society.  Rwanda has undergone significant economic growth. The nation has experienced remarkable expansion in industries such as agriculture, tourism, and technology. With projects like the Kigali Development City powering the nation's technical developments, Kigali, the capital city, has emerged as a centre for innovation and technology in Africa. The country's natural beauty, such the magnificent mountain gorillas in Volcanoes National Park, has been highlighted deeply, demonstrating the development in tourism. These visitors come from all over the world.  Socially, there are some problems that the citizens still undergo. The genocide tragedy that had occurred still lingers which is affecting individuals and communities. Even though there has been some progress in the healing and reconciliation process, more has to be done to guarantee that all Rwandans have a sense of justice and closure. Further, opinions about Rwanda's political system are mixed. Although the government has received praise for its efforts in reconstructing the country and for its dedication to gender equality, as is demonstrated by the high percentage of women in parliament, concerns have also been expressed over political liberties and human rights.As it is seen that Rwanda is a dictatorship country.  Rwanda is a reminder to the human spirit perseverance and the ability to rise from the ashes of sorrow, despite these difficulties. Other countries coping with the impact of war and genocide can draw inspiration from the nation's achievements. In summary, 16 years after the genocide, Rwanda is a country that has come a long way in terms of growth, healing, and reconciliation. The change of Rwanda has been largely attributed to the people's determination and perseverance as well as their visionary leadership. Even though there are still difficulties, Rwanda's development is proof of the strength of cooperation, forgiveness, and the human spirit to rise above even the most trying times in history.  SECTION 6 PERSONALITY TEST ‚ÄúMy inspiration Story‚Äù  Title: ""My Journey""  In a small city in Lusaka Zambia, lived a girl named Martha. She basically lived in a boarding school where she was taking her tertiary education. She didn‚Äôt know what career path she wanted to undergo . She was lost and confused. Martha loved attending the computer class that was introduced to her. She especially enjoyed going to the labs for practicals because she always preferred practicality to theory. She was always curious and intrigued, on how the machine works and the wonders it can do.she engaged with the machine that seemed to hold within it a universe waiting to be unraveled.  When she first started learning how to code, she was intrigued. It was like learning a new language, a way to communicate with a computer. This brought about some unanticipated passion.  As she delved deeper into learning about computers, Martha discovered the power technology has and the amazing things it can do with just a line of code.‚Äîa tool not just for convenience but a canvas for innovation and change.  Martha‚Äôs had completed her tertiary education but at that moment, she still wasn‚Äôt sure about her career path .The turning point came when Martha attended an event with a female guest speaker, a trailblazer in the tech industry, sharing her journey. She was amazed when she saw that a woman is very much capable of achieving her goals and dreams through technology. In that moment, Martha imagined herself in the speaker‚Äôs story‚Äîa girl with dreams of doing anything she has can dream of with technology.  Driven by the speaker's words and her newfound passion, Martha had decided to embrace computer science as her career path. She spent countless hours learning, coding, and pushing the boundaries of her understanding. She spent most of her time researching about it and what it involves entirely.  When she applied for the course and was accepted at a university, she was overjoyed and couldn‚Äôt wait to start learning.Challenges emerged along the way when she started learning about the complex algorithms, debugging dilemmas. She had some self doubt and wondered if she can really handle the course she is undertaking.  She didn‚Äôt give up. She continued to study hard and practice as much as possible to improve her knowledge and skills. As she was studying,her inspiration blossomed into a resolute decision‚Äîto delve deeper into technology as her permanent career path. She realized that win the realms of technology, there was so much she would create and accomplish.  In choosing computer science, Martha didn‚Äôt just embrace a course but embraced a vision‚Äîa vision to be a part of a transformative force, shaping the future through lines of code and engineering , and inspiring others to embark on their own journeys into the boundless realm of technology. In technology she had found a sense of belonging and surety that being involved in creating and improving technology is something that will help her achieve her dream of having an impact. <This message was edited>
314 - 28 Dec 2023 09:02AM - +260 97 6317377: Good Morning Mr Gurvinder. I firstly want to apologize for the immense delay in submitting my test responses, when I received the assignment my phone switched off and I couldn‚Äôt charge it because electricity had gone. I apologize once again and I can promise that this was not deliberate. Secondly, my parents and I discussed everything yesterday mostly about how I should go about my higher education and the costs. We are aware of the Earn while you learn program which can help me reduce the burden of my parents paying the fees if I were to be eligible for the program. Though as I had informed you, I am currently studying for a degree and as I had mentioned I am in my second year first semester and will soon go into my second year second semester. So my degree is expected to be complete in 2026 if I am not mistaken. You had mentioned the enrolment fee being paid next year on the 2nd or 3rd of January meaning if it were paid the procedure would begin. Since I am currently studying in Zambia, I can only proceed with all the steps required properly after I complete. That way there won‚Äôt be any pressures upon my parents and I. You may wonder why I had applied for this program in the first place, that was because I was informed that the whole procedure takes a lot of time which could take years and that is why I wanted to apply in advance to see if I‚Äôll have any opportunities in the future after I complete my degree. I sincerely apologize if I have caused any inconvenience. I just wanted to address this as we are still in step 1 of the edoofa cycle to clarify everything so that we have a better understanding. Your response and guidance will be highly appreciated.

152 - 28 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
153 - 28 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.* <This message was edited>
154 - 28 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
230 - 28 Dec 2023 03:23PM - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
231 - 28 Dec 2023 03:23PM - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.  Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?

20 - 28 Dec 2023 11:56AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
21 - 28 Dec 2023 11:56AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22 - 28 Dec 2023 11:56AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

159 - 28 Dec 2023 12:47PM - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
160 - 28 Dec 2023 12:47PM - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
161 - 28 Dec 2023 12:47PM - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
182 - 28 Dec 2023 04:11PM - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
183 - 28 Dec 2023 04:20PM - +263 77 614 0897: Yes
184 - 28 Dec 2023 04:21PM - +263 77 614 0897: Yes it can benefit me
185 - 28 Dec 2023 04:25PM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Precious, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates. *2) Lawyer* As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court. *3) Public Prosecutor* A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor. *4) Judge* This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job. *5) Company Secretary* This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

37 - 28 Dec 2023 04:19PM - +263 78 868 2033: I loved electrical engineering because electrical engineers work in high-stake environments, they may face intense job pressure. They may also spend more hours at work meeting deadlines and completing their projects. Although electrical engineers may have excellent salary prospects, they often receive limited job growth. <This message was edited>
38 - 28 Dec 2023 04:28PM - +263 78 868 2033: In accounting, helping people solve their problems and achieve their business goals is a pretty rewarding way to spend my time.  Personal development and aspiration, intellectual growth and personal interest in accounting I also enjoy working with financial reports in my daily work and the constant learning aspect that comes with working in accounting for example enjoying using mathematics and the skills that come along with a math-focused career.

68 - 28 Dec 2023 10:11AM - Gurvinder: Well Shumirai as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:  *1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.  *2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .  *3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue.
69 - 28 Dec 2023 10:11AM - Gurvinder: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like  *1. Bachelors in  Pharmacy* *2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy* *3. Bachelors in Optometry* *4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology*  These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students

72 - 28 Dec 2023 01:00PM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

20 - 28 Dec 2023 03:32PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Tatenda, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
21 - 28 Dec 2023 04:01PM - +263 71 465 0030: Okay maybe l gonna have it. First l want to see what is needed for one to have a scholarship seat

May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?  Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

Sentence 4: It can be added to livestock feed as a protein supplement.  Sentence 5: If too much acid whey is released into the environment, it can pollute waterways, thus depleting oxygen content in water bodies as it decomposes.

A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth. Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles ‚Äì so much for rent, for food, for the children‚Äôs shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can‚Äôt really afford . As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.  1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage a)The cause of poverty is extravagance. b)Stingy habits of the poor. c)Being extravagant is always condemnable. d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.  2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time. b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle. c)Must be extravagant before achieving success. d)Should not bother about popularity.  3. The phrase ‚Äòlavish with his hospitality‚Äô in the third sentence of the first paragraph means a)Extravagance in entertaining guest. b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives. c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers. d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.  4.The word ‚Äòparadox‚Äô in the last sentence of the first paragraph means a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning b)Statement based on facts c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth. d)Statement based on the popular opinion  5.What is the meaning of the word ‚Äúequanimity‚Äù? a)Calmness b)Discomposure c)Equivocal d)Dubious  *_SECTION 3_*  *_Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions._* *_Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole._* *_After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is._*  Whey to Go Greek yogurt‚Äîa strained form of cultured yogurt‚Äîhas grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. A) NO CHANGE B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production. C) supplement, while sweet whey is more desirable as a food additive for humans. D) supplement, which provides an important element of their diet.  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE B) can pollute waterway‚Äôs, C) could have polluted waterways, D) has polluted waterway‚Äôs,  8.scientists; and A) NO CHANGE B) scientists: and C) scientists, and D) scientists, and,  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed A) where it is now. B) after sentence 1. C) after sentence 2. D) after sentence 3.  *_SECTION 4_* *Math Test ‚Äì No Calculator*  _1.	The use of a calculator is not permitted._ _2.

SECTION 6  Deep down in the roots of Chivhu there was a young man named Rutendo. One day he was once walking through the woods when he came across a wise old owl perched on a tree branch.He then took a while and asked the owl the secret to live a good life .The owl looked down at the boy and replied, ""The secret is to always be kind to others, even when they are not kind to you."" The boy thought about this and then asked himself if someone was really mean to him and what he should do then.The owl then encouraged him to be kind at all cost. Whilst she was in his confusion state he wondered how he can be kind to someone who is being mean to him. The Owl smiled at him and told him sometimes the kindest thing to do is simply walking away.One can not control how other people behave but can control how to react to them. He was surprised to find that as he practiced kindness, he began to feel happier and more at peace. He also noticed that the people around him seemed to be kinder, too. And whenever someone was unkind, he followed the owl's advice and walked away. In this way, he was able to create a life filled with happiness and peace. And he never forgot the owl's wise words: ""The secret to living a good life is to always be kind to others, even when they are not kind to you."" The boy carried this lesson with him for the rest of his life, and he passed it on to others.",No,Yes

195 - 28 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Harmehak: Zvikomborero, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?
196 - 28 Dec 2023 02:19PM - +263 71 339 9947: I agree
197 - 28 Dec 2023 02:24PM - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Zvikomborero?
198 - 28 Dec 2023 02:37PM - +263 71 339 9947: Yes ma'am
199 - 28 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Harmehak: That's great,  Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
200 - 28 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
201 - 28 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
202 - 28 Dec 2023 02:57PM - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:  Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0   Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  2. Recruitment Partners:  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics  3. Webinars:  We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

141 - 28 Dec 2023 03:01PM - +265 991 00 20 67: That's an excellent question. For starters, I see myself pursuing my studies further by becoming a medical student after graduating from my bachelor's in Cardiovascular Technology. Finally, being an Edoofian will help me in getting into schools that I would like to pursue my career in more easily. I also feel that being an Edoofian member will make it easier for me to reach out of my dreams in becoming a medical doctor.

Indian schooling has achieved worldwide acknowledgment with its recognized decent variety of character. Diversed educational planning bodies administer the institute instruction scheme in India. I have also researched that India has a publicly funded higher education system that is the third largest in the world.

153 - 28 Dec 2023 03:44PM - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
154 - 28 Dec 2023 04:17PM - +265 991 00 20 67: Allow me to first answer how I aim at achieving my career aspiration from studying in India. Firstly, studying in India is a privilege for me. However, I shall return to Malawi with a new perspective on culture, language skills, independence, and being a role model to many other children who have aspirations just like myself.  And to answer how studying in India will implement a positive impact on my career...Having to study India will enable me to get a job much easier and faster than expected after graduating.
155 - 28 Dec 2023 04:25PM - Kunal: Amazing! As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.  By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
156 - 28 Dec 2023 04:37PM - +265 991 00 20 67: I am aware of the fact that having a scholarship as an international student allows the student to concentrate on their careers and studies rather than worrying about how they will pay back their loans. Scholarships make it easier to pursue education and career goals by breaking barriers. What I am not aware of are the costs of being an international student without any scholarship. Can you please break it down for me.
157 - 28 Dec 2023 05:06PM - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

So, prior to answering the question, we need to discuss it as a family

166 - 28 Dec 2023 07:37PM - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the  *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

167 - 28 Dec 2023 07:37PM - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.   The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

42 - 28 Dec 2023 05:03PM - Kunal: Thank you for sharing I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

39 - 28 Dec 2023 04:41PM - Kunal: That is fine I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

61 - 28 Dec 2023 11:54AM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
62 - 28 Dec 2023 11:54AM - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

66 - 28 Dec 2023 10:57AM - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Mitchelle, Thank you for expressing your interest in pursuing dental courses. I would like to inform you that to pursue dentistry, clearing the National Entrance Eligibility Test (NEET) is a prerequisite, as it is one of the toughest exams globally for admission to dental courses. Unfortunately, our institution does not offer dentistry courses.  Considering this, I would appreciate it if you could share your alternate aspirations or areas of interest within the healthcare field. While dentistry may not be directly available, there are several healthcare-related courses that might align with your strong interests and aspirations. Exploring alternative paths within the medical field could provide you with fulfilling opportunities to contribute to healthcare and make a meaningful impact. And considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology*  *Bachelor of Physiotherapy*  *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology* Would you like me to explain any of these programs for you?

131 - 28 Dec 2023 01:38PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
132 - 28 Dec 2023 02:13PM - +263 77 967 5991: Ok thank you so much I understand it well and all I can say that its a good program an exclusive one

134 - 28 Dec 2023 02:41PM - Pallika Edoofa: Nigel, Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling: 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off  3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn  *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.  After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.

42 - 28 Dec 2023 05:54PM - +263 78 410 7432: I am Ngwenya Nomzamo , a student selected for the Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. Ofwhich it has been my dream to pursue  my studies  abroad due to the affordability  of fees and employment  opportunity as compared  to Zimbabwe where by the  colleges  and university  fees are expensive  as my parents  also struggled pay my school  fees during my days.And they can't  even raise that money for me to go and start my tertiary  education because  they are also paying for my younger brother  who is grade 6.  I attended  my Secondary  level at Bulu high where l found it enjoyable  to study fashion and fabrics thus where l gained more interest  to work as a fashion designer and also liked being a teacher because because  as a fashion designer  you can desion different  patterns   and sell,work as as a teacher  also l can open and operate my own company  maybe thus l will be aslo helping  my community by  exporting  some other clothes  to be sold  in my country  if its allowed.  Moreover ,since l had finished  my Secondary  level life has been stuck  since l have been applying  for other courses but not been shortlisted  for any.Therefore the fees now at colleges  rates to US $210per term which adds up to US $ 630 per year food exclusive, And to mention internet costs it adds up to $1000 per year.Therefore l find it better to study in India where by the fees are of less costs and has to access  to network the student's  education  is more  valuable.  I completed  my A Level in 2019 where l did Geography,Economics and Business Studies,I would  like to do Teaching in Fashion and Designing. My parents have  no professions as  my mother is just at home seated and my father does piece jobs in South Africa.My mother's  highest education  is form 3 in secondary level and my father in grade 7 in Primary level as  their parents  had no money  to pay for their fees.Yes l have got my sister who also do some piece jobs in South Africa to support   her 2 kids who are in Primary   level.Moreover my father is hs been so supportive  to me since l started my primary  as he has been doing  piece jobs to support  us.  It is my desire  to study abroad  and my sister is also willing and promising to be financially  supportive.Since my daddy in now at retirement  stage.And l also had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course,  which offer offers opportunity earnings  between $50 and $100.  Moreso,l attended  my O'Level and A'Level at Bulu High School   which is in Mangwe District  in Matebeleland South  province,thus where  my parents  paid a school fees which tated to US $190 per term to ensure  l had sufficient  internet

106 - 28 Dec 2023 11:55AM - Pallika Edoofa: Pretty, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.  So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
107 - 28 Dec 2023 11:56AM - +263 71 767 5128: No
108 - 28 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
109 - 28 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
110 - 28 Dec 2023 12:17PM - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.      *So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*

71 - 28 Dec 2023 12:30PM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Takunda, Let me tell you that we do not offer Actuarial science as a course, while Actuarial Science is indeed an independent and specialized degree program, there are certain aspects to consider that make a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) a favorable alternative for students While Actuarial Science is a field with a unique focus on risk management and financial security, the comprehensive nature of a BCom degree can offer a strong foundation for a successful and diverse career in various other sectors including risk management and financial security.   Shall I explain the course in depth?
72 - 28 Dec 2023 12:43PM - +263 77 771 3031: (Bcom) is a  good degree.I have looked into it and I also want to hear in depth so that I can fully understand
73 - 28 Dec 2023 12:43PM - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
93 - 28 Dec 2023 01:23PM - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
94 - 28 Dec 2023 01:23PM - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
95 - 28 Dec 2023 01:33PM - +263 77 771 3031: studying in Indian increase high chances of exposure to certain big enterprises which could make my career more interesting.The fact that Indian degree is recognised around the world makes it easier for someone to find a job and it has a greater advantage over someone with another degree.Studying in India also helps to reduce the problem of underemployment
96 - 28 Dec 2023 01:37PM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Takunda, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.  So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
97 - 28 Dec 2023 02:07PM - +263 77 771 3031: I'm not aware but I'm willing to be enlighted
98 - 28 Dec 2023 02:40PM - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay as I was having my lunch.
99 - 28 Dec 2023 02:40PM - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
100 - 28 Dec 2023 02:41PM - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
101 - 28 Dec 2023 02:41PM - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.     *So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
102 - 28 Dec 2023 02:56PM - +263 77 771 3031: I think they can manage.But I need a better clarification about reduced cost of education ($2000-$3000).How do they pay it ? at the end of the year or a start of the year or on monthly basis?",No,Yes

221 - 28 Dec 2023 11:06AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their Grade 12 result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final Grade 12 results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
222 - 28 Dec 2023 11:06AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?

163 - 28 Dec 2023 11:46AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Komborero! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.

You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.  Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?",No,No

With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
122 - 28 Dec 2023 01:05PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
123 - 28 Dec 2023 01:11PM - +263 71 427 9001: No ,my family cannot afford it

126 - 28 Dec 2023 02:33PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Salem. There are 6 months in a semester, please.

130 - 28 Dec 2023 02:46PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Salem. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.  With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.  So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?

164 - 28 Dec 2023 03:04PM - +263 71 427 9001: Yes thank you
165 - 28 Dec 2023 03:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I‚Äôll have to add that I‚Äôm flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
166 - 28 Dec 2023 03:21PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
167 - 28 Dec 2023 03:21PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
168 - 28 Dec 2023 03:25PM - +263 71 427 9001: Point 3
169 - 28 Dec 2023 03:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
178 - 28 Dec 2023 05:11PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your  - *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* - *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* - *Earn While You Learn Program and training* - *University sessions and interactions* - *A guaranteed scholarship seat* - *Visa Documentation Assistance* - *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
179 - 28 Dec 2023 05:15PM - +263 71 427 9001: Okay
180 - 28 Dec 2023 05:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
181 - 28 Dec 2023 05:20PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
182 - 28 Dec 2023 05:31PM - +263 71 427 9001: Oky thank you
183 - 28 Dec 2023 05:53PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?

I have taken the liberty of discussing this with the Academic Board, and we have come up with a suitable solution. Would it be convenient for you to discuss this further at your earliest convenience? Your cooperation is highly appreciated.
275 - 28 Dec 2023 05:30PM - +260 97 7848637: Yes.
276 - 28 Dec 2023 05:52PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I did discuss about Sepo's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Sepo's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.  Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
277 - 28 Dec 2023 05:58PM - +260 97 7848637: This is exciting news to us. But when could the 7 days start considering that her school results are not yet out.

178 - 28 Dec 2023 04:49PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
213 - 28 Dec 2023 07:10PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
214 - 28 Dec 2023 07:10PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

335 - 28 Dec 2023 01:52PM - Shubham Madhwal: @263784778884 you see the only reason I was seeking an update from you was. since I am well aware that in Zimbabwe there are severe Network Issues in Zimbabwe in a lot of regions because of which the bank sometimes faces server issues so in the past there have been parents who had to miss their deadline because their fees couldn't be completed on the same day of the due date, Instead, it took additional 2-3 days which delayed the overall progress of their child's admission.  As your counsellor, I can only recommend you to try and complete the formalities a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and you as parents do not have to be stressed regarding the same!  So if I may ask so far do you need my help with anything, please?

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways .

Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.

One of the contributing factors to this issue is the state of agriculture on the continent. Many smallholder farmers in Africa are confronted with outdated farming techniques, a lack of access to modern technologies, and limited resources, such as fertile land and adequate irrigation systems. As a result, agricultural yields in many parts of Africa are low, leading to food shortages and malnutrition. The lack of access to diverse and nutritious food sources is particularly detrimental to children, pregnant women, and other vulnerable groups. Additionally, the impact of climate change has further strained the agricultural sector in Africa, making it even more challenging for farmers to produce enough food to meet the demands of their communities. In conclusion, while it is true that many Africans suffer from food insecurity and poor nutrition due to inadequate agricultural practices, it is important to recognize that this problem is not solely caused by farmers. It is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach that includes investment in modern agricultural technologies, improved access to education and training, and increased support for smallholder farmers.""  Section 6  ""I used to believe that life was a series of impossible challenges. Like a puzzle with no solution, I struggled to see the bigger picture and understand my purpose. But one day, I decided to take a different approach. I began to look at each obstacle as an opportunity for growth and learning. I started to focus on the journey, rather than the destination. Every experience, good or bad, became a stepping stone to a better version of myself. As I embraced this new mindset, I found that my struggles became my greatest teachers. I learned to be resilient, to adapt and to find strength in adversity. Today, I stand before you, not as someone who has overcome all obstacles, but as someone who has learned to embrace them. I have discovered that life is not about reaching a final destination, but about growing and evolving. So I encourage you to embrace your own journey, and to see each challenge as an opportunity for growth. Remember, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.""",No,Yes

97 - 28 Dec 2023 12:28PM - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
98 - 28 Dec 2023 12:28PM - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa‚Äôs Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
99 - 28 Dec 2023 01:41PM - +263 77 634 2169: Physiotherapy is an essential component in the daily lives of people. Patients with a range of disabilities, stress related conditions as well as diseases related to spine depend on Physiotherapists.  As a prospective student in Physiotherapy, l have goals. In 5 years time, l see myself continuing in Physiotherapy and advancing in the career. By that time I hope to have attained the necessary physiotherapeutic skills to assist people mentioned earlier. Edoofa Program would not only enable me to attain an overseas degree, but it will also shape me into a professional that is able to assist his family and plant back into the community.
100 - 28 Dec 2023 03:04PM - Tushti: That is really great, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,  However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.  Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
101 - 28 Dec 2023 03:32PM - +263 77 634 2169: I promise you that

103 - 28 Dec 2023 03:43PM - +263 77 634 2169: India is known best for producing highest health care personnel and l would like to be an academic product of India.
104 - 28 Dec 2023 03:44PM - Tushti: That is correct
132 - 28 Dec 2023 04:18PM - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
133 - 28 Dec 2023 04:18PM - Tushti: <Media omitted>
134 - 28 Dec 2023 04:18PM - Tushti: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
135 - 28 Dec 2023 04:26PM - +263 77 634 2169: Edoofa is indeed helpful to many.
136 - 28 Dec 2023 04:29PM - +263 77 693 3511: Really India is a home for 'Education for All'. It's education system is all-inclusive. I appreciate the work done by the Edoofa to make education accessible to everyone.
137 - 28 Dec 2023 04:48PM - Tushti: Let me now brief you about the EWYL Program
138 - 28 Dec 2023 04:48PM - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
139 - 28 Dec 2023 04:48PM - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
140 - 28 Dec 2023 04:48PM - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

47 - 28 Dec 2023 12:51PM - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
48 - 28 Dec 2023 12:57PM - Tushti: Is this clear?

20 - 28 Dec 2023 12:03PM - +263 77 544 7266: I'm Shumirai Shoniwa a former student at Kutama Day High School located Zvimba , Mashonaland  West Province ,Zimbabwe. I was raised by maternal grandmother  in Zvimba rural area. My mother passed away  when l was at a very tender age , at the age of 3.My greatest strength is that I can prioritize what needs to be done first today and which tasks can wait until tomorrow. Because of this, I‚Äôm efficient with my time management and able to succeed in both school and extracurricular activities. However, my greatest weakness is that I can become too focused on one task and forget about other assignments or projects which need attention. I‚Äôve been working on this by setting reminders in my phone throughout the day. l enjoy netball because that was my sport at school

Educational level:  Ordinary level and Advanced Level 5 Subjects at Ordinary including: English,Science and Mathematics Advanced Level subjects: history, shona and divinity 3. Course to study: Nursing because it offers me an opportunity to help old peoples and children to live longer 4. My parent is a vendor in a growth point named Murombedzi 5.My parents level of education is standard six. 6.My grandmother and well wishers are the ones who supported my education 7. Yes l have siblings .they are at school primary level 8.I'm looking for scholarships to support my education 9. My fees per term was $50usd

27 - 28 Dec 2023 03:02PM - Tushti: Shumirai let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
28 - 28 Dec 2023 03:20PM - +263 77 544 7266: In that case I will apply for loan to cover expenses that are not covered by scholarship
29 - 28 Dec 2023 03:21PM - Tushti: Are you sure this would be financially feasible for the family?
