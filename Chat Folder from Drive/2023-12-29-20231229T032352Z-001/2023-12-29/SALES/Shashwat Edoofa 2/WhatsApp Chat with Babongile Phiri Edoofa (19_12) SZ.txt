Basically i have always had an interest in working in industries as im a person who is used to working under harsh conditions i thought to myself whynot work at the industries and help the local people of the country with something which i have assessed myself. Dealing with different kinds of chemicals is of my interest as i always wondered when doing experiments at school how some specific chemicals are manufactured and learning more about them would quite be the experience. Also due to the love of subject is why i would like to be a Chemical Engineer. If i manage to finish up my studies i can help my family responsibly and would make them proud. I believe this career of choice will help me invest in other companies as well and maybe one day i too could be a great leader and i would lead other people to perfection just as how i have been led to by a few mentors.

23/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 686 4148: okay Sir i will let you know
23/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 686 4148: it definetly is no clear and i understand more about the Indian community as well as economy thank you
23/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 686 4148: i have read all the information Mr Shashwat
23/12/23, 12:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India? <This message was edited>
23/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 686 4148: Studying in India would be really nice. As we know India is a respectible country and well kbown for its high educational qualities and it will be easier searching for a job as major companies which put a huge impact on our world economy and development are part of the Indian community so why not take their fellow community members who studied in India. It will be an easy access and a great opportunity in finding a job. India will be a an excellent recommendation throughout the world, this country is now known for a fast growing economy and a very rich cultural nature which allows people to accomodate each other well. Also many successfull people globally originate from India so it is a leeway for easier education as well as job finding. For a reputation of chemical engineering globally and as a wannabe chemical engineering student it would be a very much good job opportunity for me as well. Given the chance in working in these major companies or working in the local community one can always climb the ladder to greater education greater success as everything starts from the bottom then going up. I will study really hard in the subject engage in different sectors of the chemical engineering program interacting with people and through this forming a good relationship and this in turn producing more ideas of how to improve our world to greater lenghts.
23/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 71 686 4148: I believe as a person who would have studied in India it will be much easier to talk to people of higher education levels and allowing room to share ideas and this will also help me gaining more knowledge on my career improving my skills and i too giving some recommendations. In a way like this i would have achieved something as i get to talk to a lot of people improve my career capabilities through career guidance and the sharing of ideas from people with higher education
23/12/23, 1:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Babongile. India is home to several prominent chemical engineering companies that have made a remarkable impact on a global scale. Reliance Industries Limited, a conglomerate with diverse business interests, including petrochemicals and refining, stands as a key player in the global chemical industry. Tata Chemicals, part of the Tata Group, contributes significantly to various chemical manufacturing processes with a global reach. Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), primarily a consumer goods company, plays a role in the chemical sector, showcasing India's influence on global consumer markets. Larsen & Toubro (L&T), a major player in engineering, construction, and manufacturing, including the chemical sector, contributes to global infrastructure projects. Aditya Birla Group, with diverse business operations, has a strong presence in the global chemical industry. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), primarily an oil and gas company, is involved in petrochemical production, contributing to global energy and chemical markets. Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals (GSFC) is a significant player in fertilizers and chemicals, addressing global agricultural and industrial needs!
23/12/23, 1:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
23/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 686 4148: Indeed it even someone from a different state with a great ambition can call India home
23/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 686 4148: thank you so much, I must say im not really quite familiar with these platforms for someone without a scholarship. Except for the likes of Harvard University in American states whereby international students from there meaning the local people say it is quite the cost
23/12/23, 1:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Babongile! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2700-$3700 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation <This message was edited>
23/12/23, 1:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: To understand better, the cost of education($2700- $3800)per year that includes the remaining tuition fees, food, and accommodation expenses. This cost is paid in two equal installments. Each installment is paid before a semester. There are two semesters in a year
23/12/23, 1:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
23/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 686 4148: ohh okay Sir i hear and understand you
23/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 686 4148: currently my parents are out of range and are in a place without network connections ill ask them in advance while waiting for their response. May i update you when they become of reach <This message was edited>
23/12/23, 2:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Babongile. I will be waiting for your response, please.
23/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 686 4148: thank you for considering my request i really appreciate it Sir
23/12/23, 3:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Babongile. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?

26/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 71 686 4148: yes i have had the discussion with my parents. All is well they said they could manage
26/12/23, 10:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Babongile!
26/12/23, 10:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge this message, please?
26/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 686 4148: I think while studying ill be given the opportunity for a part time job while studying and throughout the course of the year students will be offerred attachment jobs for the very same course that student will be doing
26/12/23, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Babongile. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
26/12/23, 10:25 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
26/12/23, 10:25 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
26/12/23, 10:25 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
26/12/23, 10:25 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
26/12/23, 10:25 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
26/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 686 4148: i understand and finally gained some knowledge thank you
26/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 686 4148: This is very beneficial Sir. This will be of help and it offers even more diverse learning structures and an opportunity of learning more things and gaining more experience will be great. This will be beneficial for me
26/12/23, 10:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $140-$150 a month
26/12/23, 10:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
26/12/23, 10:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $3000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1500 in the first semester and $1500 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
26/12/23, 10:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

26/12/23, 10:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
26/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 71 686 4148: Wow! this is very impressive Sir. I see that this Earn While You Learn Program is very beneficial to most people and helpful.
26/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 686 4148: Yes i realize that it really helps relieve the financial pressure on my parents
26/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 686 4148: This will be a great experience in honing individual skills as well
26/12/23, 11:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
26/12/23, 11:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
26/12/23, 11:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
26/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 686 4148: personally i appreciate the first point the most as this helps in students gaining higher education. Quite a great opportunity
26/12/23, 11:33 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
26/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 686 4148: They feel really impressed and are proud they feel enthusiastic and are curious of what will happen in the future
26/12/23, 12:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
26/12/23, 12:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
26/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 71 686 4148: yes Sir leaving them stress free
26/12/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 686 4148: An application form is required, when one i writing why they are applying for the scholarship

A Purpose statement in which an individual writes in detail why they are applying for the scholarship explaining theirselves(character wise),their qualifications, aspirations in life basically why they want the scholarship

A Recommendation, getting reference from higher ups of education such as the authorities from school recommending their qualities, behaviour and why they want to study abroad
26/12/23, 12:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
26/12/23, 12:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
26/12/23, 12:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 12:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

26/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 686 4148: okay i undestand Sir
26/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 686 4148: This is very helpful, so these payments are covered by the Edoofa Program?
26/12/23, 12:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
26/12/23, 12:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
26/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 71 686 4148: okay its understandable. So this counselling day will it be on the 30th of December?
26/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 686 4148: This is better it relieves both stress on the parents as well as the children its is very much appreciable and it establishes a friendly environment with the program
26/12/23, 12:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly reframe your question, please?
26/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 686 4148: The Phase 1 enrollment process is it on the 30 December or it is scheduled for another date
26/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 686 4148: Will there be any person to person interactions?
26/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Babongile. Currently, we are engaged in a counseling session. Subsequently, following the conclusion of the session, the parents will partake in a video call with the Program Director, during which an interview will be conducted as part of the process!
26/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 686 4148: Wow! Its good to know that im in a session. Okay Sir i understand that there will be a session with the parents. It will be a good experience
26/12/23, 1:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Babongile! So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
26/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 686 4148: What i learnt about the financial aspects is that it may be of a challenge but it is made affordable due to the Earn While Learning Program which offers a stress free life for both parents and students. The program offers good scholarship credits and good mentorship which hone students in practical skills and helping them gain some good credits
26/12/23, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2700-$3700 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
26/12/23, 1:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 686 4148: thank you Sir
26/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 686 4148: We have discussed phases 1,2,3,4
26/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 686 4148: Currently im on the second stage
26/12/23, 2:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
26/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 686 4148: Yes, may you please explain
26/12/23, 2:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
26/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 686 4148: Yes im clear with the process
26/12/23, 2:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

28/12/23, 9:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Gconiwe!
28/12/23, 9:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
28/12/23, 9:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
28/12/23, 9:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
28/12/23, 9:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 4th or 5th January 2024 for $200 and the 4th or 5th of February for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 4th or 5th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
28/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 411 4927: I would like to opt for number 1 and I'm financially prepared for the same
