(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video to go through and learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.

How was your experience?
16/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 313 0804: Well my experience was brilliant considering that l had a lot of things that l didn't have clarity on Edoofa but as soon as l saw the video a lot of things went more clearer.
16/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 313 0804: I really appreciate all the speakers for imparting a positive mindset in my line of thinking

16/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Gerald, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Panashe!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
16/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Edoofa is an organization whose vision is not just to get you admission in a prestigious university, Edoofa stays with you for the course of your academic life 3-5 years.
16/12/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 313 0804: I learnt that at Edoofa we share an aim to make quality higher education accessible, affordable and most importantly employment oriented so that more and more students can pursue their dreams.
16/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have awareness, Gerald.
16/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
16/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okay thank you so much Mrs Harmehak for the educative information
16/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
16/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
16/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Yes we are already finacially challenged at home so l am looking forward to such opportunities
16/12/23, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
16/12/23, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Gerald, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Mazowe high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
16/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 313 0804: I am a boy aged 18. I live in Southerton, Harare. I finished writing my upper 6 final exams last month. Both my parents are still alive and we live together, both my parents are self employed . My father drives lorries for a living and my mother runs a canteen near the industries in my area. They both stopped schooling after A level. I am the third born child having an older sister who stopped schooling after finishing A level, the second one is currently at Women's University right now doing her first year, and two other younger siblings in primary school. I did my form 1 to 6 at Mazowe where our termly boarding fees was 500USD . l passed my O levels with 7A's and 4 B's and went on to do my A levels. I was a very active student in all my disciplines at school and had several leadership roles like Leo Club president, Scripture Union Vice Chairman, and School Head boy. Despite having challenges financially at home and going to school short of fees sometimes, l managed to pull through. I intend to become an electrical engineer and pursue my education further outside the country

18/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Oh that's wonderful.

Yes please, students would be coming to India in August 2024 as well.
18/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Are you motivated to join them?
18/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 78 313 0804: Yes l am, l really want to join them
18/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
18/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Well Gerald now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
18/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 313 0804: I feel like it would be a breakthrough , l don't want to keep on complaining about our financial disabilities, but instead l want to change the situation at home
18/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: I can understand Gerald and I am glad you are making efforts.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
18/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 313 0804: Yes l am a guy who is very much interested into travelling and living on my own🥲
18/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 313 0804: And l think a life abroad would help me improve me be more responsible in life. 🙂 as l will learn to stand on my own
18/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Gerald, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
18/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 313 0804: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: I am glad you have such supportive parents and family, Gerald.

So what other countries did you happen to apply please?
18/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 313 0804: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

I do understand, Gerald
18/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Now, I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
18/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 78 313 0804: Yes l am confident that l made it in my exams maam
18/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: I appreciate, Gerald.
18/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 313 0804: Thank you maam
18/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Electrical engineering?
18/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
18/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 313 0804: Okay let me do so right away
18/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Sure please
18/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 313 0804: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: You stated Maths, Physics and Computer Science please?
18/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Yes ma'am
18/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please
18/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: So now let me brief you about your desired course.
18/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering* is a 4 years degree course. Electrical engineering is one of the most sought-after branches of engineering

Electrical engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism for the development and maintenance of electrical and electronics equipment. Electrical Engineering course study includes Circuit analysis, machines & drive system, Power System, Control system, Power electronics, Utilization etc. The main focus of the course will be on industrial requirement of ‘Electrical engineering’.

The scope for students of B. Tech Electrical Engineering is very high. There are two options available for them either they can join higher education after this course or they can join their professional career as per skills. At present, electrical engineers have great demand in the market.
 
An objective of this course is to ensure the success of the students for a long time. Students can develop their electrical skills and abilities with the study of this course. They also can improve abilities of professional attitude, effective communication skills as well.

Apart from that other sectors like MNC companies, IT companies, steel, cement, fertilizer, petrochemical, shipping, traction, automobile companies etc. can give them best job offers with high salary packages.
18/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okay noted ma'am thank you for the knowledge
18/12/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
18/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Alright Gerald, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams? <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Alright, in the next 5 years l see myself employed at a well reputable organisation be it in India or any other country and l see myself persuing  my masters education whilst working. If l get into Edoofas program , l will be able to excell in my education without my parents having to worry about my tuition fees, and l will also help those high school freshmen who were as disadvantaged as l am to find their way to succeed in life
18/12/23, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Gerald, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 313 0804: I want to study abroad because  my country has many economic hardships which are leading to lack of employment amongst graduates and youths nationwide. The other reason why l want to study abroad is because of the high levels of practical education in some developed countries which is a something that can help me cultivate good skillset and knowledge in my line of study so l become first preference class  where ever l will be based
18/12/23, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: You see, Gerald, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
18/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Very much so its best to seize an opportunity to go out when you get it.
18/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Especially looking at things right now we can't really tell what the future holds so securing your future is best
18/12/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Gerald.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
18/12/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: I would appreciate an active participation please
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okay maam
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: Please, Gerald.
18/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okay throughout my research l learnt that India is one of the most highly profound countries that give some of the highest quality education
18/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Many doctors, engineers and other professions from india are demanded by other countries because of the high quality skillset that India gives them
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 313 0804: So the Indian education system assists one person to be very very handyy not only theoretically but mostly on the practical side
18/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 313 0804: And also India has one of the best top leading companies in the world , with a wide variety of products
18/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 313 0804: So therefore studying in India would help me gain enough qualifications for me to advance throughout my education and day to day running
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have awareness and knowledge, Gerald.
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

18/12/23, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
18/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 313 0804: No ma'am we are not
18/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 313 0804: I actually want to be enlightened more on that but l heard that it is cheap. But being cheap does not mean some families can afford it that l am aware
18/12/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
18/12/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okayy
18/12/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okay ma'am l am following you
18/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okayy l see that India is much cheaper than the other western countries
18/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Gerald.
18/12/23, 4:00 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
18/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 313 0804: So it means we have to pay off the remaining balance?
18/12/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
18/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okay l see
18/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 313 0804: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 313 0804: I think this is a very very good opportunity for students. So students will be actually working whilst learning to reduce their costs
18/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Its very clear and makes sense thank you
18/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 313 0804: This message was deleted
18/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

However, you can reduce the amount with the Earn While You Learn Program.
18/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
18/12/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: Gerald, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
18/12/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okay
18/12/23, 5:57 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Yes l agree with you
18/12/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Gerald?
18/12/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Yes l am maam
18/12/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Very much indeed
18/12/23, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
18/12/23, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/12/23, 6:10 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 313 0804: 😁 yese ma'am l can see the EWYL
18/12/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: Thats great, Denzel!
18/12/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 313 0804: I would love to participate in one of these programs too
18/12/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Its Gerald
18/12/23, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: You would definitely get a chance and that too from Zimbabwe itself, Gerald!
18/12/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okay l understand it now
18/12/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okay maam
18/12/23, 6:21 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/12/23, 6:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: Well that's wonderful, Gerald.

I am glad you are thoroughly following every resource.
18/12/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Yes maam
18/12/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
18/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Yes l.am
18/12/23, 6:31 pm - Harmehak: Gerald, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
18/12/23, 6:31 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/12/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 313 0804: A minimum of $1500
18/12/23, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/12/23, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/12/23, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: You see Gerald, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Yes l do
18/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 313 0804: I think so
18/12/23, 6:36 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/12/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
18/12/23, 6:37 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/12/23, 6:40 pm - +263 78 313 0804: I understand but l don't think my parents have enough money to pay for the $350 fee 😞
18/12/23, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: Its paid after you are found eligible for the program, Gerald and once you receive an Acceptence letter!

*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/12/23, 6:41 pm - Harmehak: I hope you are firstly clear with the purpose of the Enrollment fee?
18/12/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okayy l know understand maam🌚👍🏾
18/12/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 313 0804: 🫂 I thought you pay it before
18/12/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
18/12/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: I understand, however that is not the case.
18/12/23, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
18/12/23, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
18/12/23, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/12/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Yes ma'am l did understand
18/12/23, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/12/23, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
18/12/23, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
18/12/23, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
18/12/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

18/12/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 313 0804: Okayy
18/12/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth too.
18/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
18/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
18/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “19-12-23” at 10:30 P.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable.

19/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 313 0804: Thanks
19/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Gerald and dear parents, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
19/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 313 0804: Yes we can
19/12/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: So Gerald, may I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?

19/12/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: I appreciate,

19/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 313 0804: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: That's great
19/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: I have received one question,

Is there anything else they would like to ask please?
19/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 313 0804: No not at all
19/12/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$450, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations.
19/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 313 0804: Okay understood ma'am
19/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Duly noted,

Meanwhile would you like to ask anything else please?
19/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 313 0804: Thank you l don't have anymore further questions ma'am
19/12/23, 11:02 am - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023!

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE

Section 6 

If there is one thing that still runs vividly in my mind, it would be the eternity happiness I felt that day. Being a person who does not believe in fairytales, the unfolding of such a huge step in my life was ironically a fairytale indeed. Being announced as the Head boy of Mazowe high school came with great privilege, honor, dignity and immense loyalty. This was definitely one of my mother’s prayers that had been answered. It marked the lifting of one curtain in my life to a scene where I got to be a leader and a role model to many and all l could say was God did!

The utterance of my mother’s mouth became reality. That is when l believed that words are powerful, what was once mere speculation can become certain the moment it is verbalized. It was now a call for me to act different and lead by example as I became the face of the school. My friends, family and associates rejoiced over the news of me being the Head boy of an institution such as Mazowe High School. Improving my personality was now a norm as l learnt to act more responsibly and stopped being pessimistic certain about things. I am not that good of a speaker, especially in front of a huge crowd but with time l can do it just like a baby learning how to walk from the point it starts crawling.

However, l was a very short tempered young man but with this change l reciprocated my personality and became someone who tolerates people for their different characters even if it depreciates my account. Being the leader of over 700 boys takes a lot to adjust. l am now very good at delegating duties to my prefects board as teamwork is my motto. Delegation is a key aspect especially if one is to lead a group of people with different personalities. To be a better leader, one has to analyse the characters of the people they deal with and later give judgement. New issues and problems arise everyday but there is always a solution to these hardships. The solution comes about after you push your mind into deeper meditation. I learnt how to solve problems though it was difficult at first. The first step towards problem solving are good socializing skills. My socializing skills improve everyday as I get the chance to interact with people of different ages, gender, occupations and other things that make up a human being.

Furthermore, my listening skills have also improved because day by day I get to hear other people’s opinions and then negotiate after. A lot of pressure can build on me, but I never fail to balance my schoolwork, sporting activities and duties. I realized that consideration of alternative solutions and justification of one against others can help me remove pressure. The spirit of hard work possessed me as l am at a point that requires me to increase my effort in everything that l do. This implies that l should push myself in order to start moving forward as newton’s first law of motion says “a body will continue in its state of rest unless acted upon by an external force”.

Also in addition to the above, spiritual growth as a Christian is really important to me. I am persuing my Christian life and using my privileges as l get to preach to others and motivate them in times of need. A good leader does not give up easily, he or she stands by an institution in difficult times and finds alternative solutions to problems in their control. What you do for yourself does not matter. The point is what you do for others <This message was edited>

Topic: Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient?

It is not accurate to claim that many Africans have poor diets solely because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. While there are challenges in agriculture across the African continent, it is important to recognize that the causes of poor diets are multifaceted and cannot be attributed solely to farm productivity. Several factors contribute to the dietary challenges in Africa and this include poverty, limited access to markets, inadequate infrastructure, lack of agricultural inputs, political instability and climate change. These issues often result in limited food choices, inadequate nutrition and food insecurity. 

To commerce, poverty is a major factor that contributes to poor diets in Africa. Many individuals and families cannot afford to purchase a diverse range of nutritious foods, leading to a reliance on cheaper, less nutritious options. This clearly proves that farms cannot be solely blamed for the poor diets in the African continent.

Furthermore, limited access to markets can be a challenge that can lead to poor dietary ways in Africa. Inadequate transportation infrastructure and limited market access in rural areas make it difficult for farmers to sell their products and for consumers to access a variety of fresh nutritious foods. This fact showcases that farms are not only to blame for the poor diets in Africa.

More so, cultural and behavioral preferences can also contribute to poor diets. Traditional diets may lack diversity or be high in unhealthy ingredients, leading to nutritional deficiencies or diet-related diseases. This enlightens on the fact that farms cannot be blamed for the poor diets in Africa. 

In conclusion, efforts are being made by the governments, organizations, and individuals to address these challenges and improve agricultural productivity, promote sustainable farming practices, enhance infrastructure and increase access to markets. These initiatives aim to improve food security, nutrition and overall well-being in African communities.

20/12/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
20/12/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
20/12/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

20/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28 th December 2023 for $200 and the  27th or 28th of January for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th December 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
20/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 313 0804: I would like to opt for option 1
