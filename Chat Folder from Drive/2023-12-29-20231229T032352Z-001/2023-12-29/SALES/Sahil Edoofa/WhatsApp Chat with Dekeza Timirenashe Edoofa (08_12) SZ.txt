11/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 949 9509: Okay
11/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 949 9509: Am through

The education is of high quality emphasising Research and, innovation, Research where students can collaborate with experts from Industry, this prepares graduates from University to fit well in the world of work. I appreciated funding opportunities scholarships, loans and bursaries this helps students from poor backgrounds to realise their academic goals.
11/12/23, 10:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
11/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 949 9509: Yes I am interested in studying in India. I have seen that India has a strong Agricultural sector and pursuing   a programme in Agriculture I will gain hands on experience through attachment and mentorship programmes. I may also be fortunate to get a scholarship which will easy my financial burden and focus on my studies
11/12/23, 10:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
11/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 949 9509: I am not familiar with fees structure for international students with no scholarship , may you assist
11/12/23, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Timirenashe! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
11/12/23, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
11/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 949 9509: No it is not affordable
11/12/23, 11:22 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
11/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 949 9509: 2000
11/12/23, 11:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Timirenashe. Pursuing tertiary education abroad requires financial planning. May I know whether your family has contrived a financial plan for the respective decision?
11/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 949 9509: On Financial planning it, the family will look at possible projects to raise funds
11/12/23, 12:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed more light on the matter, please?
11/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 949 9509: On Financial planning it, the family will look at possible projects to raise funds
11/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 949 9509: The family is considering ordering and selling second hand clothing, gardening and poultry farming
11/12/23, 1:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Timirenashe. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
11/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 949 9509: No I don't have any idea
11/12/23, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Timirenashe. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/12/23, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/12/23, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/12/23, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
11/12/23, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
11/12/23, 1:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
11/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 949 9509: Yes I think it will benefit
11/12/23, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
11/12/23, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
11/12/23, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
11/12/23, 2:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

11/12/23, 2:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
11/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 949 9509: Thus great
11/12/23, 3:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge this question?
11/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 949 9509: Yes sir thank you
11/12/23, 3:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is good to know, Timirenashe. May I know whether you think it is affordable now, please? <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 949 9509: Yes sir it is affordable
11/12/23, 3:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
11/12/23, 3:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
11/12/23, 3:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
11/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 390 2651: Point 4 is more appealing
11/12/23, 4:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mr. Clayton! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have their backs!
11/12/23, 4:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how you feel about Timirenashe studying abroad?
11/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 390 2651: As his father I support his wish to study abroad
11/12/23, 4:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
11/12/23, 4:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
11/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 390 2651: Thus fine
11/12/23, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
11/12/23, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
11/12/23, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 5:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
11/12/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 949 9509: Point 4 is more appealing
11/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information, please?
11/12/23, 8:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 12:53 am - +263 77 390 2651: Noted, the problem is power, we experience long hours of power cut
12/12/23, 9:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step." - Lao Tzu*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
12/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 390 2651: Morning can start
12/12/23, 9:34 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Clayton!
12/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 390 2651: Certainly
12/12/23, 9:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Timirenashe! It's heartening to know that as an Edoofian, you can always count on the unwavering support that we, here at Edoofa, provide!
12/12/23, 9:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Clayton. May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
12/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 390 2651: Yes I do
12/12/23, 9:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
12/12/23, 9:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
12/12/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 390 2651: Understood
12/12/23, 10:04 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
12/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 390 2651: Yes like other African countries Zimbabwe is facing economic challenges that 7 days within which to pay fees is not feasible bt as u indicated I appreciate the flexible payment plan, that we can  make effort
12/12/23, 10:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
12/12/23, 10:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 390 2651: We are on stage 1 personalised counselling which has gone on well
12/12/23, 10:29 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
12/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 390 2651: Noted
12/12/23, 10:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
12/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 390 2651: Thank you
12/12/23, 12:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

14/12/23, 11:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
14/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 390 2651: I got to understand point 7 that after getting an offer letter my son has to pay registration fee for the process of selection and that the place is reserved. This registration fees will b part of the semester/term fees. My response is that we are agreeable
14/12/23, 11:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mr. Clayton. Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
14/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 390 2651: Voice notes taking time to send because of poor connectivity
14/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 390 2651: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 11:44 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
14/12/23, 11:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
14/12/23, 11:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
14/12/23, 11:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 11:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 21st or 22nd December 2023 for $200 and the 21st or 22nd of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 21st or 22nd December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
14/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 390 2651: Well said
14/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 390 2651: Thus great
14/12/23, 12:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the message, please?
14/12/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 390 2651: The first one where $200 will  b paid by 22nd Dec and bal by 22 January 2023. Financial stability not sound but we will make an effort to pay
14/12/23, 12:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 390 2651: Voice notes taking time
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Mr. Clayton. I will be waiting for your response.
14/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 390 2651: Ok
14/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 390 2651: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Considering that you have provided comprehensive answers to all the inquiries, the next step in the process involves scheduling a video call with the Program Director. Once I submit the evaluation report for the application of Timirenashe, I will promptly arrange suitable time slots for the video call. Could I inquire about your availability for tomorrow to proceed with this arrangement?
14/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 390 2651: Think between 9 and 12 will b available
14/12/23, 2:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether 9:30 A.M. CAT is convenient for you, please?

Also, make the necessary preparations for a video call. Please note that the director will only conduct the interview once, and missing it may lead to application cancellation. Best of luck!

*"The only person who is educated is the one who has learned how to learn and change." - Carl Rogers*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
16/12/23, 9:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you *Mr. Clayton Dekeza , Mrs. Sannah Dekeza and Dekeza Timirenashe’s*,

*I am Sahil, the Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* 

I have been actively involved in evaluating your application since the beginning of your sessions with our dedicated counselor. I must express my admiration for your commitment to supporting your child's higher education, a sentiment echoed not only in your application but also in the positive feedback received from your school authorities.

Having closely followed your journey, I am pleased to inform you that your interview was impressive, and I personally advocated for your selection during discussions with the Academic Board. Your dedication and enthusiasm have played a significant role in securing your eligibility for the scholarship.
16/12/23, 9:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Heartiest congratulations to you and your family, *Mr. Clayton Dekeza and Mrs. Sannah Dekeza as Dekeza Timirenashe’s* application was found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I have been so happy and excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage 👏🏽👏🏽.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
16/12/23, 9:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/12/23, 5:46 am - +263 77 390 2651: Good morning was not reachable because of power problem its raining heavily so electricity went off. We  accept the offer will download the offer and go through once electricity is back
18/12/23, 11:38 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
18/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 949 9509: Good and you sir
18/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 390 2651: I am doing well and you
18/12/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you and your family go through your acceptance letter ?
18/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 390 2651: Yes we did
18/12/23, 2:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So far do you have any questions for me ?
18/12/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 390 2651: Sorry was off line electricity problem, so far no question
18/12/23, 7:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
18/12/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 949 9509: Yes sir
18/12/23, 8:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
18/12/23, 8:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC
