I would like to inform you that to pursue dentistry, clearing the National Entrance Eligibility Test (NEET) is a prerequisite, as it is one of the toughest exams globally for admission to dental courses. Unfortunately, our institution does not offer dentistry courses.

Considering this, I would appreciate it if you could share your alternate aspirations or areas of interest within the healthcare field. While dentistry may not be directly available, there are several healthcare-related courses that might align with your strong interests and aspirations. Exploring alternative paths within the medical field could provide you with fulfilling opportunities to contribute to healthcare and make a meaningful impact. And considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
