22/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 767 5128: 🤨Natasha❓
22/12/23, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse for this, Pretty, 
I was referring to my another student.
22/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 767 5128: I have already addressed them
22/12/23, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Pretty, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
22/12/23, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

22/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 767 5128: Yes I did

28/12/23, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Pretty, You did answer the relatable question but that was before the information was shared, and now as you are aware of India so, I was concerned about knowing a few facts.
28/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 71 767 5128: Ooh sorry I didn't understand
28/12/23, 11:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Please address that

28/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 71 767 5128: No
28/12/23, 12:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 12:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 12:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.





*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
