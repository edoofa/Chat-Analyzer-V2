*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Ruvangu Sungano. 

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. 

(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video to go through and learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.
