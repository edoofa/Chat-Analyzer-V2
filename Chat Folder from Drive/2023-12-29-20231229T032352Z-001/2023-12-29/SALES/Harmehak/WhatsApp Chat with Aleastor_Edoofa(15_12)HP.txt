We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
27/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 001 2193: Yes we can start
27/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the shared document, Aleastor?
27/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 001 2193: Yes
27/12/23, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
27/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 001 2193: l understand that Roofs program can help by processing Visa application  for the student , Also the student has the right to choose the college or university he /she wants to go where they can afford , And there are different type of schoolarship, the one l know is fully funded schoolarship , it is the most schoolarship most african students wants but it is given to students who are excellent, this is what l learnt of the Edoofa program
27/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: This is your understanding of the document, Aleastor?
27/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 001 2193: Yaaa this is it
27/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 001 2193: But this is not all
27/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly read the document, Aleastor?
27/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: Sure please, 

You can add more.
27/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 001 2193: l didn't read all the pages
27/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind the same please?
27/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 001 2193: I wanted to read bit by bit so that i can understand everything
27/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: I do understand,

Meanwhile, did you discuss with your parents too?
27/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 001 2193: Yes
27/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: What all did you discuss with them yesterday?
27/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 001 2193: My mom is in this group so all the conversation we have talked they saw it and they know everything
27/12/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: That's good,

So far do you understand the following?
27/12/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 001 2193: Oky its clear
27/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries?
27/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 001 2193: Haa not yet
27/12/23, 11:48 am - Harmehak: Alright and have you discussed the finances with your parents too?
27/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 001 2193: No let me show them
27/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!

Did you discuss with them now?
27/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 001 2193: Yes
27/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: What did you discuss with them now Aleastor?

Do they have any queries for me?
27/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 001 2193: I told them how you operate and i gave them the pdf you sent for them to read and know more about you
27/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 001 2193: For now they have non.

27/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Aleastor, given the finances are they willing to support you with roughly $1500 a year?
27/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 001 2193: Yes them have agreed
27/12/23, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: Can they acknowledge the same using a voice note, Aleastor? <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 229 6131: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please,

I appreciate your support for Aleastor.
27/12/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
27/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 229 6131: Thank you.
27/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
27/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Moving forward, do ensure active participation, Aleastor?
27/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 001 2193: Oky
27/12/23, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same?
27/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 001 2193: Yes l go through it
27/12/23, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study your desired course?
