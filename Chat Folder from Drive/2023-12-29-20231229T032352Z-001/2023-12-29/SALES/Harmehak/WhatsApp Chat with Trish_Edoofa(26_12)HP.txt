28/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 78 190 1631: Tanzania
28/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Alright please
28/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: I believe he has been following the discussion so you request him to participate.
28/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 190 1631: Sure,
28/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
28/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 190 1631: But I’m an ordinary level graduate
28/12/23, 11:36 am - Harmehak: You completed O level when please?
28/12/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 190 1631: This year
28/12/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: So you are yet to receive your O level results?
28/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 190 1631: Yes
28/12/23, 11:38 am - Harmehak: Alright Trish
28/12/23, 11:39 am - Harmehak: You happened to mention your year of A level as 2024

May I know more about the same?
28/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 190 1631: Well I don’t want to do my A level here I want to study there for my A level or I’d like to get an exam for my admission and study law
28/12/23, 11:48 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Trish.

So are you aware that you would be proceeding ahead on the basis of a Diploma right after O level?
28/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 190 1631: Yes
28/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Duly noted

28/12/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

So did you ever participate in debate competitions?
28/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 190 1631: **

Never,
28/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright
28/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 190 1631: The problem is I can’t speak right from head when arguing I need time to figure out the points to bring when arguing and write them down
28/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: That's understandable, 

I am glad you are thoroughly aware of your strengths and weakness.
28/12/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: You see since right after O level, you can pursue Diploma itself, So students firstly pursue Diploma in Business Administration after the same you pursue Bachelors in Business Administration - Legislative Law.

As Law is a Bachelor's degree and can be pursued After A level or Diploma.
28/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 190 1631: After Diploma

So are you prepared to do the same?
28/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 190 1631: * 
Yes but how long does it take
28/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: The Diploma is of three years, Trish.
28/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 190 1631: What about studying law
28/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Law is a 5 year degree please
28/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 190 1631: So it’d be 8 years right?
28/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 190 1631: So is it possible to take a break and go back home?
