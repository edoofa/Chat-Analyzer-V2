And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
28/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 672 7530: *Personal information*

To begin with age,lm a boy at the age of 22. I did my Ordinary level in Harare Zimbabwe at a school named Hatcliffe High under a Capernaum scholarship, l was the senior prefect during my form 2 course and later levelled up to be the Vice Headboy of the school. At form four l registered 10 subjects and came out with 8 of them. I proceeded to A-level persuing the field of Arts. At this period life became a bit binding and squeezing l had to work and balance school as l needed an upkeep. I wrote my Zimsec examinations and sat on 5 points. I accepted the fate, lost my scholarship and met a gentleman who offered to pay for my first semester at the University of Zimbabwe having applied and approved to take the Honours Degree in Special Needs and Assistive technology under the faculty of Education. I was hoping to have find a job which would assist raise my fees at the end of the semester but it was to know avail so when l heard about the Edoofa scholarship program l was excited that my God had done it again for me.

*Family Background*
I was born in a family of six children, both parents passed away after me and my twin were done with our primary education level. Our sister and the big elder brothers are still there but they are not eligible to help. My twin dropped school at form four and went to work but l felt l had a dream to persue, a degree to carry under my name. Something was driving hard inside of me to hold on with school.

I'm currently living under the roof of my Pastor and his family

*If there be any specific information not stated, l will be happy to respond*
28/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: I am very sorry for your loss, Munashe.

I understand how difficult things must have been.
28/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 672 7530: It's a phase, l have learnt that one can not be a King with a history to tell. All that happened or is happening is helping to build up my story, build a strong inner me and helping me testify the goodness of God at the end
28/12/23, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Munashe, I am glad you came out stronger.
28/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 672 7530: It is the Lord's doing, He doesn't bring to us tasks that we can't tackle but the purpose is to familiarize the tasks with us
28/12/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: I understand
28/12/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: So are you currently working itself, Munashe?
28/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 672 7530: I'm not working, lm just at home
28/12/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
28/12/23, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Munashe, considering your understanding,

Even if you are offered 100% scholarship on tuition fee after evaluation of the results are other merits,

How are you planning to cater for the remaining expenses?
28/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 672 7530: What expenses are we talking about?
28/12/23, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: Could you please highlight yourself for me considering other than Tuition fee that are there while you study abroad?
28/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 672 7530: We said Tuition covers, fees, accommodation and food right.

We can talk of the flight fees, passports, clothes, etc...

I need guidance
28/12/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: Are you clear that Edoofa offers Scholarship on tuition fee itself, Munashe?
28/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 672 7530: [12/28, 12:56] Mneey: Tuition and fees paid up to date during the course of my career, meaning l will be having the fees paid, accommodation and or plus food......lf lm wrong l stand to be corrected
[12/28, 12:59] +91 98717 82922: You are correct.
28/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 672 7530: I'm now lost please try make things clear
28/12/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Excuse me for the same.
28/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
28/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 672 7530: Then how do l get the sponsorship
28/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 672 7530: Because definitely if lm to go under scholarship l will need employment
28/12/23, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers scholarship itself Munashe.
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 672 7530: Alright l understand
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: You cannot work in India on a student visa please.
28/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 672 7530: I have understood all the terms and conditions now
28/12/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
28/12/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Now do you have any queries for me?
28/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 672 7530: Can you offer help in finding sponsorship
28/12/23, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: I shall inform you if I come across one, Munashe.

However currently I donot have any contact please.
28/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 672 7530: It's okay no further queries
28/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 672 7530: Thank you for the good time we had
28/12/23, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
28/12/23, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: Let me then close your application in such a case. Feel free to re-apply when you are both mentally and financially ready to come to India for your higher education. However, in case you come across any of your friends or family members who would like to study abroad for their higher education, please share the following document with them and ask them to read it. After reading if they wish to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you can share my number and ask them to fill out the application form and share the filled application with me.
