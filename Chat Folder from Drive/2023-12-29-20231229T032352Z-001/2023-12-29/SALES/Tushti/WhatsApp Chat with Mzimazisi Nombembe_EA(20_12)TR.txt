26/12/23, 1:40 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
26/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Yes its quite challenging for them
26/12/23, 5:33 pm - Tushti: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you  again at *09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

26/12/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Noted with thanks, God bless you too
27/12/23, 9:23 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
27/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 634 2169: Good morning
27/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 634 2169: Yes we can start
27/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 693 3511: Good morning Ms Tushti
27/12/23, 10:26 am - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
27/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 693 3511: We have a  poultry project that supplements the  salary.
27/12/23, 10:40 am - Tushti: Would the family be able to raise around $2000 per year for the tuition fee?
27/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 634 2169: Even though they are struggling to raise our school fees, one or the other they would manage to get through. They kero some chickens and sell to supplement their earnings. With the fees needed for higher education , well it depends with the amounts rquired
27/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 693 3511: Truly speaking anything above $1200 will unaffordable looking at the current situation.
27/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 693 3511: If we put aside $100 aside every month it's much affordable.
27/12/23, 11:00 am - Tushti: Well, is there anyone in the family who can provide financial assistance for the remaining part of the fee?
27/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 693 3511: I wish there was.  If our elder children were employed definitely we would manage to pour in together to raise the whole amount.  But currently we don't have anyone reliable to assist
27/12/23, 1:12 pm - Tushti: In that case, do you wish to withdraw this application?
27/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 693 3511: No. We don't wish to withdraw Mam. Attaining a scholarship for our son due to financial constraints had always been our wish.
27/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 693 3511: I'm kindly asking if you could adjust the required top_up amount if possible.
27/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 693 3511: ...to a figure that is lower than 2000usd.
27/12/23, 2:04 pm - Tushti: WE do have the EWYLProgram that helps the student self sponsor their education
27/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Okay Mam. How does this one work?
27/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Oh I have just checked on the EWYLProgram. If it's possible for our son to work and raise the remaining $800  while he learns we would really appreciate
27/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 634 2169: I would love to learn and work to reduce a burden from my parents
27/12/23, 3:07 pm - Tushti: However, if the student is unable to earn the amount, the family would have to pay
27/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Its alright. In that case we will have to go beyond our means. What we don't want is our son to lose this opportunity
27/12/23, 5:48 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Noted with thanks

28/12/23, 11:20 am - Tushti: Noted
28/12/23, 11:21 am - Tushti: Dear, I can see you have  a D in chemistry, I hope you shall get better grades in U6, since your scholarship percentage depends on it
28/12/23, 11:21 am - Tushti: Now, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
28/12/23, 11:21 am - Tushti: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
28/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 634 2169: That's my hope too
28/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 634 2169: Noted
28/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 634 2169: I can see that without Physics l can no longer take the course in medicine. I'll update you on which course I'll decide on in a few
28/12/23, 11:44 am - Tushti: Please choose a course from this list
28/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 634 2169: I've done some research and I've decided to take a course in Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy
28/12/23, 12:13 pm - Tushti: Noted
28/12/23, 12:14 pm - Tushti: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
28/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Noted thank you for the information
28/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Thank you for the information
28/12/23, 12:28 pm - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
28/12/23, 12:28 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
28/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Physiotherapy is an essential component in the daily lives of people. Patients with a range of disabilities, stress related conditions as well as diseases related to spine depend on Physiotherapists.  As a prospective student in Physiotherapy, l have goals. In 5 years time, l see myself continuing in Physiotherapy and advancing in the career. By that time I hope to have attained the necessary physiotherapeutic skills to assist people mentioned earlier. Edoofa Program would not only enable me to attain an overseas degree, but it will also shape me into a professional that is able to assist his family and plant back into the community.
28/12/23, 3:04 pm - Tushti: That is really great, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
28/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 634 2169: I promise you that
28/12/23, 3:37 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 634 2169: India is known best for producing highest health care personnel and l would like to be an academic product of India.
28/12/23, 3:44 pm - Tushti: That is correct
28/12/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

28/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Wow!
28/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Wow, this is all amazing and l would not want to miss the opportunity to be in such a democratic country with the 2nd largest number of scientists. Really, l would like to be mentored by such great minds.
28/12/23, 4:09 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
28/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Yes we are, it is expensive
28/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Oh yes we know. Ordinary people like us wouldn't manage to send our son to any international university without any financial assistance from well wishers like the Edoofa Program.
28/12/23, 4:16 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/12/23, 4:16 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/12/23, 4:18 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 4:18 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 4:18 pm - Tushti: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 634 2169: Edoofa is indeed helpful to many.
28/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 693 3511: Really India is a home for 'Education for All'. It's education system is all-inclusive. I appreciate the work done by the Edoofa to make education accessible to everyone.
28/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: Let me now brief you about the EWYL Program
28/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/12/23, 4:48 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
