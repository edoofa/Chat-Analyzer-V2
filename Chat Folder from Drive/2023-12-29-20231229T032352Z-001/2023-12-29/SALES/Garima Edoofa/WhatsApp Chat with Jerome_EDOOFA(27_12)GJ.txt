28/12/23, 10:53 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 278 9814: Yes I’ve been wondering

28/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 278 9814: I don’t understand do you mind explaining
28/12/23, 11:23 am - Garima Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, it is my lunch break and we'll be connecting shortly after One Hour.
28/12/23, 12:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: Good day, I am back from my lunch, shall we start?
28/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Yaa sure
28/12/23, 12:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate what you did not understood?
28/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Does it mean that after I am done with the program it will be easy for me to get a job in India?
28/12/23, 12:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Thank you for the question, Jerome, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying jobs!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
28/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Oky …. Thank you it’s now clear
28/12/23, 2:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Jerome, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
28/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 278 9814: 1) studying in India will give me a chance to focus on my studies without any distractions 

2)I feel like I will have an opportunity to work abroad
28/12/23, 2:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Jerome. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the students is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
28/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 278 9814: I have no idea
28/12/23, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
28/12/23, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/12/23, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Oky that is amazing… what about students who are on scholarships
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Jerome what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts on the same?
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on that?
28/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Ohh oky now I understand
28/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 278 9814: It’s very good
28/12/23, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
28/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Yes ma’am
28/12/23, 3:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/12/23, 3:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/12/23, 4:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
