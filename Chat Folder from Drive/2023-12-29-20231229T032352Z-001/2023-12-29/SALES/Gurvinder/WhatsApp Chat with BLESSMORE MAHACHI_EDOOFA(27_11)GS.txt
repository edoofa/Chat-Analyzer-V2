27/12/23, 8:18 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning BLESSMORE, Mr and Mrs MAHACHI!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
27/12/23, 9:01 am - +249 96 758 6108: Good morning  how are you
27/12/23, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs Dube,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
27/12/23, 9:56 am - +249 96 758 6108: Ok thank you for considering my  son for your program
27/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Please, there is no need to thank, let us continue the session now.
27/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs Dube, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Wessly, is that correct?
27/12/23, 10:04 am - +249 96 758 6108: That's correct my son got your information from him
27/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 71 877 0996: Good morning
27/12/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you Blessmore.
27/12/23, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Wessly, also do tell me whether you learnt about Wessly’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
27/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 877 0996: He told me that edoofa program is a scholarship program not a sponsorship program
27/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 877 0996: He also told me about the edoofa earn as you learn program which helps your students to earn some money whilst they learn
27/12/23, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me breif you more about the program.
27/12/23, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
27/12/23, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/12/23, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
27/12/23, 11:38 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
27/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 71 877 0996: Yes thats correct
27/12/23, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Blessmore, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 71 877 0996: It seems good to me so I guess we can start
27/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now Blessmore, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
27/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Is it supposed to be an essay or in point form
27/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Please, can be both.

28/12/23, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/12/23, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*
28/12/23, 12:00 pm - +249 96 758 6108: Can it help my son to attain his goal of becoming a chartered accountant
28/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
28/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
28/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
28/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok I understand
28/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 877 0996: But how can this course help me on my journey to my career
28/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.
28/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.
28/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.

28/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok I get it
28/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 877 0996: After I am done with the B.com can I continue to pursue ACCA at your institution
28/12/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Blessmore, unfortunately ACCA course is not available with us, but after you do B.com, you can be an accountant and prepare for ACCA simultaneously.
28/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok that works for me
28/12/23, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
28/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Yes I researched about it a bit after you told me about it
28/12/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
28/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Ok
28/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: Please, do.
28/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 877 0996: The career opportunities for a graduate with a Bachelor of Commerce degree are numerous, and I would love to share my thoughts on how this degree could shape my future. In five years, I see myself working as a chartered accountant at a prestigious firm like Old Mutual. That is after I have finished the ACCA programme elsewhere. Edoofa's program will provide me with the technical skills and knowledge I need to pass the exams required to become a chartered accountant, and the university's reputation will give me a strong competitive edge in the job market. I believe that the degree will also give me the business and leadership skills I need to succeed in my career.
I eagerly anticipate the journey ahead and am confident that my future holds great promise. With a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Edoofa, I am well-prepared to meet the challenges of a career in chartered accounting and will be ready to embrace the opportunities that come my way.
In summary, I am grateful for the educational opportunities that have been made available to me, and I look forward to using these opportunities to reach my full potential.
28/12/23, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Blessmore, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
28/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Yes I am willing and ready to do my best
28/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 877 0996: I'm looking for a scholarship which may reduce the b
Load  on my parents , in addition most of the universities in Zimbabwe do not offer ACCA
28/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Atleast at your institution I would be able to take it half way towards that goal
28/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 877 0996: I would try to give others the same opportunity given that I have the resources to cater for them
28/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Blessmore, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
28/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 877 0996: That's correct
28/12/23, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 877 0996: Just a little bit curious now that you brought it up
28/12/23, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
28/12/23, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*
