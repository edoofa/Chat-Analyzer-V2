27/12/23, 8:18 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Chelsey, Mr and Mrs Chirimuta!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
27/12/23, 8:24 am - +263 78 897 8845: I am now online
27/12/23, 9:13 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Chelsey,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
27/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 897 8845: Okay Mr Gurvinder
27/12/23, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Chelsey, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Derylin, is that correct?
27/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 897 8845: Yes it's correct
27/12/23, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Derylin, also do tell me whether you learnt about Derylin’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
27/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 897 8845: I don't know much about it l only know that Edoofa is a scholarship program giving scholarship to study in India
27/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 897 8845: She also told me about her journey
27/12/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
27/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
27/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
27/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
27/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 897 8845: Noted
27/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Chelsey, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 897 8845: Noted
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Now Chelsey, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

27/12/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 897 8845: I send a message to someone looking for the school number
28/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 897 8845: Mbizi Mrs. MGHS Headmaster.vcf (file attached)

*“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
28/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 897 8845: Noted
28/12/23, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study - Business Administration
, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
28/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 78 897 8845: Through my research l found out that Business Administration is the most paying job in the commercial department .So as a commercial student having many dreams l would like to take my opportunity and study it
28/12/23, 11:41 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Chelsey, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
28/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 78 897 8845: Yes I am willing
28/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 897 8845: I believe that the education abroad is better than the one in Zimbabwe
28/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 897 8845: If it's possible l will go to a teacher's college and teach my fellow citizens about the degree
28/12/23, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Chelsey, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
28/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 897 8845: I agree
28/12/23, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 897 8845: I didn't know
28/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
28/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*
