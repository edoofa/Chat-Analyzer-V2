*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
26/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 310 3998: Good morning

26/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 310 3998: Most appreciated
26/12/23, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, but first Mazvita, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Abdul, is that correct?

26/12/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Thank you sir
God Bless You Too
27/12/23, 8:28 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
27/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 310 3998: Morning everyone
27/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
27/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
27/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
27/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
27/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
27/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 310 3998: Yesss
27/12/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mazvita, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
27/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 310 3998: Yes i can meet these metrics
27/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 310 3998: Dad👑❤️.vcf (file attached)
27/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 310 3998: Please add my father’s number

27/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 310 3998: Okay thank you <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder added +263 71 878 9938
27/12/23, 8:06 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology*
28/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 310 3998: What type of jobs can one do with sociology since I’m not familiar with it?
Though I’m willing to take up the course
28/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society. Sociology is a branch of study which investigates multiple aspects of society and social behavior which helps them to do social work. A Bachelor's degree in Sociology teaches the fundamental concepts related to the structure of society, organization of society, and how humans interact within these constructs. The basic subject matter of Sociology concerns itself with topics related to family structure, global warfare, religious cults, social class, race, and gender, etc.
28/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: *Course Outline*

This program provides you with an understanding of core traditions and contemporary developments in sociological thinking and research. The theories and methods we explore enable us to examine the character and workings of the social institutions that govern people’s lives and encourage us to critically question the social values we live by. This program provides you with an understanding of core traditions and contemporary developments in sociological thinking and research.

28/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: *Career Opportunities*

This degree course enables the students to go for various Sociology related jobs such as in industry, commerce, the NHS, education authorities, further and higher education, and charitable, counseling, and voluntary organizations.
One can go for higher degree programs in respective subjects for further research work in Sociology.

Opportunities also exist for sociology graduates in the civil service and graduate management training schemes. Sociology graduates work with a varied and diverse client group during the course of their career.
28/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts in Sociology* includes a number of compulsory subjects. Along with that, the students will also have to choose from a number of elective subjects. The elective subjects may differ from college to college.
28/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 310 3998: It’s quite a rich course and I’ll be interested to take up the course in consultation with my parents.
28/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
28/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
28/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Yes indeed 
I’ll aim for higher maximum points
28/12/23, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
28/12/23, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
28/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Yes i did
28/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
28/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 310 3998: In 5 years time after the completion of the course I see myself as a graduate who had gained valuable experience and knowledge through internship and other opportunities.I intend to achieve a degree in Human Resources.I see myself as an individual who is willing to adapt to the company’s needs by reaching out to the people’s needs.Edoofa provides a platform for me to be able to learn by lessening my financial difficulties and providing some career opportunities for me.
28/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Mazvita I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
28/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Yes i am willing to put all of my effort
28/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 310 3998: If you could also guide me besides Human Resources what else can I do
28/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Though I am willing to do Human Resources
28/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Studying abroad provides me a unique opportunity to see more of the world than being confined in my country.Also Zimbabwe has limited access to educational equipments as compared to other countries.
28/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Studying abroad also helps me to appreciate different cultures and overcome bigger challenges
28/12/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
28/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 310 3998: This will help as I may gain knowledge that may bring valuable expertise to my country as i would have connected with different organizations within the developed countries.
28/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Mazvita, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
28/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Yes I agree
28/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 310 3998: Yes
28/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 310 3998: And I believe that Indians are considered one of the most intelligent people
28/12/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
28/12/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*
