According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

27/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 445 2768: Noted
27/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 445 2768: I hope it will work out
27/12/23, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
27/12/23, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
27/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 445 2768: 100% confident

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
28/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 445 2768: Yes I’m willing
28/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 445 2768: I will manage
28/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 445 2768: The main reason why I want to study abroad is I want good educational facilities which are not there in my country and some of the courses offered in local universities are not recognized internationally.
28/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 445 2768: I will try by all means to educate the young ones that education is the key and  after that I will advice the facilitators about the different types of education systems abroad.

Don’t you agree?
28/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 445 2768: Yes I do agree.
28/12/23, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

28/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: So now Anotida, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
28/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 445 2768: For the meantime I don’t have any questions I will ask if I have any questions
28/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
28/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 445 2768: No
28/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
28/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 445 2768: Interesting
28/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
28/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 445 2768: Yes you can
28/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: Anotida, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 445 2768: Thank you sir
28/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 445 2768: A very good program
28/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

28/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
28/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

28/12/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
28/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 445 2768: So you’re given the EWYL every month until you finish
28/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 445 2768: You earn it every month or
28/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Please, the EWYL program starts as soon as you are enrolled in the Edoofa program, and goes on till end of your education journey.
28/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
28/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 445 2768: The EWYL will benefit me
28/12/23, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Anotida, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 445 2768: So EWYL is a good program
28/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 445 2768: So it goes directly to my tuition
28/12/23, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
28/12/23, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/12/23, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

28/12/23, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
28/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 445 2768: I didn’t understand your question sir
28/12/23, 4:24 pm - Gurvinder: Have you had detailed talks about studying abroad with them?
28/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 445 2768: Yes I talked to them
