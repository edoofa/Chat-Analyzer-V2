We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

28/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Susan, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Kailler, is that correct?
28/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 022 1246: Yes
28/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Susan, also do tell me whether you learnt about Susan’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
28/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 022 1246: ok so from what I heard from my friend Edoofa is a program or an institute that helps students to meet or fulfill their dreams and this is so because they offer them help financially and from this I also so myself being one of the students who will get the chance to fulfill my dreams that is if am found worth to be helped by Edoofa and I will have a brighter future
28/12/23, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
28/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
28/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
28/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 022 1246: Indeed that's exactly what am looking for
28/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 022 1246: Ok thank you
28/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 022 1246: Well understood and indeed that's wonderful Edoofa is really  of great importance to the nations improving the quality of education and ensuring that students meet their dreams
28/12/23, 8:45 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
