*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
28/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Good day sir
28/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes it's the right person
28/12/23, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Sharmaine,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
28/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Thank you very much sir

My mother is at work now so he won't be able to respond at the moment
28/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Sharmaine, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Munyaradzi, is that correct?
28/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes thats correct
28/12/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Munyaradzi, also do tell me whether you learnt about Munyaradzi’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
28/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 355 5813: I learnt that The Edoofa Scholarship Program can help make that dream a reality. That it's a program is designed to support young people from all backgrounds in accessing quality education, and it can open up a world of opportunities for you.
With this scholarship, you can access some of the best universities in India, gain new skills and knowledge, and build a bright future for yourself.
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
28/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes that is so Mr Gurvinder
28/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Sharmaine, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
28/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 355 5813: Yes l believe so
28/12/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Now Sharmaine, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

So l really want to learn to assist in the development of the employees and play part in influencing strategic business decisions.....Business Studies was my favorite subject at school and l learnt a lot about business which triggered me to do HUman Resource
28/12/23, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, and @263788682033 you?
28/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 868 2033: I loved electrical engineering because electrical engineers work in high-stake environments, they may face intense job pressure. They may also spend more hours at work meeting deadlines and completing their projects. Although electrical engineers may have excellent salary prospects, they often receive limited job growth. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 868 2033: In accounting, helping people solve their problems and achieve their business goals is a pretty rewarding way to spend my time.

Personal development and aspiration, intellectual growth and personal interest in accounting 
I also enjoy working with financial reports in my daily work and the constant learning aspect that comes with working in accounting for example enjoying using mathematics and the skills that come along with a math-focused career. 
Accountants make up the backbone of every business and make a great career choice in terms of security and pay.
28/12/23, 8:44 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
28/12/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 868 2033: Thank you very much
Have a good day too
