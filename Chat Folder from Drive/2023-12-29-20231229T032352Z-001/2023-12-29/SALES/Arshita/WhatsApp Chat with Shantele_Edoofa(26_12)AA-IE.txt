What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
I learnt that with Edoofa, your education is taken care of in India. It offers scholarships to India only but you choose the college you want after getting accepted. Upon arrival at respective schools, Edoofa will assist all the way through your admission processing until you start your classes. They are always there for you to check up with your progress. 

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?

I believe i should be accepted because of the dedication i have toward my school work. The zeal to want to achieve my goals and meet deadlines of assignments makes me eligible for Edoofa.
