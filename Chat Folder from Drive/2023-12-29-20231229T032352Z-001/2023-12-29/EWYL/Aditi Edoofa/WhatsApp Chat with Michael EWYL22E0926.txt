28/12/23, 1:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/12/23, 1:07 PM - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs.

28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: The Child of the *DEO, Manicaland* Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
_*United College of Education*_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 


Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, _*Headmaster of Chibuwe High*_, the son of Ms. Christina Rockson, _The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School_, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, _DEO at Masvingo province_ are Edoofians and they have many more success stories from _St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High_, etc
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
28/12/23, 1:11 PM - +263 78 015 2306: Will do much appreciated
28/12/23, 2:15 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
