Considering your hectic schedule, I've made some adjustments to our timetable.

*From now onwards, our sessions will take place from Monday to Friday, spanning from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*. Yes, we've extended the session to 2 hours for a more productive interaction. 

So are you excited about the session? <This message was edited>

*Now we will meet tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*
I want you to inculcate the habit of joining the session on your own and just give a quick "I'm here" when you're online at 1:30 pm. 
Can I expect this from you?

There is one thing that I wanted to share with you. Edoofa is organizing a fully sponsered industrial visit *for our students here in India*
Today I am a little occupied with the planning for the event so I would like to reschedule the session to tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm.

Kindly excuse me for the inconveniences caused but don't worry we will definitely make up for it tomorrow.
Have a nice day ahead.
27/12/23, 2:47 PM - +263 78 046 5800: You too ma'am
