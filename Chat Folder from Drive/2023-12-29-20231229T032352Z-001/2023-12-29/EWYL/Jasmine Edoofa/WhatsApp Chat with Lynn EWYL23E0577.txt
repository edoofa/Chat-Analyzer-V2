*Keeping your routine in mind, I've shifted our session timings for a more productive engagement.* I've noticed that you were going through several challenges leading to your absence from recent sessions, and I want you to know that I understand. That's why I've adjusted the session timings. Now before our next session, I'd appreciate it if you could answer the following:

▪️Could you share the reasons behind your recent session absences?
▪️Are you confident in your understanding of all the EWYL projects? If so, which one is your favorite project?
▪️Can you promise 🤞🏼 to attend every session moving forward?
I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this message and confirmation of your understanding of the *new session timings.* <This message was edited>
