Before delving into your Christmas celebrations, I'd like to bring your attention to the session timings. 
Considering your hectic schedule, I've made some adjustments to our timetable.

*From now onwards, our sessions will take place from Monday to Friday, spanning from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*. Yes, we've extended the session to 2 hours for a more productive interaction. 

So are you excited about the session?

Hope you're ready for today's session.

*Have you heard about New Year's resolutions?* It's when people make a promise for the new year. 
You know, my resolution is to make sure that each of my students earns scholarship credits and excels in the EWYL Program.
