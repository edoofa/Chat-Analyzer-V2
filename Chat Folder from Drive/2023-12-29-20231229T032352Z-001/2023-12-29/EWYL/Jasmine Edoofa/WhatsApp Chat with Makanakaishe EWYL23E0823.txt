23/12/23, 1:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that now we will be meeting on *Thursday i.e. 28-Dec-2023 for your session from 7:00 pm - 9:00 pm* (African Time)

*Keeping your routine in mind, I've shifted our session timings for a more productive engagement.* 
Since we will meet after a few couple of days so I want you to make the most of your time post-celebrations. *To track your progress, I'm setting a goal for you: submit five applications (Community Building/School Reform Project) by Thursday*

I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this message and confirmation of your understanding of the *new session timings.*
