28/12/23, 3:19 PM - +263 77 956 9902: Tne best way to execute Project 2 is to create a WhatsApp group consisting of students who are either in form 6 or have executed their form 6 already and to reach out in numbers you add a lot of your schoolmates in the form six or who have finished. Once they have joined the group i then select suitable students and in the group i send information about edoofa persuading them on why the program is most profitable to them and can help them gain international education
