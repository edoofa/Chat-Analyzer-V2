There is one thing that I wanted to share with you. Edoofa is organizing a fully sponsered industrial visit *for our students here in India*
Today I am a little occupied with the planning for the event so I would like to reschedule the session to tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm.

Kindly excuse me for the inconveniences caused but don't worry we will definitely make up for it tomorrow.
Have a nice day ahead.

We have seen that it seems like he is experiencing network challenges. Hopefully he will pick up everything. But once we gain communication link with him, we will alert him.
28/12/23, 1:28 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
Thank you for letting me know. 
May I know were you able to get in touch with Promise?
