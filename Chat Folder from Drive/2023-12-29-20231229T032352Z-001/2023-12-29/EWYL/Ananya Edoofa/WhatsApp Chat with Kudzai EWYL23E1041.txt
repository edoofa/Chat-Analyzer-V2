26/12/23, 8:56 AM - +27 73 055 2749: The Mayor of casterbridge by Thomas Hardy
26/12/23, 8:56 AM - Ananya Edoofa: That's incredible! Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
26/12/23, 8:58 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky there is mom buh she went to Zimbabwe and there is poor network there
26/12/23, 9:01 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, ow that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/12/23, 9:04 AM - +27 73 055 2749: No I don't
26/12/23, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/12/23, 9:05 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/12/23, 9:09 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky understood
26/12/23, 9:14 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/12/23, 9:26 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky thank you for making me to meet wit her
26/12/23, 9:28 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, it's really nice to meet my new student today! I wish we could have connected for a longer time. However, let us conclude our session for today, and let us connect tomorrow at the same time. See you!🎄
26/12/23, 9:29 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky thank you see u tomorrow
27/12/23, 8:30 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Kudzai! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄
27/12/23, 9:06 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky morng sorry for being late
27/12/23, 9:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Why are you late, Kudzai?
27/12/23, 9:08 AM - +27 73 055 2749: The electricity was gone and the network was poor
27/12/23, 9:09 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
27/12/23, 9:12 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Yes
27/12/23, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
27/12/23, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 9:17 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky

27/12/23, 9:29 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Yes
27/12/23, 9:35 AM - +27 73 055 2749: I'm done
27/12/23, 4:59 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session earlier. However, since our session time is over, we shall connect tomorrow at the same time.
27/12/23, 5:20 PM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky thank you a lot
28/12/23, 8:33 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Kudzai!

As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that count." - Winston Churchill

Let's approach our work today with determination and a mindset geared towards progress. Together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to a productive and inspiring session!🚀
28/12/23, 8:34 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Morng
28/12/23, 8:35 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Oky thank u for the motivation
28/12/23, 8:37 AM - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
28/12/23, 8:41 AM - +27 73 055 2749: EDOOFA HALL OF INSPIRATION
28/12/23, 8:42 AM - +27 73 055 2749: That was the section I liked most
28/12/23, 8:42 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
28/12/23, 8:49 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Yes definitely yes
28/12/23, 8:50 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Now, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
28/12/23, 8:53 AM - +27 73 055 2749: Great
28/12/23, 8:56 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of.

28/12/23, 9:14 AM - +27 73 055 2749: I'm still reading
28/12/23, 9:17 AM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude our session today, reflect on the progress you've made and the insights gained. If there's anything specific you'd like to focus on in our future sessions, feel free to share. Wishing you continued success and looking forward to our next session! 🌟
