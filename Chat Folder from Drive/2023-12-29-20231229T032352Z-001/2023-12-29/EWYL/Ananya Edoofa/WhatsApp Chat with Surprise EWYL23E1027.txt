23/12/23, 1:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 1:53 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Thank you
26/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Suprise!

I really hope that your Christmas went well. Let's discuss how we celebrated our Christmas this year in our session! Come on, join your EWYL Line, and let's talk about our celebration!
26/12/23, 1:34 PM - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
26/12/23, 1:43 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes Ms Ananya I really enjoyed, I hope you did too
26/12/23, 1:46 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:48 PM - +263 71 380 4934: That's a beautiful Xmas tree, I can see you had a blast
26/12/23, 1:50 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Amazing, I'm sure we will achieve those goals
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
26/12/23, 1:52 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 1:53 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes
26/12/23, 1:55 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
26/12/23, 2:32 PM - Ananya Edoofa: For today, we need to wrap up our session, and we'll continue this discussion in our next session, which is tomorrow at 1:30 p.m!
26/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes Ma'am
26/12/23, 3:06 PM - +263 71 380 4934: I have understood that the projects in the EWYL program are mainly centered on advertising the Edoofa program in my community so that a lot of ambitious individuals who are hungry for success can get the opportunity to make their dreams a reality. On the other hand  this will help me to be socially connected and to be social media literate. Some projects will even take me as far as having to connect with huge companies in my country helping me to know more about how business formalities are handled. I will have to arrange for video calls and facilitating the signing of contracts. In this I will learn how to deal with rejections, failures and help me develop endurance and also the "try, try again, never give up" attitude. The projects will be split into small activities and I will be helped in carrying out these projects. Apart  from all these skills I will also be awarded scholarship credits upon completion of these activities.
27/12/23, 1:28 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Suprise! What did one wall say to the other wall?

I'll meet you at the corner!' Now that we've built a little humor, let's construct some great ideas in today's session.😄
27/12/23, 1:29 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes ma'am 😅
Afternoon
27/12/23, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
27/12/23, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 1:42 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes ma'am, I'm done
27/12/23, 2:03 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
27/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 71 380 4934: I have learnt that the best way to do the first project is to connect with my relatives, neighbors and friend's parents who work in the companies of interest and talk to them about edoofa and my project. I would also have to create a LinkedIn account so I have to download the LinkedIn app on play store to research on such companies and talk to the mangers. I will be helped in doing this.
27/12/23, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Suprise. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
27/12/23, 2:08 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:10 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Ok
27/12/23, 2:12 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
27/12/23, 2:57 PM - +263 71 380 4934: The document was teaching me on how to start the project and help me have an idea of the type of companies that would be the best targets. I have to research on the backgrounds of the founders of the company, their experiences and everything there is to know about them. I got examples of links that would lead me to the backgrounds of certain founders. I also learnt about the platforms that  from which I can get the information that I need on the company of interest. I can also visit their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages and see recent posts. But the best way is to connect with heads of different departments in the companies before reaching out to the founders.
27/12/23, 2:58 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Is there a way to know if the company is already in touch with Edoofa before proceeding with the research
27/12/23, 4:58 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to proceed with our session earlier. However, since our session time is over, we shall connect tomorrow at the same time.
27/12/23, 5:45 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Yes ma'am
28/12/23, 1:33 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Suprise!

As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that count." - Winston Churchill

Let's approach our work today with determination and a mindset geared towards progress. Together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to a productive and inspiring session!🚀
28/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Afternoon ma'am
I already know that quote from one of the documents you sent😅
28/12/23, 1:38 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, great!

28/12/23, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *Suprise, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
28/12/23, 1:45 PM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
28/12/23, 2:01 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Community building
In this project I have to talk to my friends, relatives or schoolmates about edoofa and if they are interested they would have to talk to their parents. If their parents give a go ahead and Once I see that they are actually serious with the program, then I will have to share with them my knowledge and experience with Edoofa. I would also be given an offline form that I will give them to fill. Once it is filled, I will have to send it to this group. I'm allowed to send only 10 forms per week.
28/12/23, 2:14 PM - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

28/12/23, 2:15 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Understood
28/12/23, 2:17 PM - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
28/12/23, 2:20 PM - +263 71 380 4934: Okay ma'am
28/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/12/23, 2:23 PM - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
