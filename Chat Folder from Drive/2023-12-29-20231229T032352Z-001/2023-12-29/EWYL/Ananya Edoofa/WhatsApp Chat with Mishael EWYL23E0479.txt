Facing challenges and doing many things at once is like a magic trick for success. Trying new things is where the fun happens, and doing a few things together is how you go higher. You know, like when people work a bit to pay for school? It's a bit like that. If you want good things to happen, just start with a little effort. Believe me, it's a cool way to get big things coming your way!
