I hope this message finds you well amidst your ongoing exams. I couldn't help but notice that I haven't received a Christmas greeting from you. I understand that exam preparations are consuming much of your time and energy, but it's disheartening to see that you couldn't spare a couple of minutes to extend your wishes.

As your mentor, I've been supportive and have even provided you with holidays to dedicate to your exam preparations. However, it's disconcerting to witness a lack of acknowledgment or a brief moment taken to convey your holiday wishes.

Is there something on your mind, or is there a reason for this silence?
27/12/23, 3:52 PM - +91 95015 56890: pardon me ma’am, I sincerely apologize for not being able to return your message in time. Thank you for wishing me a merry festive season, I really appreciated the message. Christmas was nice on our end and I too trust you have been in good and healthy spirits over the last couple of days.😊

As Arthur's parents, we wish to thank you a million times for the unwavering mentoring support you have been providing to our son since day 1. You have been consistent, patient and professional through & through. As his parents, we rest assured that Arthur is taken very good care of. Maintain the tempo & keep the momentum ma'am Ana. 
Now I am failing to understand how & why Arthur could fail to spare you a thought by dropping you a Christmas greeting - at least! I doubt if that noble gesture would have cost Arthur even a half rupee.

Anyways, as Arthur's parents, we wish you ma'am Ana and the rest of EDOOFA team a prosperous NEW YEAR. Continue being good & supportive to son Arthur.
Be blessed abundantly!

Our kindest of regards,

Arthur's mom & dad

Thank you so much for your kind gesture and sweet words. I am truly happy and grateful to have your support. Regarding Arthur, he is a very sweet boy, and I believe he must be occupied; hence, he couldn't respond. Otherwise, he never misses a chance to make me proud.
