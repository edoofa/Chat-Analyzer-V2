27/12/23, 3:57 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Makanaka,

I hope this message finds you well amidst your ongoing exams. I couldn't help but notice that I haven't received a Christmas greeting from you. I understand that exam preparations are consuming much of your time and energy, but it's disheartening to see that you couldn't spare a couple of minutes to extend your wishes.

As your mentor, I've been supportive and have even provided you with holidays to dedicate to your exam preparations. However, it's disconcerting to witness a lack of acknowledgment or a brief moment taken to convey your holiday wishes.

Is there something on your mind, or is there a reason for this silence?

I trust this message finds you well. I appreciate your hard work, and it's evident that you are one of the diligent students. My only concern is that I haven't received a response to my previous question. Nothing else.
