As we embark on today's session, I'd like to set a positive tone with a motivating quote:

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that count." - Winston Churchill

28/12/23, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, That's awesome! Reading is such a great way to unwind. What kind of books do you usually go for? And aiming to be one of the best software engineers? That's some serious ambition!
28/12/23, 8:39 AM - +263 71 968 8377: I am looking forward to a victorious day
28/12/23, 8:39 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/12/23, 8:41 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Every morning before my day begins l read inspirational life-changing books such as Atomic Habits, Can't hurt me.
28/12/23, 8:41 AM - +263 71 968 8377: It truly is.
28/12/23, 8:42 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Then throughout the day l enjoy some fantasy, romance, or thriller books
28/12/23, 8:42 AM - +263 71 968 8377: No, I do not please enlighten me.
28/12/23, 8:44 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Well, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/12/23, 8:45 AM - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/12/23, 8:47 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Thank you, l am now fully aware of the objectives and am thrilled by them.
28/12/23, 8:49 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/12/23, 8:51 AM - +263 71 968 8377: It is such a pleasure to be acquainted by them too. Nice to meet you all. <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 8:52 AM - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/12/23, 8:53 AM - +263 71 968 8377: It really does.
28/12/23, 8:56 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

28/12/23, 9:05 AM - +263 71 968 8377: This is very eye-opening and l am truly inspired by Nyasha's story.
28/12/23, 9:06 AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
28/12/23, 9:08 AM - +263 71 968 8377: It is so comforting and l am excited to embark on this.
28/12/23, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
28/12/23, 9:13 AM - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:18 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Yes, let me go through it
28/12/23, 9:18 AM - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
28/12/23, 9:26 AM - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude our session today, reflect on the progress you've made and the insights gained. If there's anything specific you'd like to focus on in our future sessions, feel free to share. Wishing you continued success and looking forward to our next session! 🌟
28/12/23, 9:27 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Thank you l certainly will do so. I am looking forward to it too.
28/12/23, 10:14 AM - +263 71 968 8377: Should l start with the Corporate Alliances Project?
