26/12/23, 10:41 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
26/12/23, 10:41 AM - Saloni Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
26/12/23, 10:41 AM - Saloni Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

27/12/23, 10:37 AM - Saloni Edoofa: I'd like to share the success story of our star performer from last week, Loice. She successfully identified and reached out to three potential schools to meet her targets. Interestingly, she utilized Google for her research. Loice performed searches like 'School nearby,' 'School in Harare,' and 'School in Manicaland,' generating valuable results. Remarkably, she achieved this without physically visiting the schools. Using Google, she gathered essential information, including contact details, and then initiated communication with them via WhatsApp.

27/12/23, 10:45 AM - +263 78 719 3568: Alright maam l would like to ask a question can someone who did their O level studies  only attain a degree after  getting a diploma

27/12/23, 10:50 AM - +263 78 719 3568: Alright
