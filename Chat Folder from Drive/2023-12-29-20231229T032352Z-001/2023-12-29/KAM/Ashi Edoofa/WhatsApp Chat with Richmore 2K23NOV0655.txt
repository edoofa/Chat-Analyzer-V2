In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
27/12/23, 5:08 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Afternoon how are you mam

Yes I'm ready for it
27/12/23, 5:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine dear, thank you. I am glad to know that you are ready for today's session, May I know if you have gone through the videos shared by Mr. Shivjeet?
27/12/23, 5:10 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes, I went through all of them
27/12/23, 5:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
27/12/23, 5:16 PM - +263 77 198 7801: For a student to have high scholarship credits and maximum scholarship, he should be teachable and open minded i.e he should be intelligent and creative. Also he should follow intrusctions accordingly.

 The vision of tge founders of Edoofa is that quality education but accessible and that students must job ready after course completion. So they invested a lot of time to seacrh for universities in which Edoofians should go and student must be able convince the university admission team the same he or she convinced the Admission Board of Edoofa. This is done by filling the SOP form
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263771987801 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 5:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 5:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/12/23, 5:18 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Ok I forgot to introduce my self pardon me for that

Am Rhodyn Richmore Makaza
27/12/23, 5:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear,
27/12/23, 5:23 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes I do agree with all of the info
27/12/23, 5:23 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Thanks
27/12/23, 5:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
27/12/23, 5:29 PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes we are together

Let's move on mam. It's very vivid and understandable
27/12/23, 5:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:00 PM.
27/12/23, 5:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.
