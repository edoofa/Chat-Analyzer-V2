27/12/23, 10:16 AM - +260 97 8532307: According the my research, a cardiovascular technologist deals more this computers, assess what the problem is and assist the cardiovascular specialist whom actually carries out the operations.
And for one to be a cardiovascular specialist they are to become a medical doctor first

28/12/23, 7:04 PM - +260 97 8532307: What does it take to do a BSc in Medicine as opposed to the cardiovascular Technology?
28/12/23, 7:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @260978532307, According to the subject combination you have, we came to notice that in the medical field the required topics taught to you are not sufficient enough to cope with the minimum requirements for pursuing Medicine in India. 

At the same time even after meeting the subject requirements, in order to study Medicine in India, a student will have to clear the NEET entrance exam which is one of the toughest exams Globally with just 5000 students qualifying from a Million
28/12/23, 7:39 PM - +260 97 8532307: So when do I seat for the exams?
28/12/23, 7:39 PM - +260 97 8532307: And what subjects are required?
28/12/23, 7:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @260978532307, In order to study the medical science, the student should have 3 Mandatory subjects in Grade 12 which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
28/12/23, 7:48 PM - +260 97 8532307: Understood, I used to take the following subjects
28/12/23, 7:48 PM - +260 97 8532307: For the fact that I took the following subjects do I still have to seat the exams
28/12/23, 7:49 PM - +260 97 8532307: And If I have, when do I seat for them
28/12/23, 7:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, According to your results, you don't have these subject in your 12th grade right?
28/12/23, 7:53 PM - +260 97 8532307: The grade 12 results have not being announced yet but I took pure biology, pure physics, pure chemistry and other subjects because I was in a pure class
28/12/23, 7:55 PM - +260 97 8532307: The results will be announced next month in January
28/12/23, 7:59 PM - +260 97 8532307: And I am optimistic I will obtain distinctions in all 3. And if that turns out to be the case what is the guidance?
28/12/23, 8:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @260978532307, I am sure you will get a good result. However, In order to pursue Medicine in India, a student will have to seat for the NEET entrance exam which is one of the toughest exam. In order to sit for the exam, you have to come to India to pursue your Bachelors and then once you are in India you can write NEET exam and if you qualify it then you can start your MBBS and if you fail to  qualify then you can continue with the Bachelors course.
