27/12/23, 4:48 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Let's begin

27/12/23, 5:05 PM - +263 71 582 8724: For the confirmation letter the school authorities are not at the station they are  closed up until 5 January
27/12/23, 5:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, you can share the letter of recommendation after 5th of January and share the remaining academic documents for now.
27/12/23, 5:26 PM - +263 71 582 8724: Fine she is doing
27/12/23, 5:29 PM - +263 71 582 8724: There is this 500-1000 deposit which you say will be paid some weeks after receiving offer letter ,  are we the one who are going to pay
27/12/23, 5:42 PM - +263 71 947 4887: I am facing some difficulties to fill the forms left so which one is the appropriate application to use for filling the fos
27/12/23, 5:42 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Forms
27/12/23, 6:23 PM - +263 71 947 4887: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 6:23 PM - +263 71 947 4887: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 6:23 PM - +263 71 947 4887: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 6:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please you are correct. This $500 to $1000 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
27/12/23, 6:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents, I shall wait for your response to the forms.
27/12/23, 6:52 PM - +263 71 582 8724: The period you want this money is too short for us i earn 125us per month
27/12/23, 6:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand however, please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?

27/12/23, 8:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263719474887 surely it will be the next day which is 3rd January.

28/12/23, 6:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 6:55 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Done
28/12/23, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 6:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 7:13 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Clear
28/12/23, 7:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 7:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 7:37 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Yes I am following
28/12/23, 7:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/12/23, 7:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/12/23, 7:51 PM - +263 71 947 4887: Clear
28/12/23, 7:52 PM - +263 71 947 4887: So is there any amount needed to be payed after paying the registration fee
