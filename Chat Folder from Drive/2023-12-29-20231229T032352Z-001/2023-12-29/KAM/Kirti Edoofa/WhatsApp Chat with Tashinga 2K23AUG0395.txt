28/12/23, 6:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Parents and Tashinga.

I hope you are doing well. I just received an update from the accounts team. Regarding the order, you must be aware that there is a monthly account transaction limit for Mama Money. I just checked with the accounts team and they mentioned that the Mama Money's Limit for this month has been reached due to a higher number of students joining the program from South Africa. <This message was edited>

- Beneficiary Name: Avreen Singh
- Bank Name: ICICI Bank
- Savings Account Number: 055201503452
- IFSC Code: ICIC0000552
