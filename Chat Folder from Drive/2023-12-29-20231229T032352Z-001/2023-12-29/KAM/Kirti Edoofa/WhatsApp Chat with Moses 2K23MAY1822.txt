I trust you're all in good health. I wanted to reach out today, as the second deadline is drawing near. Hence I wanted to check on your preparations for this and to inquire about your plans, especially considering the upcoming festival season. Could you please let me know which date you have in mind to make the payment for the second deadline?

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $337 for your university registration fee is due before January 1, 2024. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations as you did not respond to our message shared earlier.

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $337 by now?

I hope you're doing well. I've been awaiting a response from you but haven't received an update yet. I wanted to reach out again to check on the status of the payment, as your deadline is near and you shared that you will be making the deposit today. It's important for us to provide an update to the university officials accordingly.

Could you please let me know if you were able to complete the payment today? Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements? <This message was edited>
