I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that. However, as we are currently in the holiday season, there's a possibility that you might encounter unforeseen challenges at the bank. 

To be on the side of caution, we advise making the payment a day in advance. This precaution ensures you have a backup day, minimizing the risk of losing out on the entire opportunity. I trust you have taken note of our recommendation?

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for the last part of your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
