I'll also discuss your daily availability for future sessions. Count on me to guide you through the initial steps and address any queries you may have.

Simultaneously, I am providing you with two essential forms which are to be filled out during our session on December 28th. To stay proactive, please print these forms in advance and have them ready for the session. I will guide you on filling them out during our discussion.

Starting from our sessions on the 28th, we aim to complete your initial admission formalities and provide guidance on the steps needed before January 3rd. Timely completion of these steps is vital for your EWYL Program commencement on January 5th. Failure to do so may result in a delay in your journey. Please understand the importance of printing out the forms in advance and ensure you do so.
