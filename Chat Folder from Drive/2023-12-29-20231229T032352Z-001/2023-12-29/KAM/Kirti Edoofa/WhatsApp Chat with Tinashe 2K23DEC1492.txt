I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/12/23, 4:33 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
27/12/23, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:40 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Done
27/12/23, 4:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 4:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/12/23, 4:42 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
27/12/23, 4:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 4:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
27/12/23, 5:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 5:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/12/23, 5:29 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes it’s clear
27/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
27/12/23, 6:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes please
27/12/23, 6:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

27/12/23, 6:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

28/12/23, 2:24 PM - +263 71 418 5330: The statement of purpose helps me to get the best scholarship credits and Edoofa has links with the top universities of India because of the 15+years of experience and resources which they have catered for edoofians to have great learning experience . Most institutions were driven by people who were trying to make money rather than pursuing Good education therefore Edoofa has dug deep and looked into visionaries and spent quality time researching for vision Aries who have invested 20+ years of resources into quality education in their institutions and thus Edoofa has seats in this institutions for international students who have scholarship so that they can get quality education. Quality of teaching staff , infrastructure ,opportunities accommodation, are checkpoints tht Edoofa has when selecting a University for students . Edoofa has developed an environment where culture and friendship roll together despite cultural differences. Edoofa’s purpose is not only to get you admitted to a school but the entire vision comes from the fact that they  have spent over 15 years working in the higher education domain working with colleges and Universities so that they can provide quality education and produce employable graduates.
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
28/12/23, 2:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

28/12/23, 5:50 PM - +263 71 418 5330: 2. Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference in Human Rights and Civil rights.

Rights are defined as claims of an individual that are essential for the development of his or her own self and that are recognized by society or the State these include the right to life, the right to a fair trial, freedom from torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the rights to health, education and an adequate standard of living.whilst a duty is something that someone is expected or required to do .Examples of duties  include obeying laws, paying taxes, defending the nation and serving on . Furthermore  human rights are the rights you have simply for being a human being which the right to a fair trial and presumption of innocence,freedom of thought, conscience and religion,freedom of opinion and expression,peaceful assembly,freedom of association,  participation in public affairsComparatively, civil rights are contextual meaning you are entitled to specific civil rights through being a citizen of a particular country, nation, or state. Civil rights are proclaimed by the government for the citizens of that country, while human rights are derived from natural law and are universally protected and applied.
28/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 71 418 5330: 3. What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney 


One of the critical distinguishing factors is that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt while the defense attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the client's innocence . The prosecutor must charge the accused with a specific crime or crimes, then present evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty .The prosecutor must also gather evidence to present in court, interview and prepare witnesses to testify in court, research all aspects of the case to prepare for cross-examination, and prepare opening and closing statements.The defense attorney must defend their client against criminal charges. The client is innocent until proven guilty.The attorney represents the client’s best interests at all stages of legal proceedings from arraignment to sentencing.The attorney helps the client to avoid incriminating himself and making sure the client’s constitutional rights are not violated.
28/12/23, 5:55 PM - +263 71 418 5330: 4.Which branch of law are you interested in pursuing, Civil , Corporate, Criminal and why ?


I want to study corporate law because it is an ideal career for my personal goals. I value financial stability and job security in my career,and corporate law provides these, as well as being a fascinating field that offers endless complex problems to solve and demands a wide variety of skills. I researched about corporate law during high school and I enjoyed the day-to-day work and the opportunity to collaborate, problem-solve and think critically about a variety of different matters.  Corporate law is an ideal lifelong career for me.Although sometimes the study of corporate law can be abstract in nature, the practice of corporate law offers a practical and hands-on career. With my legal knowledge I will be able to make a difference in businesses, and communities.

The ability to help others through the use of the  corporate law is not only highly rewarding but most importantly, serves a very needed purpose in the  business society.Corporate lawyers typically have an in-depth understanding of business practices, regulations and documents. In this profession, I might become an expert on topics like contracts, mergers and venture capital. I may also learn about business strategy by observing key decision-making
28/12/23, 5:59 PM - +263 71 418 5330: 5 .What skills do you have that will make you a successful lawyer , please elaborate with an example 

Corporate law is full different options, avenues and arguments for the same problem, and part of my job as a lawyer is choosing what would most benefit my client.Therefor my problem solving skills will help me to excel in my studies and become a great lawyer.Moreso written communication is another great skill which will highly help me in excelling in my studies because Being able to effectively get my ideas across in a variety of writing styles and registers is essential for success in the legal field. Drafting a contract is very different from writing a letter to a client therefore my skills in written communication will help me excel in my career.Verbal communication is key in the legal field and therefore my skills in verbal communication will help me excel since I have experience in public speaking and debate . Communicating my ideas to, as well as the various situations and environments I might find myself in, will alter the way I communicate. Communication is always supplemented with a goal, whether it is to simply get ng point across to my co-worker, or convince a jury. When it comes to law having a rock-solid grasp on spoken word is essential and it helps in winning a case and dominantly excelling .Also lm able to work under pressure As a lawyerI will be required to overcome obstacles and think on the spot on the daily. Thereforebeing high-functioning whilst under internal or external pressure is essential for my career. Whether I am working overnight to meet a deadline or talking to a difficult client working in a people-focused career will undoubtedly bring pressure along therefore my skill will help me overcome these obstacles and become a great lawyer. By applying ycommercial awarenessI will be able to stay abreast of changes in the legal sector and demonstrate to employers and clients that l have the necessary knowledge and law skills. This will help me stand out in the competitive job market and position myself for success in the legal profession.Detail

Attention to detail is an essential skill for any aspiring lawyer. In order to be successful in the field, you must be able to read and interpret complex legal documents, accurately recall facts and information, and spot inconsistencies between documents. Attention to detail is also  a skill which I  have which is important when it comes to researching and interpreting laws, as well as understanding case law and precedents.
This skill is particularly important when it comes to assessing documents and sources. An ability to spot key pieces of information is highly important,whether lm  looking for evidence to support my case or proofreading a contract where missing a detail could derail the whole task. Thus the above stated are skills which l have , thus they will help me to excel in my line of study
28/12/23, 6:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the academic interview questions it is duly noted with us. May I know by when will you be able to fill out the SOP form?
28/12/23, 7:37 PM - +263 71 418 5330: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
28/12/23, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
28/12/23, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BA LLB for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
28/12/23, 7:42 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 7:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
28/12/23, 7:46 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/12/23, 7:49 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/12/23, 7:59 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 8:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/12/23, 8:48 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/12/23, 8:50 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Yes
28/12/23, 8:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
28/12/23, 8:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/12/23, 9:07 PM - +263 71 418 5330: Okay noted
28/12/23, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
28/12/23, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
28/12/23, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
28/12/23, 9:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
