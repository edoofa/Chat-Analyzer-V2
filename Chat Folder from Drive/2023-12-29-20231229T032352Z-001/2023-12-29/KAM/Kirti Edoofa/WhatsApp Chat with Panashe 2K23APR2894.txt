I trust you're all in good health. I wanted to reach out today, as the second deadline is drawing near. Hence I wanted to check on your preparations for this and to inquire about your plans, especially considering the upcoming festival season. Could you please let me know which date you have in mind to make the payment for the second deadline?
26/12/23, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Panashe,

I trust this message finds you well and in high spirits. As I was organizing my day today, I took the opportunity to review your scholarship application file. I observed that the remaining amount of $425 for your university registration fee is due before January 1, 2024. Consequently, I wanted to reach out to inquire about your preparations as you mentioned earlier you will be able to update me next week. 

How is your preparation going forward? Have you been able to raise the outstanding amount of $425 by now? <This message was edited>
