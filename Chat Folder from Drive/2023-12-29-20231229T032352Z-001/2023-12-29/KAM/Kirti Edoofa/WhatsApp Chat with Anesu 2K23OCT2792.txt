26/12/23, 3:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. With regard to our previous conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

26/12/23, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.

27/12/23, 1:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear so far?
27/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Our network is down
27/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that network can be a challenge, however, we have not been able to have a smooth conversation for many days now, and it is impacting on Anesu's admission process if this time is a challenge for you may I know what time will be suitable for you to connect with us now?
27/12/23, 3:31 PM - +263 77 795 2977: As from 8 or 9am up to 1 pm it will be faster than now
27/12/23, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777952977 as you are aware our available hours are from 12:30 pm CAT to 08:30 pm CAT. So connecting with you at 08:00 am will not be possible for me.
27/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 77 795 2977: OK noted
27/12/23, 3:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/12/23, 4:39 PM - +263 77 795 2977: I'm available but Anesu is not around
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777952977 it is alright please, I am sure Anesu will be able to go through the conversation once available, in the meantime we can continue with our discussion.
27/12/23, 4:41 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Sure
27/12/23, 4:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
27/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes I have understand but clearly with our monthly salaries here paying a once off payment of 9000 USD is a big deal for me because that amount is double my salary but maybe I can manage instalments in 3 months of 300,300,300
27/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 77 795 2977: But however maybe I might have a salary increament in January next year I'm not sure
27/12/23, 5:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777952977 as we move ahead with our discussion your concern will be answered as well with additional benefits so please do not worry.
27/12/23, 5:51 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Noted thank you Kirti
27/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 77 795 2977: 👏👏👏
27/12/23, 5:53 PM - +263 77 795 2977: My network is slow your pardon Kirt
27/12/23, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that network can be a challenge. May I know if you are comfortable proceeding with the discussion now?
27/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes I am
27/12/23, 6:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/12/23, 6:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/12/23, 6:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/12/23, 6:19 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Noted
27/12/23, 6:21 PM - +263 77 795 2977: May i know  for convenience sake how much is the visa fee and flight fee so that I may prepare for it
27/12/23, 6:26 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Precisely thank you
27/12/23, 6:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you here. The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student and the visa fee is $83.
27/12/23, 6:30 PM - +263 77 795 2977: OK noted
27/12/23, 6:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/12/23, 6:31 PM - +263 77 795 2977: When are you expecting the students around August or when
27/12/23, 6:32 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes you might kind of shed more light on that
27/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, the academic year in India starts from August 2024.
27/12/23, 6:35 PM - +263 77 795 2977: OK noted
27/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/12/23, 6:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
27/12/23, 6:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/12/23, 6:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 6:37 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Following
27/12/23, 6:39 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Ooh I see the students in the picture are looking so excited
27/12/23, 6:41 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Looking forward to that
27/12/23, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed it was heartwarming to meet them finally, I hope you are excited to see Anesu in this picture for next year.
27/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yesss quite excited you can say that again
27/12/23, 6:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
27/12/23, 6:52 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Thank you so much for the assurance
27/12/23, 6:53 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Together we will make it
27/12/23, 6:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
27/12/23, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
27/12/23, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
27/12/23, 6:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
27/12/23, 7:10 PM - +263 77 795 2977: I'm done with the benefits
27/12/23, 7:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/12/23, 7:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
27/12/23, 7:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Anesu, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/12/23, 7:29 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Whaaaw that's great
27/12/23, 7:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/12/23, 7:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/12/23, 7:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 7:47 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Certainly
27/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
27/12/23, 7:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/12/23, 8:11 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes please
27/12/23, 8:11 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Network down
27/12/23, 8:24 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Can we meet tomorrow Kirti phone battery about to die
27/12/23, 8:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263777952977 I completely understand that network can be a challenge, surely we can connect tomorrow at 01:00 pm CAT, may I know if you are alright with the time?
28/12/23, 12:06 AM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes I will be available
28/12/23, 1:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Anesu,

I hope this message finds you in good health. In continuation of our earlier conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
28/12/23, 1:24 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 1:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so may I know if you are clear so far?
28/12/23, 1:27 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
28/12/23, 1:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
28/12/23, 1:34 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Not yet
28/12/23, 1:34 PM - +263 71 870 6208: In the situation that u have failed what will you do
28/12/23, 1:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand, if after getting the offer letter one fails to pay the registration fee as per the deadlines given by the university, the university shall revoke the letter, however, if discuss it with us openly regarding your challenges, we might be able to assist you with extension if the academic board considers your concerns.
28/12/23, 1:43 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Honestly speaking now my family is having financial instabilities so the registration fee is kinda heavy for us to pay within a short period of time mentioned above  because 900 USD  its more way than  my mother receives a month
28/12/23, 1:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263718706208 I completely understand and thank you for letting me know that, please do not worry the above dates mentioned are just an example for your understanding and with me here to assist you I will make sure that we work on this together so that you do not go through this concern, you just need to keep your faith in us.
28/12/23, 1:46 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Okay thanks
28/12/23, 1:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Explain
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
28/12/23, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
28/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
28/12/23, 2:06 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 2:27 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Understood
28/12/23, 2:28 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
28/12/23, 2:30 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 2:35 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
28/12/23, 2:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
28/12/23, 2:45 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes i am
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
28/12/23, 2:47 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes
28/12/23, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
28/12/23, 2:52 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
28/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 71 870 6208: O.k.
28/12/23, 2:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 71 870 6208: Nope
28/12/23, 3:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
28/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 77 795 2977: Yes

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
