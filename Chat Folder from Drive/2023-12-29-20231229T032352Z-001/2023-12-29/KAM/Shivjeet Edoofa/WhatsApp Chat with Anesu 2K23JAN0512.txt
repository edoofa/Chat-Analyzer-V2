26/12/23, 7:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening dear parents and Anesu.

I hope you are doing well today.  It has been a while since the last time we were connected, I have also been occupied with the university officials at the same time. Hence I would like to take this opportunity and Inquire about the condition of Anesu as of now. And if she is getting better please let me know if you are comfortable to proceed with the admission process?
26/12/23, 9:57 PM - +263 77 353 6620: He has improved very well. The challenge I have is that of money . I have exhausted my resources but I certainly want he  to be enrolled in the universities of your country (India). I don't know if you can help in any way. He has finished his exams and is waiting for the results

I was not able to connect with you the previous day as I was occupied with a meeting with the academic board. Regarding our previous conversation. I would like to let you know that I am sorry to hear that it might be a tough situation. With that being said, may I know what are your current plans for Anesu's higher education?

I was occupied with numerous calls with teh university officials as it is the month end and we are in constant talks about the performance and the registrations. As much as I wanted to proceed with the session my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
