As I was going through my accounts for my student who has the payment deadline tomorrow. I am making sure that they make it without any problems as possible. Hence I suggest you make the payment in he morning so that the amount is reflected in India during office hours and so that we can share the same with the university officials.

Thank you for sharing the payment receipt of your university Registration Fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly. However, as you have mentioned you made the payment long ago. Could you please let me know of the date when you made the payment for the same?
