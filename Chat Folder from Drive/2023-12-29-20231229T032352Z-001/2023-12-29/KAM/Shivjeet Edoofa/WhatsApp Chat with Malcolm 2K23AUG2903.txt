28/12/23, 9:04 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Malcolm. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

As per the recent conversation that you had with Mr. Milan, it has been noted that you were supposed to make the payment of $200 each month. Hence, I want to take an update on you if you were able to make the payment for this month as we have already exceeded the deadline. I will be having a meeting with the university officials tomorrow and will be discussing the same with them. I do not want this delay to affect your scholarship. Hence, may I know if you might be able to share an update about the second payment if not made the payment yet? Will you be able to make it by 5:00 PM tomorrow?
