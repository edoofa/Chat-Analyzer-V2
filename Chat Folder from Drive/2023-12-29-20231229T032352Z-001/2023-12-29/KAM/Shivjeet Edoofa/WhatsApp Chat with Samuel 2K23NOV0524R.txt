28/12/23, 6:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

As it has been a while since the last time we were connected I was occupied with the university officials. May I know how are you doing today?
28/12/23, 6:30 PM - +263 78 324 9174: We are doing fine, thank you and you
28/12/23, 7:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process.
28/12/23, 7:55 PM - +263 78 324 9174: Yes we are
28/12/23, 7:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
28/12/23, 8:01 PM - +263 78 324 9174: Yes, can we start depositing Feb, as for now we are busy covering fees for him to go back to school. But If I manage Jan I will let you know
28/12/23, 8:06 PM - +263 78 324 9174: Will I be using the same account
28/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly we can proceed with that.
28/12/23, 8:20 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
28/12/23, 8:40 PM - +263 78 757 2788: I can talk to them first
28/12/23, 9:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As much as I wanted to proceed with the session my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/12/23, 11:08 PM - +263 78 757 2788: Thank you
