As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
188 - 04 Dec 2023 06:47PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
189 - 04 Dec 2023 06:47PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.  Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
193 - 04 Dec 2023 07:34PM - +27 71 707 0139: I have no queries I understand everything and I am happy to have this opportunity to further my child 's education through this program

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps
195 - 04 Dec 2023 07:50PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India.

203 - 04 Dec 2023 03:35PM - +263 78 008 5885: 2. Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference in human rights and civil rights.  Rights are things that you are legally entitled to, while duties are things that you are legally obligated to do. Rights are often seen as positive while duties are seen as negative.However, both are important in creating a just and fair society.For example the right to free speech is seen as positive because it allows people to express themselves freely.Whilst the duty to pay taxes is seen as negative as it requires people to give up their money.But both are necessary for a functioning society. As for the difference between human rights and civil rights, human rights are considered to be universal as they apply to all people regardless of nationality or citizenship.Civil rights on the other hand are specific to a particular country or jurisdiction and may vary from place to place.  3.What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney?  There are a few key differences between prosecutors and attorneys. First, prosecutors work for the government, while attorneys can work for either the government or private clients. Second, prosecutors have the responsibility of deciding whether or not to press charges against someone, while attorneys defend their clients against those charges. Also, prosecutors have the burden of proof in a criminal case, meaning they must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. On the other hand, attorneys have the responsibility of presenting a strong defense for their clients. Certainly! Another key difference between prosecutors and attorneys is their approach to a case. Prosecutors have the goal of obtaining a conviction, while attorneys have the goal of protecting their client's rights and interests. This often leads to different strategies being used by each side. For example, a prosecutor may try to build a strong case against the defendant by using evidence and testimony to prove guilt, while an attorney may try to challenge the evidence or discredit the testimony in order to create reasonable doubt.  4. Which branch of law are you most interested in persuing civil, corporate or criminal and why?  I'm interested in persuing civil law. Civil law is the branch of law which deals with non criminal disputes between individuals, business or organisations. These disputes include things like branch of contract, personal injury, property damage and more.lm interested in this branch of law as l would help to resolve these disputes.Also civil law is a very broad area of law that covers a wide range of topics. This means that they are many different career paths that can be persued after graduation.Also civil law is often less adversarial than other areas of law, which can make it more enjoyable and rewarding field to work. It is often less stressful than other areas of law since there is usually less at stake in civil cases . Finally, civil law can be a very intellectually stimulating field since it often involves complex legal issues and problem solving.  5.  What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with an example.  First,l believe that l have skills that will make me a successful lawyer since I have strong communication skills.It is highlighted as l was the Projects Officer of the Eastern Eagles Rovers Scouts Club at my school. I was the one who was responsible for presenting club proposals to the school stuff through meetings which were successful.Also lm good at problem solving and at one point there were few students at our school who were unable to register for their final exams because of financial problems,l was able to come up with an idea to conduct a short term income generating project and as a club we were able to support them financially.
281 - 04 Dec 2023 06:27PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?

In contrast,auditing focuses on verifying the accuracy of the financial statements and judging if the financial statements genuinely represent the financial position of the business. Accounting is about compiling financial data a d crafting reports whereas, auditing is about reviewing financial information to ensure accuracy. Accounting is preparing financial documents, monitoring day to day bookkeeping for a firm's operations,and preparing and filing tax forms whilst auditing is verifying the accuracy of financial statements and tax filings and search for clues as to why some figure don't quite add up. Accounting is a daily process of recording financial transactions whilst auditing is a periodic process that focuses on ensuring legality of financial statements. In accounting, there is consultation of clients about how they can improve their financial position based on the data but in auditing,simply report on whether or not the data is compliant and correct. In accounting there are deliveries of  income statements and balance sheets whilst in auditing there ris only delivery of an audit report. I'm accounting,reporting is done to employers or clients whilst in auditing, reporting is done to shareholders or legal entities. The scope of accounting is determined by the client or employer whilst the scope of auditing is determined by the law. Accounting covers all transactions, records and statements having financial implications,while auditing mainly covers final financial statements and records.

335 - 04 Dec 2023 07:26PM - +27 74 649 0272: Meaning  at this University they don't do B.A Sociology or they can not offer her B.A Sociology
336 - 04 Dec 2023 07:52PM - Ashi Edoofa: @27746490272 According to her application, Sharmaine is found eligible for B.A L.L.B, which is why they have not offered her the course in B.A Sociology, however the university does have a course in this field.
337 - 04 Dec 2023 07:55PM - +27 74 649 0272: And Sharmaine she really not interested in going B.A L.L.B  what so ever.
338 - 04 Dec 2023 07:59PM - +27 74 649 0272: So I guess this means we are back to 0
331 - 04 Dec 2023 02:45PM - +27 74 649 0272: U can share with mi Sharmaine's Offer letter from MVN

339 - 04 Dec 2023 08:26PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that's correct. As per the application approved by the MVN University for Sharmaine, they have decided to offer her a scholarship for the degree in law that's the reason she is able to secure a higher quantum of scholarship as well. However, if you feel that Sharmaine is not interested in the same degree, I would encourage you to have a conversation with her and ask her to connect with me.
340 - 04 Dec 2023 08:26PM - Ashi Edoofa: This will help me to understand her concerns and guide her toward the right career path because if you compare the career opportunities in Law with the opportunities in Sociology. The course in Law takes the lead, and that's the reason the university has recommended the course in Law for Sharmaine in the first place. With that said, if you are only enquiring about the degree in Sociology I believe Sharmaine already has an offer letter from Galgotias University with the same course.

Secondly we are still working on issues of fees and other financial requirements by the time her results come out we will be in the position to pay the required funds.

79 - 04 Dec 2023 06:29PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.  If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
80 - 04 Dec 2023 06:30PM - +263 71 480 1825: Okay noted, We may start
81 - 04 Dec 2023 06:48PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
82 - 04 Dec 2023 06:50PM - +263 71 480 1825: Okay I'm done you may go ahead and explain
83 - 04 Dec 2023 06:57PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
84 - 04 Dec 2023 06:57PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.
85 - 04 Dec 2023 06:58PM - +263 71 480 1825: Yes they are clear , but when will I receive the SOP
86 - 04 Dec 2023 07:08PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will you share them really soon.
87 - 04 Dec 2023 07:08PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-  *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
88 - 04 Dec 2023 07:08PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.  I hope you are following?
89 - 04 Dec 2023 07:12PM - +263 71 480 1825: Ok
90 - 04 Dec 2023 07:13PM - +263 71 480 1825: Yes I'm following we may proceed...
91 - 04 Dec 2023 07:33PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-  *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
92 - 04 Dec 2023 07:34PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.  I hope these are clear as well?
93 - 04 Dec 2023 07:50PM - +263 71 480 1825: Thank you  it was very clear!
94 - 04 Dec 2023 07:53PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

The fourth video is about the preparation for interactive sessions with the schools and statement od purpose (SOP) ,three things are needed for university placement 1) Documents 2) recommendations from counselors 3) SOP It also states that the SOP should convince schools why they should enroll you, solid achievement results should also be stated also the skills and strengths and should also have a vision on why you want to study that coarse, Also the reasons on why your choosing that school,should also shoe ones resourcefulness Should also show your unique traits and goals and it should also convince the admission board

Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
111 - 04 Dec 2023 07:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools.

Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
112 - 04 Dec 2023 07:50PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions.

122 - 04 Dec 2023 06:35PM - +263 77 393 9614: Yes we are ready
123 - 04 Dec 2023 06:49PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
127 - 04 Dec 2023 06:54PM - +263 77 393 9614: Yes we do understand that but if that happened what will you do to help us so that we are left with one
128 - 04 Dec 2023 07:00PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed we will be there to guide you through the same. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
129 - 04 Dec 2023 07:00PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
130 - 04 Dec 2023 07:01PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
131 - 04 Dec 2023 07:04PM - +263 77 883 6494: Yes we have discussed about it
132 - 04 Dec 2023 07:29PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
133 - 04 Dec 2023 07:54PM - +263 77 883 6494: Yes we are on the same page
134 - 04 Dec 2023 08:10PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
135 - 04 Dec 2023 08:10PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $800 per annum Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship) Miscellaneous Fee: $1000 Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)  Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum
136 - 04 Dec 2023 08:10PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
129 - 04 Dec 2023 07:00PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee.

136 - 04 Dec 2023 08:10PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
137 - 04 Dec 2023 08:12PM - +263 77 883 6494: Yes we have taken note of it
138 - 04 Dec 2023 08:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
136 - 04 Dec 2023 08:10PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?

139 - 04 Dec 2023 08:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000= $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.  Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.

142 - 04 Dec 2023 04:07PM - +263 71 560 8314: No
143 - 04 Dec 2023 04:08PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, in the 11th month you will be guided to open a FBC Mastercard account with the deposit of $150. Why do you have to do this is because when you apply for the Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement and this is for that. We know it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 in FBC, so, we have planned it accordingly.
146 - 04 Dec 2023 04:14PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly that would be wise. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose.  Have you understood?
147 - 04 Dec 2023 04:15PM - +263 71 560 8314: Um no
148 - 04 Dec 2023 04:15PM - +263 71 560 8314: Can you explain a bit
149 - 04 Dec 2023 04:18PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, between the 16th and 20th months, a span of 6 months, you have the option to deposit $150 per month with Edoofa. This money can be used for your fees when necessary. Alternatively, you also have the choice to keep this total amount of $900 with you during this period. It's completely up to you how you'd prefer to manage this. Does that make sense?
150 - 04 Dec 2023 04:20PM - +263 71 560 8314: Okay

161 - 04 Dec 2023 06:52PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great and my weekend was great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with today’s session? <This message was edited>
162 - 04 Dec 2023 06:54PM - +263 77 118 4986: Yes we can proceed
163 - 04 Dec 2023 06:59PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
164 - 04 Dec 2023 07:04PM - +263 77 118 4986: Yes I do understand
165 - 04 Dec 2023 07:28PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
166 - 04 Dec 2023 07:28PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $350 per annum Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship) Miscellaneous Fee: $1000 Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)  Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
167 - 04 Dec 2023 07:28PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
168 - 04 Dec 2023 07:34PM - +263 77 118 4986: Well noted
169 - 04 Dec 2023 08:12PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
164 - 04 Dec 2023 07:04PM - +263 77 118 4986: Yes I do understand

170 - 04 Dec 2023 08:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $175 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.  Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
171 - 04 Dec 2023 08:16PM - +263 77 118 4986: Well explained  and  noted as well
172 - 04 Dec 2023 08:20PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
173 - 04 Dec 2023 08:20PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.

174 - 04 Dec 2023 08:20PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
175 - 04 Dec 2023 08:21PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.  Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

89 - 04 Dec 2023 07:53PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
92 - 04 Dec 2023 08:33PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
95 - 04 Dec 2023 08:40PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.  With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

128 - 04 Dec 2023 06:54PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.  Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
129 - 04 Dec 2023 06:55PM - +263 78 337 9287: <Media omitted>
130 - 04 Dec 2023 06:56PM - +263 78 337 9287: The information is accurate.
133 - 04 Dec 2023 07:07PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
134 - 04 Dec 2023 07:07PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
135 - 04 Dec 2023 07:07PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
136 - 04 Dec 2023 07:07PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
137 - 04 Dec 2023 07:08PM - +263 78 337 9287: I am aware of that .
138 - 04 Dec 2023 07:30PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
139 - 04 Dec 2023 07:30PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
140 - 04 Dec 2023 07:30PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
141 - 04 Dec 2023 07:39PM - +263 78 337 9287: He did told me .
142 - 04 Dec 2023 07:48PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
146 - 04 Dec 2023 07:52PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
147 - 04 Dec 2023 07:53PM - +263 78 337 9287: Well noted
148 - 04 Dec 2023 07:54PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
149 - 04 Dec 2023 07:54PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.  Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
150 - 04 Dec 2023 07:56PM - +263 78 337 9287: Okay.l get you
151 - 04 Dec 2023 08:34PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
152 - 04 Dec 2023 08:34PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your ""Earn While You Learn"" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
153 - 04 Dec 2023 08:34PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
154 - 04 Dec 2023 08:34PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.  Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

It's unfortunate that my son Panashe can not proceed with the enrollment with edoofa scholarship program to India as he has a problem with changing of diet, it  has a great impact on his health hence we cannot continue with the admission process. As per our agreement, it is written that enrollment fee of $350 is refunded if a student can not proceed with Edoofa scholarship program. It is easier for us to operate as per our agreement for future sake, I've got relatives who would like to be enrolled in the Edoofa scholarship program to India & I think we should continue spreading the good terms offered by Edoofa.

Change of diet can be indeed find challenging and hence the university will provide you the option to cook your own food inside the accomodation. In addition to this you will be living with your local community inside the campus where you can share the same cuisines and dishes. This has done by you seniors as well for the past couple of years and they are happy with it.

With EWYL you will be helping you tuition fees by reducing them and hence helping your parents at the same time by reducing their financial problems.

Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.  With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

145 - 04 Dec 2023 07:53PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose. <This message was edited>
146 - 04 Dec 2023 07:53PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.
147 - 04 Dec 2023 07:55PM - +263 77 198 7801: Very clear sir

148 - 04 Dec 2023 07:55PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-  *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
149 - 04 Dec 2023 07:55PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.  I hope you are following?
150 - 04 Dec 2023 07:57PM - +263 77 198 7801: Yes am following and it is understandable
151 - 04 Dec 2023 08:34PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
152 - 04 Dec 2023 08:34PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -  *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
153 - 04 Dec 2023 08:34PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.  I hope these are clear as well?",No,No

232 - 04 Dec 2023 08:16PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
233 - 04 Dec 2023 08:17PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
234 - 04 Dec 2023 08:17PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?

452 - 04 Dec 2023 07:28PM - +263 78 524 3459: The challenge was that as I have told you before sir my parents are no longer employed so I was looking forward to rely on my sister but she failed because she is still at school so she had to go back to school from her practice on which she used to earn some money. That's the challenge sir

121 - 04 Dec 2023 03:59PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with today’s session?
122 - 04 Dec 2023 04:08PM - +263 77 336 8037: Yes we are ready sir
123 - 04 Dec 2023 04:09PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to ask if you have any concerns you'd like to share regarding our past conversation.
124 - 04 Dec 2023 04:10PM - +263 78 909 8049: noo we don't have
125 - 04 Dec 2023 04:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now with further continuation. The reason is on the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will start to work on the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities so as to secure the scholarship and seat in the university. The earlier the seats are reserved, the higher the chances of securing a maximum quantum of scholarship, the higher the scholarship is the lesser the fee is and not only that, by securing the seat we are also entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university and not the new structure which will be implemented in January 2025. To continue, when we apply to the university, you will be given the letter of intent where the fee, scholarship and registration fee will be mentioned.
126 - 04 Dec 2023 04:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained by the counselor during the enrollment, the registration fee is a part of the first-year university fee which is paid to reserve the seat in the university. It varies from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. Now, from the $1500 which is saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university to reserve the seat. For example, if the registration fee is $700, that means, Edoofa will pay $700 from the $1500 which you paid in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $800 which will again be paid to the university when you come to India. This becomes a great relief to the parent as they don’t have to pay anything immediately after the student comes to India. The $800 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year as it will be mentioned in the admission letter.
127 - 04 Dec 2023 04:13PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: What do you think about it?
128 - 04 Dec 2023 04:18PM - +263 77 336 8037: I think its really a good idea
129 - 04 Dec 2023 04:20PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, you must be wondering about the remaining 10 months, right?
130 - 04 Dec 2023 04:20PM - +263 77 336 8037: Yes
131 - 04 Dec 2023 04:47PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in the 11th month you will be guided to open a FBC Mastercard account with the deposit of $150. Why do you have to do this is because when you apply for the Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement and this is for that. We know it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 in FBC, so, we have planned it accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th month, which is 4 months.
132 - 04 Dec 2023 04:47PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months is completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process, the bank statement will act as one of the required documents and you will receive the visa. Once the visa is received, you can deposit from the deposits of 4 months in FBC, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you to utilize the money as well. How does it sound?

Now continuing with the last two steps -  *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
93 - 04 Dec 2023 08:35PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-  *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
90 - 04 Dec 2023 07:51PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

92 - 04 Dec 2023 08:35PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that.

Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
93 - 04 Dec 2023 08:35PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.

Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.  With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one.

113 - 04 Dec 2023 08:39PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
114 - 04 Dec 2023 08:39PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.

This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.

Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
181 - 04 Dec 2023 07:28PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
182 - 04 Dec 2023 07:29PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?

184 - 04 Dec 2023 08:06PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.  I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?

103 - 04 Dec 2023 06:08PM - +263 78 298 5241: Not at all
104 - 04 Dec 2023 06:09PM - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

146 - 04 Dec 2023 06:36PM - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?

These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
94 - 04 Dec 2023 05:05PM - Arshita: * Webinars:* - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.

97 - 04 Dec 2023 05:11PM - +263 71 562 2820: Ofcourse I will be benefiting It's a great opportunity
98 - 04 Dec 2023 06:03PM - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.  *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

(The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

200 - 04 Dec 2023 02:36PM - Arshita: Please note that it is true that India doesn't permit international students to do part-time jobs during their studies and this is the reason, we have the Earn While You Learn Program which is online offering students the opportunity to reduce their cost of education significantly based on their efforts and at the same time opening the opportunity to gain employability skills. *Let me correct you at the second part as graduates can do attachments or work in India* . we have students who received paid attachments and organizations hire students and can help in converting their student visa to work visa
201 - 04 Dec 2023 02:37PM - +27 74 913 4096: Oh okay thank you for clearing that misconception
202 - 04 Dec 2023 02:49PM - Arshita: May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
203 - 04 Dec 2023 02:53PM - +27 74 913 4096: It is quite expensive but they think it will be better with the help of the scholarship and with the scholarship credit from the EWYL program and they will manage
204 - 04 Dec 2023 02:58PM - Arshita: I do understand and appreciate the willingness of your family to invest in your career, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
206 - 04 Dec 2023 03:12PM - Arshita: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
207 - 04 Dec 2023 03:12PM - Arshita: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
208 - 04 Dec 2023 03:22PM - +27 74 913 4096: Yes I am
209 - 04 Dec 2023 03:29PM - Arshita: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me  1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?  2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?  3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?  5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?  6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.  7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
210 - 04 Dec 2023 03:55PM - +27 74 913 4096: 1. BA in Geography  2.India  3. $2000 or more per year  4.$750  5.$350 and if found eligible it will be paid in 7 days  6.  The Ewyl program ..it is the Earn while you learn program.This is whereby students are given the opportunity to learn whilst getting important job skills from the very beginning of their University year.  All this happens whilst students are studying. Students earn a lost of money in the form of scholarship credits..Students can either work online..part time as well as full time. This also helps students to finance their education themselves  7.yes

155 - 04 Dec 2023 03:23PM - Austin: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
156 - 04 Dec 2023 04:08PM - +263 77 305 2518: Yes, yes, I did ,comparing to Zimbabwean education Edoofa scholarship program is way cheaper and affordable.
157 - 04 Dec 2023 04:41PM - Austin: Indeed,Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19 - 04 Dec 2023 04:04PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20 - 04 Dec 2023 04:04PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

My father passed away when i was nine years old in the year 2016. I completed my primary education at a school called Libala Adventist School. I completed junior secondary education at a school called Terranova Boarding and Day school. I finally completed my senior secondary education from a school known as Kings Palace Academy. My highest education level is twelvth grade, am currently awaiting my results that are likely to be out by february. I would like to study computer engineering, because ive always dreamed of being a computer engineer since i was in eighth grade. Also, the world is evolving into an age of computers and eventually most jobs will be replaced by computers. Therefore, i would like to study computer engineering in order to make the world a better place and to satisfy the needs of people. My mother is an accounts assistant, my father passed away in the year 2016. My mothers highest education level is a diploma in Foundation In Accounting (FIA). She has been supporting me for my education since primary school. She will still continue to support me in my higher education abroad.

40 - 04 Dec 2023 04:06PM - +260 97 8806769: In a quest to uphold Mwakas curiosity of inventions which began at a tender age, I encouraged him to follow his dream. His passion to invent different things led him to participate in a Jets fair in lower secondary which saw him attain third place for inventing a wind turbine. His quest to attain a scholarship and the determination he has exerted towards this has reminded me of the time shortly after the father's death when I sat him down before he went to boarding school. My words were"" you will make it."" You will even do better than your friends who have both parents. Follow your father's legacy and aim to even surpass him. Make him proud. Am seeing that relentless spirit to achieve. To succeed against all odds. Thankyou for this privilege. I know that once results are out and my son is accepted by your institution he will make a difference. Not an ordinary one but an extraordinary one.

30 - 04 Dec 2023 10:04AM - +263 77 901 8933: Good morning Am sorry for the late reply
31 - 04 Dec 2023 10:10AM - Gurvinder: Please address this.
32 - 04 Dec 2023 10:19AM - +263 77 901 8933: Okay, so, my name is Shaloam Ncube, am a girl aged 17, am heading towards my last year in High School, that is, upper 6. Am a simple girl who loves playing soccer and other co-curricular activities. I am studying Economics, Accounting and Business Studies, I wish to study business management. My strength is in explaining and solving theoretical questions and my weakness is in maths, I am being raised by a single mother, she's a teacher at a school in Bulawayo called Inyanda High School
76 - 04 Dec 2023 12:22PM - +263 77 901 8933: First of all, if I get into the Edoofa program, I will be able to study without worrying about tuition fee, accomodation and all, this will enable me to be fully focused on my studies and my dreams, and once my mind is set on achieving something, I make sure I definitely achieve it,  The Earn While You Learn program will also help with the small stuff that I might need,  As for where I see myself after 5 years of completing the course, let me start with immediately after I finish the course, I would obviously look for a well paying job, and save a percentage of my monthly salary, while making a business plan,  I would probably do that for the whole of the first year and the second year, depending on my salary,  Then,I will open my business, also depending on the type of business I would be interested in, whether I will buy shares in a very reputable company, or franchising, or open my own business,  If all goes well, I would want my business to be up and successfully running in atleast a year or a year and a half,  Then, after that I would make sure to achieve all my dreams, and also, since I would be a proud Edoofian, how else can I thank the Edoofian family than to also help in the insuring of scholarships to students that would be in the same situation as I am in now, which would be five years ago, by then....
77 - 04 Dec 2023 12:27PM - Gurvinder: That is really great Shaloam, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,  However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.  Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
78 - 04 Dec 2023 12:29PM - +263 77 901 8933: Of cause sir, this is something that I have planned for a very long time, I cannot let my dreams to shatter just like that
79 - 04 Dec 2023 12:31PM - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
80 - 04 Dec 2023 12:41PM - +263 77 901 8933: What would assure that I achieve my dreams than an Internationally recognised degree, To get a good paying job, I have to have experience and skills that every company would want to have as their own, skills that will set my company aside from any other, If my company has a good reputation, I would obviously get a lot of investors and customers, also, from the experience that I would get from another country, I would be able to know the type of people I want as employees to manage my business in an extra ordinary way, and besides that, am just a person that loves socialising and adventure,
81 - 04 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
82 - 04 Dec 2023 01:10PM - +263 77 901 8933: I never really thought about that, but you have given me food for thoughts, this is really something to think about
83 - 04 Dec 2023 01:11PM - Gurvinder: Yes do share your thoughts.
84 - 04 Dec 2023 01:16PM - +263 77 901 8933: There's a girl who is the former Head Girl of our  school, she gives free extra lessons to A'level students doing the same subjects as she did too, I think I would also do the same or have a program like Edoofa that will offer scholarships to students
85 - 04 Dec 2023 01:22PM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Shaloam, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don’t you agree? <This message was edited>",No,No

75 - 04 Dec 2023 12:32PM - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* calls for the candidates with attention to detail, reasoning and critical judgment skills. The students having an ability to draft formal documents with precision are perfect for this course. This course is made for the students who are able to formulate sound arguments, can think laterally and possess problem solving skills.
76 - 04 Dec 2023 12:32PM - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:  *1) Legal Advisor* The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.  *2) Lawyer* As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.  *3) Public Prosecutor* A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.  *4) Judge* This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.  *5) Company Secretary* This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.  A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

198 - 04 Dec 2023 09:54AM - Gurvinder: Tafadzwa as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*",No,Yes

Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22 - 04 Dec 2023 11:45AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23 - 04 Dec 2023 11:45AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

26 - 04 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Gurvinder: Okay so Tinotenda, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
27 - 04 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
28 - 04 Dec 2023 01:07PM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29 - 04 Dec 2023 03:32PM - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?

81 - 04 Dec 2023 03:30PM - Gurvinder: Please reply through text.
82 - 04 Dec 2023 03:30PM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

75 - 04 Dec 2023 11:19AM - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!

48 - 04 Dec 2023 01:11PM - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-  1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program? 2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
49 - 04 Dec 2023 01:29PM - +232 99 635766: 1. My understanding of the Edoofa program is that to help the students to further their education give them knowledge so that they can be the future leaders of tomorrow and they will also help others who are in need of education bring developments in a country and motivate others to learn 2. the financial aspect of the program is that I didn't able to afford that kind of money like i told you the last time I didn't have support am just managing things are hard, that is all I have to say
50 - 04 Dec 2023 01:57PM - Harmehak: I do understand, Osman.  However did you happen to discuss with your parents?

54 - 04 Dec 2023 02:08PM - Harmehak: In simple words Osman, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

55 - 04 Dec 2023 02:08PM - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.  What are your thoughts on the same?

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*",No,No

The ability to earn money while gaining valuable work experience and building a professional network can be very beneficial for one's career. Plus, the opportunity to learn about new technologies and develop skills in an innovative environment could be very rewarding.
195 - 04 Dec 2023 04:58PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.

197 - 04 Dec 2023 07:13PM - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling: 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off  3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn  *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.  After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.

Many many people are involved in putting together funds for the children.  On that note we have set regulations like the fact that people proceed to local universities after A-level.  Studies outside the country are done under a confirmed 100% scholarship.  Remember that it's more then the 3200 per year.  Who will cover his air ticket and medical insurance cover?  If he does not get a job to earn credits the institution will have to cover the unforeseen expenditure - that is not feasible.

137 - 04 Dec 2023 01:16PM - Pallika Edoofa: I'm interested in understanding if, as mentioned by your mother, you have the intention to pursue the current program. Additionally, she has affirmed that you plan to further your education at local universities after completing A levels.
171 - 04 Dec 2023 05:24PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
172 - 04 Dec 2023 05:24PM - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
173 - 04 Dec 2023 05:24PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process.
174 - 04 Dec 2023 05:28PM - +263 78 058 4029: Yess they are clear and precise
175 - 04 Dec 2023 05:42PM - +44 7818 717994: Thank you Ms Pallika. So Innocent has not yet been accepted into the scholarship programme but in order to advance with his application he/we would need to pay a $350 fee reimbursable if he does not receive the scholarship. If he does, the $350 will go towards his future fees. Is that right?
176 - 04 Dec 2023 06:52PM - Pallika Edoofa: Let me please help you with the process. Indeed, Innocent has not yet qualified for the scholarship program. We have now come to the end of the first stage which is the counselling session after which you will be given time to discuss as a family and then we will begin the eligibility check stage for Innocent. If he passes the eligibility check, he will receive the Acceptance Letter through the Edoofa program only after which you are supposed to pay the enrollment fee.
177 - 04 Dec 2023 06:52PM - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is for *-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *-Earn While You Learn Program and training* *-University sessions and interactions* *-A guaranteed scholarship seat* *-Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
178 - 04 Dec 2023 07:08PM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*  I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
179 - 04 Dec 2023 07:08PM - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready* *2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India* *3. Also, the financial aspects involved* *4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

103 - 04 Dec 2023 04:35PM - +263 78 944 1188: My family  can  not  afford for  now
104 - 04 Dec 2023 04:36PM - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Honest, I understand that!!  let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.   And do you know how that is done?
105 - 04 Dec 2023 04:39PM - +263 78 944 1188: It's  good   to provide  with  work
106 - 04 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the   *Earn While You Learn Program*   The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
107 - 04 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.   *The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
108 - 04 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
109 - 04 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are: Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
110 - 04 Dec 2023 04:55PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics
115 - 04 Dec 2023 05:34PM - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed   If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.   *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
116 - 04 Dec 2023 05:39PM - +263 78 944 1188: Please  help  us  ot benefit
117 - 04 Dec 2023 05:54PM - Pallika Edoofa: sure
118 - 04 Dec 2023 05:54PM - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling: 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.  2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off  3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn  *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.  After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.

130 - 04 Dec 2023 07:51PM - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

I have also been served with the Indo Zambia Bank account number I will use in my future transactions. The balance will  be 5% of $350 based on rate at the time plus the $150. Thanks.
340 - 04 Dec 2023 02:27PM - +260 96 6408899: Am some what  confused here ... not clear with additional charges🤷‍♀️
341 - 04 Dec 2023 03:53PM - Sahil Edoofa: you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge.  The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been immense because of which students like Muchimba are able to pursue their education in India.

427 - 02 Dec 2023 01:49PM - Sahil Edoofa: Melyndah's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways  *1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.  Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself.  This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.  *2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:-* Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels.  *3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

255 - 02 Dec 2023 06:12PM - Sahil Edoofa: I truly understand that making sacrifices initially can be challenging, but it's an investment in your child's future. From my experience, I've witnessed countless families facing similar challenges at the start, and eventually, it transformed not just their child's life but the lives of future generations. This could be a life-changing opportunity for your child, and I encourage you to consider it as a valuable investment in their future.

312 - 04 Dec 2023 03:17PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
313 - 04 Dec 2023 03:17PM - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

313 - 04 Dec 2023 06:08PM - +263 78 999 2252: We discussed as a family the importance of every member getting involved in the decision making process, particularly where it involves tertiary education. We therefore deliberated on their ability to meet the required fee payment standards and they gave their word that they would strive to their fullest to meet the demands.  What they would like to ask is your forbearance in raising the funds in a harsh African economic environment as they strive to work out the best for their child's education. They wanted to find out if there is room for other concessionary payment terms

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tatenda's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.  Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?

377 - 04 Dec 2023 01:30PM - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Tatenda's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tatenda's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days.

I passed my Ordinary levels with flying colours. I went on proceed into Advanced level this year and waiting for the results with all hope.Here's one way to answer: ""My ambition is to be come an Engineer who is charismatic to change the livelihood of the people in the past growing technology but mostly those who are poor. I have worked hard  to achieve this goal by many sleepless nights and accompanied by prayer . I believe that if I keep working hard and stay focused, I can make my ambition a reality.""

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?

105 - 04 Dec 2023 09:00PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Nokutenda! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people.

A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior.

Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.  BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.  *Career Prospects*  What can you do with a BA degree in Psychology?  The graduates of BA Psychology have a lot of opportunities ahead, both in academics and in the job sector.  *Jobs*  The graduates of this course get various opportunities to work in many different fields in both the private sector and the government sector.

It is very important to understand the current scholarship scenario. A fully funded scholarship is the dream of every African student, but continuous academic excellence is one of the most significant criteria for fully funded scholarships and only a handful of exceptionally meritorious students meet that. First of all, it’s important to understand that Edoofa isn't a philanthropic and charitable organization and so this $10 Million scholarship fund isn't coming from a charity which will be distributed to students. We are a social, for-profit organization which aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities.RATION? Answer: Edoofa is looking for bright, meritorious and deserving students who have a passion for education and a long term vision. Students get a free career counselling session and check their eligibility. If they meet the program requirements and eligibility criteria, they are declared eligible by the Edoofa Academic Board. On completion of the program fee formalities, Edoofa Admission teams work on the student’s application, and statement of purpose and send the final student application along with Edoofa's recommendation to colleges and universities in India, after which the students are awarded a scholarship. counselling

It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food. B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.  The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.  Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.  Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.  Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.  Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.

As a student it made me realise that studying in India could provide an immersive experience of this rich cultural diversity, allowing an international student like me to learn and appreciate different traditions,customs and practices.  However one of the main reasons behind my desire to study in India is to pursue my career. As I had mentioned in my description about myself  that I want to become a Paediatrician doctor,my research shows that skilled and efficient Paediatricians are highly in demand in India as about 26 million children are born in India every year.  I also discovered that Pediatrics is a good profession in India as it works well in both rural as well as urban India which could give me an opportunity to explore a new environment while showcasing my skills 😌 Above all I believe that if given the opportunity to go study abroad,it would be a great opportunity that would allow me to develop new skills and techniques in a different environment

This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship.

77 - 04 Dec 2023 02:49PM - +27 67 235 2935: Well as a student that desires to become a Paediatrician, I researched more about this career before I fell in love with it and to also acquire knowledge about it . A Paediatrician doctor is a medical  that provides a health care service for infants and young children.They specialise in many areas and they are trained to diagnose and treat common illnesses from minor health problems to serious diseases in children. What inspired me to consider this career is the love I have for children. I have experience with babysitting children and I found infants, toddlers and children funny and filled with bright energy even though they can be a lot of work but I understood from the very moment I decided to pursue Pediatrics as a career that this job is meaningful and respected  .  In the year 2022,we had a career week at school and I happened to meet a Paediatrician who inspired me more. She explained to me that being a Paediatrician doctor is more than just treating illnesses. She mentioned that watching children grow, change and also ensuring that children are achieving milestones in their growth, behaviour and skills is a rewarding experience to every Paediatrician doctor.  I have researched characteristics and skills required to become a Paediatrician which includes Good communication skills Compassion Problem solving skills A way with working with kids and be very observant which I am confident that I portrait all of these skills.😌  From my perspective, pursuing this career will allow me to build relationships with families and see children grow over the years. This will give me an opportunity to share my expertise and also  allow me as a Paediatrician doctor to help the families resolve concerns that they have about their children and ensure that their children are healthy 😌
78 - 04 Dec 2023 03:42PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your expressed desire to work in the healthcare sector is truly commendable and reflects a deep sense of compassion and dedication to making a positive impact on people's lives. Your commitment to contributing to the well-being of others through a career in healthcare showcases not only your professional aspirations but also a genuine concern for the welfare of the community. The healthcare field greatly benefits from individuals like you who bring a combination of empathy, resilience, and a strong sense of responsibility. Your decision to embark on this path indicates a noble intention to be part of a sector that plays a vital role in enhancing the quality of life for individuals and communities at large, Trish! However, could you please share why you didn't pursue Biology in your 12th Grade? I believe it is a very crucial science/medical subject, isn't it?
79 - 04 Dec 2023 03:44PM - +27 67 235 2935: I did pursue biology but in South Africa they call it Life Sciences 😌
80 - 04 Dec 2023 03:59PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Trish. Could you kindly provide information on the specific subjects that fall under the category of ""Physical Sciences""?

82 - 04 Dec 2023 04:17PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India, he/she has to crack the entrance exam, NEET, which selects only a limited number of students from a vast pool of applicants. NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) is challenging due to its comprehensive syllabus, fierce competition, and the need to excel in Biology, Physics, and Chemistry, making it a demanding examination for aspiring medical students.

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
145 - 04 Dec 2023 08:44PM - +263 71 886 6629: I am not familiar with it.
146 - 04 Dec 2023 08:44PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Urshler! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

Please type your answers in the group directly.  2. For MCQ Questions you can directly type the options  3.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a “NO CHANGE” option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.  Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6. outdo A) NO CHANGE B) defeat C) outperform D) outweigh  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE B) can pollute waterways, C) could have polluted waterways, D) has polluted waterway’s,  8.scientists; and A) NO CHANGE B) scientists: and C) scientists, and D) scientists, and,  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed A) where it is now.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways .

B   Section 5   The Rwandan Genocide, a bloody and horrific period that took place in Rwanda from April to July 1994. An estimated 800000 Tutsi and Hutu tribe members were killed by Hutu extremists. The economy was in ruins and infrastructure had been destroyed. The country began a process of recovery and reconstruction with a focus on reconsolidation and unity amount the Hutu and Tutsi tribes. Significant efforts were made to improve the economy and infrastructure and to to promote peace and stability. New infrastructure was built including roads bridges and public buildings. Many of these projects were funded by international Aid Organisations including the World bank and the United Nations. One of the most notable projects was the construction of the Kigali Construction Centre which was completed in 2010. Other notable buildings include the Gisozi Genocide Memorial Centre and the Kigali International Airport. These projects have helped to improve the quality of life for Rwandans and to promote economic development in the country.  Despite it's troubled history Rwanda has become a beacon of hope to ather African countries in the areas of economic development, poverty reduction, gender equality and good governance. Under the leadership of president Paul Kegame, the country has achieved impressive economic growth rates, reduced poverty levels and increased access to basic services. Rwanda has made significant progress in promoting gender equality with women making over 60% of it's parliament. In addition Rwanda has been praised for it's efforts to combat corruption and improve transparency.  Since the genocide, Rwanda has made significant progress in primary, secondary and tertiary education. They have made strides in improving the quality of education with a focus on teacher's training and improving learning environments. The country has seen an increase in the number of students pursuing higher education with the Rwandan Government investing in both public and private universities. The Rwandan health system has undergone a dramatic transformation since the genocide. They have made investments in the health sector with a focus on primary health care. The life expectancy has increased from 48 in 2000 to 68 in recent years and infant mortality has also declined from 121 deaths to 29 deaths per 1000 live births. Rwanda has also made improvements in it's sports sector. They have invested in infrastructure, including construction of new sports stadiums and the development of sports facilities. The country has also seen success on the international stage with athletes from Rwanda competing in events such as the Olympics and The African Games  These achievements have made Rwanda a model for other African countries looking to emulate it's success.  Section 6  My inspirational story is that of former United States President  Barack Obama. He was born as a normal black child in Hawaii with a white American mother and a black Kenyan father and somehow he managed to become the first black president of the United States Of America  Growing up when he was just two years old his family moved Indonesia when his father got a job offer there and this inspires me because my dad also has to move from Zimbabwe to Mozambique so that he could take care of us. Barack moved back to the States after four years and I believe this had an impact on his life as he was immersed into different cultures and I believe this shaped his views upon life as well as his future political views.  After finishing his high school he got scholarships and student loans so that he could finance his tertiary university as he went to a college in California and studied political sciences. After two years he transfered to Columbia University in New York City. Years later he to Harvard Law School and he furthered his studies. Education played a huge role in Obama's success and this is one of the reasons why I find education important to my life.  Obama's political career started slowly as he was elected as a democrat to the Illinois Senate and he served eight years. He was later on elected as the United States Senate in 2004 and served for another four years before running for President and winning in 2008. He was re-elected again in 2012 and served another successful term.  Barack Obama's story is very inspirational to me because against the odds he managed to conquer and lead one of the strongest nations on earth. He became president despite all the set backs, humble beginnings and the obvious racial segregation. He went against the odds and and I intend to do the same in order to make it and be successful. Barack Obama will go down in history as one of the best Presidents of America and he is my inspiration.",No,Yes

I am here to discuss the application of Chantell  Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session  Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
57 - 04 Dec 2023 01:04PM - +263 77 120 5513: Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to deal with you one on one I was waiting for this chance please tell us about Edofa and how it helps people.
58 - 04 Dec 2023 01:26PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!  You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

35 - 04 Dec 2023 03:48PM - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
36 - 04 Dec 2023 03:48PM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.  Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

Please type your answers in the group directly.  2. For MCQ Questions you can directly type the options  3.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a “NO CHANGE” option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.

From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

The country has made significant progress in terms of economic development, infrastructure, and social stability. The country has also made a strong commitment to reconciliation and justice, with a focus on building a society based on shared values of peace, unity, and reconciliation. Today, Rwanda is considered one of the safest countries in Africa and has seen rapid economic growth. However, the country still faces challenges related to poverty, inequality, and unemployment. But overall, the past 16 years have seen Rwanda move from a place of great tragedy to one of hope and progress.   Section 6 Another inspiring story is that of a girl named Rachel. When Rachel was 10 years old, her mother passed away from a terminal illness. This left Rachel feeling lost and alone. But with the help of her father and community, she was able to find the strength to move forward. She worked hard to stay on top of her schoolwork and became a role model for other children who had lost parents. Today, Rachel is a successful young woman who is pursuing her dreams with the same determination and resilience that got her through her mother's death.",No,Yes

162 - 04 Dec 2023 12:26PM - +263 78 715 9643: Okay i understand
163 - 04 Dec 2023 12:26PM - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future.  Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
164 - 04 Dec 2023 12:26PM - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
165 - 04 Dec 2023 12:27PM - +263 78 715 9643: No this I actually my first time
166 - 04 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
167 - 04 Dec 2023 01:26PM - +263 78 715 9643: No i have no knowledge about that
168 - 04 Dec 2023 01:34PM - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
169 - 04 Dec 2023 01:34PM - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation
170 - 04 Dec 2023 01:34PM - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
172 - 04 Dec 2023 01:38PM - +263 78 715 9643: How then do you get into the program
173 - 04 Dec 2023 01:38PM - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
174 - 04 Dec 2023 01:41PM - +263 78 715 9643: Okay I understand
175 - 04 Dec 2023 01:48PM - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now brief  you about the Earn While You Learn program?
176 - 04 Dec 2023 01:49PM - +263 78 715 9643: Yes
177 - 04 Dec 2023 04:35PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
178 - 04 Dec 2023 04:35PM - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
179 - 04 Dec 2023 04:35PM - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

299 - 02 Dec 2023 06:17PM - +263 78 964 1414: In Rwanda after 16 years the government makes no distinction between its two main ethnic groups, Hutus and Tutsis: ethnic identity cards are banned and national unity is promoted. But 10 years ago, the ethnic distinction was evident and turned deadly. From April to July 1994, Hutu extremists slaughtered 800,000 innocent Tutsis and moderate Hutus during a 100-day genocide while the world stood by, inactive and silent.""The world silently watched and chose not to act. ""Remembering Rwanda seeks not only to remember both the victims and survivors of the genocide, but also to pay tribute to the remarkable courage and vision of Rwandans who are undertaking the painful, difficult work of reconciliation and reconstruction.For the past 16 years the Africa Program has co-hosted events with the United States Institute of Peace, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Council on Foreign Relations, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Refugees International and other groups to commemorate the horrific events of 1994 and generate public conversation on lessons learned from the failure to act and about the international capacity to prevent such atrocities, or to intervene in the event of mass killings In the past 16 years Rwanda's government has restored schools, hospitals, and basic civil services and ratified a new constitution, while the country has seen modest, steady economic growth. Kagame's Rwanda remains a traumatized society. Human rights advocates have criticized restrictions placed on the media and opposition parties. Other serious problems remain. The average life expectancy is only 40 years and an estimated 60 percent of Rwandans live below the poverty line.The government adopted a policy of open return and reconciliation for many of the former soldiers who participated in the genocide. In addition, the government has released tens of thousands of Hutus from prison who have been kept

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1.

271 - 04 Dec 2023 01:32PM - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*. Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.",No,No

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?

131 - 04 Dec 2023 03:19PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
132 - 04 Dec 2023 04:17PM - +263 73 242 8998: This is a good thank, surely it helps and transforms the lives of the generality of our students and families.

If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.  *Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
