The next step involves the student undergoing an Eligibility Check Interview with Edoofa Program Directors and Academic Board members. Upon successfully clearing the interview, the student is issued The Letter of Acceptance.

Subsequently, the student collaborates with Edoofa's Admissions team to prepare their Statement of Purpose (SOP) while simultaneously finalizing their university admission. Concurrently, students work closely with Earn While You Learn Mentors to acquire skills and accumulate scholarship credits.
