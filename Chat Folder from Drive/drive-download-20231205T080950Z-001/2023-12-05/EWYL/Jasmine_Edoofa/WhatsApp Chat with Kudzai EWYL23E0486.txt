24/08/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 813 5023: I understand that the most effective way through which I can execute our project which is community building I have ti create a WhatsApp group.The next step is to identify the right students who can be part of that group .The goal is to reach out to the large and broad students and provide them with the necessary information about Edoofa before the counseling session insuring that they were very prepared and have a counseling experience.To find the right students I can start by getting in touch with my school mates who are currently in form six or those who have already passed their A level
24/08/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 813 5023: I will have to later share the link in that group so that other students can join using that link
24/08/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 813 5023: And I have to write a convincing message which says “for those who would want to fulfill their dreams of higher education at very affordable prices can join my group

29/08/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
29/08/23, 8:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
29/08/23, 8:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
29/08/23, 8:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/08/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
29/08/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 813 5023: That is great to know
29/08/23, 9:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 813 5023: Alright enjoy your festival of Rakhi

31/08/23, 8:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
31/08/23, 8:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
31/08/23, 8:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 813 5023: I understand that my task is to reach out to local schools in my region and connect with the headmaster to introduce them to the Edoofa program 
I should create the list of all the higher secondary schools in my area and I should start with my own school and connect with the principal and the headmaster 
I can reach out to them via WhatsApp or phone call and share why I joined Edoofa in the first place 
I should explain how I planned my future and then share the details of the Edoofa with them 
Afterwards I should ask if they are interested in setting up an online meeting with the Edoofa program director to explore potential collaborations
31/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 813 5023: The goal of the project is to arrange the meeting between a school headmaster and the Edoofa program director
31/08/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Kudzai.

​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share in detail about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
31/08/23, 8:48 am - +263 77 813 5023: I should share the details with you once I’ve communicated with the headmaster
31/08/23, 8:48 am - +263 77 813 5023: Thank you
31/08/23, 8:49 am - +263 77 813 5023: Alright Ma’am I understand you perfectly
31/08/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.

31/08/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
31/08/23, 8:56 am - +263 77 813 5023: Q1.Kambuzuma One Secondary School.No it is not connected with Edoofa 
Q2.Introduce myself,Explain what Edoofa Program is ,Explain my experience with Edoofa,Share details of the Edoofa program 
Q3.Harare Province
31/08/23, 8:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
31/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 77 813 5023: Yes I agree
31/08/23, 9:01 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
31/08/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 813 5023: Alright
31/08/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
31/08/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 813 5023: Yes ma’am

04/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 813 5023: Alright
04/09/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
04/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 813 5023: Alright
04/09/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

08/09/23, 8:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good morning*
I hope this message finds you in high spirits. I want to begin by sharing my excitement about the recent orientation program we organised. Meeting all the students in person was a truly delightful experience. It's been a journey of 7-8 months of staying in touch, and finally having the opportunity to meet face-to-face added a whole new dimension to our connection.
_*I can't express how much I'm looking forward to the day when we can meet in person as well. That moment will surely be something special.*_

Now, let's seize the day and dive into our session. Are you all ready?
08/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
14/09/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Kudzai, 
How are you doing? It has been quite a while since we have had a proper detailed conversation. I am bothered that you will be left behind from the rest of the students so if you are facing any challenges then I would really appreciate it if you come to me and let me know. 

I am here to help you and take out the solution in the best way possible. So, what is actually stopping you from taking one hour in a day out for your sessions? Please feel free to discuss them with me. <This message was edited>
14/09/23, 8:48 am - +263 77 813 5023: Good Morning Ms Jasmine 
How are you doing
14/09/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well Kudzai.
14/09/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Can you please read this message
14/09/23, 8:49 am - +263 77 813 5023: Actually there really is no problem Thanks for your concern 

The only time I would miss a session is probably because I will be out of data
14/09/23, 8:51 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, but I have been observing that whenever you come for the session, I don't get all your attention and you reply late or leave the session in between. So, I thought that you must be going through some challenge.
14/09/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 813 5023: I am sorry about that 
Usually most times we conduct our sessions that’s the time when I will be occupied with chores
14/09/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 813 5023: But I promise to change
14/09/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I trust you Kudzai. So, we have finished our discussions about the EWYL Program and the projects. Do you have any doubts in that?
14/09/23, 8:54 am - +263 77 813 5023: No Ma’am no doubts
14/09/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So last time I shared a different number with you which is called EWYL LINE. Do you remember?
14/09/23, 8:56 am - +263 77 813 5023: Yes I remember
14/09/23, 8:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Let us continue from there.
14/09/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 813 5023: Alright
14/09/23, 9:00 am - Jasmine Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Jasmine, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
14/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 813 5023: I already did that Ma’am
14/09/23, 9:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, That is great
14/09/23, 9:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
14/09/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 813 5023: Alright Ma’am
14/09/23, 9:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
14/09/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 813 5023: Alright Ma’am
14/09/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Kindly pay attention to the part where I said that you have to come to the EWYL LINE everyday and say *I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN*
14/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 813 5023: I’ve take note of that
14/09/23, 9:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now you can go to the Line and drop the message the message. I will get back t you there after our session.
14/09/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 813 5023: Alright Ma’am
14/09/23, 9:19 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, It was lovely talking to you Kudzai
14/09/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 813 5023: It was lovely talking to you too Ms Jasmine
16/09/23, 10:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning*

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 10:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to discuss.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
