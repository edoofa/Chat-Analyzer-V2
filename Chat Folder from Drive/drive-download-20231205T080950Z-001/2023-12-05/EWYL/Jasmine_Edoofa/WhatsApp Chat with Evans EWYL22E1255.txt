As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

29/08/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

10/10/23, 4:10 pm - +91 90560 42596: this  one is correct
10/10/23, 4:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like to draw your attention to a few important matters. Currently, the admissions for the year 2025 have not yet commenced. Therefore, it is crucial that you refrain from submitting any forms for the 2025 batch at this time. However, I have an alternate suggestion that can prove beneficial. Gather all the 2025 forms in one designated location and engage with those students. Your primary objective should be to address any queries or concerns they may have, while also providing them with the necessary guidance and motivation to pursue their aspirations in India. 

By following this approach, you can ensure that not a single form goes to waste. Rest assured, as soon as the 2025 admissions open, I will promptly inform you, enabling you to submit all the 2025 forms in a consolidated manner.
10/10/23, 4:13 pm - +91 90560 42596: Thanks mam
11/10/23, 3:49 pm - +91 90560 42596: It was good mam .12,13,16,17 and 18 October
11/10/23, 3:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, let's have our discussion quickly so that you can make the most of your remaining study time.
11/10/23, 3:54 pm - +91 90560 42596: OK
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let's begin our session for today. First, kindly respond to the following questions with either "Yes" or "No":
1. Have you shared your photograph with me?
2. Have you provided your Facebook username?
3. Have you shared your Instagram username?
4. Have you written a review on Google and shared the screenshot with me?
5 Have you written a review on Facebook and shared the screenshot with me?
6. Have you shared your date of birth with me?
11/10/23, 4:02 pm - +91 90560 42596: Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
11/10/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'd like to discuss our "Star of the Month" initiative, which is our $300 plan. Let me clarify why we introduced this plan. It's designed to help you achieve maximum results with minimal effort. 

However, it's crucial to use your smart strategies when reaching out to students. Are you employing effective tactics maximizing the potential of this plan and using smart methods to make the most out of this plan?
11/10/23, 4:11 pm - +91 90560 42596: Yes I'm using it
11/10/23, 4:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us don't have a good understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, we expect that the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
11/10/23, 4:15 pm - +91 90560 42596: Yes
11/10/23, 4:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 4:17 pm - +91 90560 42596: Yes mam
11/10/23, 4:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 13-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Friday. Will you be able to do that?
11/10/23, 4:22 pm - +91 90560 42596: OK I will
11/10/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, it was wonderful talking to you. I hope you had a good time as well. I truly value your active participation. I'll be in touch soon, and I wish you the best of luck with your exams.
11/10/23, 4:26 pm - +91 90560 42596: Thank you mam
