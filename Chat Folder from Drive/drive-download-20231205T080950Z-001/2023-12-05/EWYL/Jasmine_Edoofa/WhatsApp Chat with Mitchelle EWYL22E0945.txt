25/11/23, 2:18 pm - +91 89681 69958: Spirit of competition
Being a competitor is something which is nice because you can be motivated and you can get many ideas to execute. Let me take for example, going to school, before coming to lndia when I was form 6, l wasn't good enough in my studies but because of the spirit of competition in my class, l studied harder and harder,and l passed with flying colors. Spirit of competition is good sometimes because it motivate ti become successful. It also helps to innovate yourself to become someone who is successful.
