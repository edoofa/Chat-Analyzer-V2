17/11/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
17/11/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Melisa, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
17/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 050 5370: Olk Ma'am.

I would like to go for the bachelor's degree in Sociology right. My main aim or goal is to interact with people and get to know their problems then at least find some solutions to their problems even awareness campaigns. I think the EWYL program will help me get more information about how to be a real and effective sociologist for I alone can not afford without your hand
17/11/23, 8:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your desire to embark on a journey toward a Sociology degree is laudable, fueled by a genuine interest in engaging with people and tackling societal challenges. Your commitment to using your skills for the betterment of others, including through awareness campaigns, is admirable. Despite financial constraints, your dedication to pursuing your academic and professional goals is commendable. 💯
17/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 050 5370: Thank you so much ma'am 🙏
17/11/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
17/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 050 5370: No can you explain further
17/11/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
17/11/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
17/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 050 5370: I understand now thank you
17/11/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
17/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 050 5370: Ok ma'am nice to know them. Thank you
17/11/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you.
17/11/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
17/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 050 5370: Yes yes ma'am
17/11/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 5 minutes should be enough.

17/11/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
17/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 050 5370: Yeah so inspiring
17/11/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?

17/11/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

20/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 050 5370: Basing from my own understanding, the EWYL program will help me link with many organisations and business people as well as local people including my own age mates which is beneficial to my side. As I can see I can confidently tell that the above activities are there to enhance my connections and good relationship with different organisations which may also help in the recruitment of other learners like me to be part of Edoofa. This may also help me acquire skills that will help me when seeking a job. The above information also made it clear on the issue of awareness and acquiring skills that suit the current situations in the current world.
20/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your insight into how these activities can enhance relationships with different organizations, potentially aiding in the recruitment of fellow learners, reflects a keen understanding of the program's broader impact. Acquiring skills relevant to the current job market is a smart approach, and it's great that you can see the potential for personal and professional development through these connections.
20/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
20/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

20/11/23, 9:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.

20/11/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 050 5370: Ok ma'am you were trying to say that the more I get in touch with other people and spread the word and how Edoofa is helping me out the more group of edoofians grow which is also beneficial to my own country for we reduce the level of illiteracy . It is also good for me to start sharing the good works of Edoofa to my family, friends, neighbors as I advance to large groups of people. This also help me get great opportunity to associate with huge companies and discuss business aspects of the company
20/11/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's amazing!

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
21/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 050 5370: Ok ma'am let me start the task. Does it have any limit
21/11/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
21/11/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: No, it doesn't
21/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 050 5370: Ok ma'am
21/11/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
21/11/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*MELISA/ADITI/21NOV23*
21/11/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
21/11/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
21/11/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

21/11/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 050 5370: I heard you out ma'am
21/11/23, 9:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
21/11/23, 9:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

22/11/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
22/11/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 050 5370: Ok ma'am
22/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 050 5370: I heard you ma'am

Ok the task before me says that I should get in touch with local high school principals and inform them about Edoofa and how I am benefiting from it . If they are willing I will let them connect with you for more information . Is that so ma'am
22/11/23, 8:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have. However I’ll explain this project quickly for you in 2 steps:  I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
22/11/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 050 5370: This one is clear ma'am
22/11/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap the project

So let's begin with our today's session.
23/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 050 5370: Yes I am good ma'am. Let's proceed
23/11/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
23/11/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Is your school connected with Edoofa?

May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
23/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 050 5370: For now I don't have ma'am but I can seek for the contacts today
23/11/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay!
23/11/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
23/11/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

23/11/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

23/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 050 5370: It's ok ma'am I will create and send you a username
23/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 050 5370: Let me send my smiling photo
23/11/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
23/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 050 5370: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: You look lovely🌸
23/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 050 5370: Is it clear ma'am
23/11/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
23/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 050 5370: Ooooh thank you
23/11/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
23/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 050 5370: Monday and Thursday
23/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Noted.
23/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
23/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
23/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
23/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
23/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
23/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 050 5370: Ok ma'am
23/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 050 5370: Ok
23/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
23/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 050 5370: What can I do with this
23/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
23/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: This
23/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: And also this.
23/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 050 5370: Ok ma'am
23/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 050 5370: Oooh wonderful
23/11/23, 9:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Melisa, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
