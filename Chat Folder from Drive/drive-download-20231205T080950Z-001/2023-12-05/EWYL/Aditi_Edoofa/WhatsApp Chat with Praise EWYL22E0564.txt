29/09/23, 12:06 pm - +91 78273 08969: Dear Praise,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.
30/09/23, 6:21 am - +263 71 711 2340: Good day Ma'am. I am so sorry. I pray that you get better soon Ma'am. It was really great having you as my mentor getting to learn a lot of things. Thank you so much Ma'am for all the investment you in me. I appreciate you so much.

04/10/23, 4:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So for that, I would like you to share some information filled in this form with me:

- Name and Details of the Competition

- Your Position 

- A message to fellow Edoofians
09/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 711 2340: Good morning Ma'am. I am a proud edoofian.
I would want to apologize for a late response I was sick and I had to go to the hospital and I was admitted because of cholera, i am sorry Ma'am.
09/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 711 2340: Yes that's very true i participated in a Capital Markets Quiz High School Competitions. We were a team of 4 from our school and i was the girl amongst 3 boys.
So the competition was mainly a business studies competition and i being a science student i participated 😊.
We were completing against 4 other group A Schools with each team having Commercial students. It was really tough because w as a school we were a team of all Science students with no knowledge of business studies or commercials. We attained the second position and we failed only by 5 points.



My message to my fellow Edoofians.

Hey! I am a proud edoofian. I am Praise Parwaringira an upper six student at Harare high school, the first born out of 5,a leader and an upcoming Entrepreneur. 
The competition made me realize that i can be anything in this world and I can achieve anything. This was an opportunity i could say no to since I knew nothing about business studies, yes just like what the commercial students did. They all refused and we called out to just stand in for our school.
It's not about being the very best at what you do but being able to take risks. In a world with a limitation of finances , money can be limited but your dreams cannot be limited. Dream big and you achieve big.
09/10/23, 12:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Praise!
I'm truly sorry to hear that you were unwell and had to be admitted to the hospital due to cholera. Please don't worry about the late response – your health is the top priority. I hope you're feeling better now.
09/10/23, 12:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Congratulations on your remarkable achievement in the Capital Markets Quiz High School Competition! It's inspiring to see you, a science student, step out of your comfort zone and excel in a business studies competition. Your message to fellow Edoofians about taking risks and dreaming big is both empowering and encouraging. Keep up the great work, Praise!
09/10/23, 12:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Furthermore, I'd be delighted to see an individual photo of you from this fantastic day, proudly displaying your well-deserved prize.
