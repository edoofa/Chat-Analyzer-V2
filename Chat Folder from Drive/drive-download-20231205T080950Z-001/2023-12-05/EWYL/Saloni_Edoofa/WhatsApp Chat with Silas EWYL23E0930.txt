It would be highly appreciated if each of you could take a moment to introduce yourselves.
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 227 4762: I'm an aunt to Silas..
27/11/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to welcome you to the group, I am sure you will witness tremendous growth and splendid transition in Silas as we move ahead in this journey🚀
27/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Thank you
27/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Silas, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
27/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 717 9272: My long term goals is to become A computer Engineer and earn while you learn will help me to reduce the costs of my education to reach my goals
27/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great Silas, and remember that I am always there with you to fulfill these!
27/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 717 9272: No
27/11/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/11/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
27/11/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
27/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Thank you

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

28/11/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
28/11/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
28/11/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Thank you maam
28/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Did you see the video?

28/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you grasped about me?
28/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 717 9272: You seem to be a very friendly mentor and always want to help for people to achieve better in future
28/11/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much Silas,  I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes
28/11/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes maam
28/11/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will end the session today and will meet on Thursday since due to a personal commitment, I will not be able to take the session tomorrow. So see you on Thursday⚡

How are you?

May we begin with our session?
30/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 717 9272: How are you maam
30/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you!
30/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Welcome ma'am
30/11/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

30/11/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
30/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Almost all sections maam
30/11/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome Silas!
30/11/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Silas?
30/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 717 9272: That's great maam
30/11/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?

30/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Silas- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
30/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 717 9272: It's all about Earn while learn program where edoofians are connecting with different company owners and decision makers in these companies ,sharing with them the vision of the Edoofa

01/12/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 717 9272: On searching of the companies you should consider the nature of companies you are looking for and also the founders of the companies and mostly you should look for the companies that are student centric
01/12/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Silas, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
