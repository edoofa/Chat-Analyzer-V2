04/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Currently the term results are not where l am so l dont know if you can hold on so that l can ask someone to send them to me and l can give them to you.

04/12/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 709 6076: A level combination : Pure Mathematics ,Biology and Chemistry
04/12/23, 5:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Payne, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
04/12/23, 5:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
04/12/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Yes l am very confident for sure.
04/12/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Of course yes ,l did some research concerning foreign education with the aim of achieving a better insight about it.
04/12/23, 5:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Ok , thank you very much.
04/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Let me go through it.
04/12/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Ok , well understood .
04/12/23, 7:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Payne
04/12/23, 7:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 7:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Payne, I would like to know if you were interested in Medical Field why have not you opted Physics in your A level?
04/12/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 710 4113: Mr Njini P, was my Vice Principal at Mkoba Teachers College. I am happy to hear this.
04/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Well, actually biology was my favourite subject since O level therefore l opted Biology since it was also part of my dream carrier. The other issue also was that l seem to understand biology better than physics, so l think those are the reasons.
04/12/23, 7:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Payne, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
 
*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*Physiotherapy*

*Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

*Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

*Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*, etc

Would you like me to explain any of these programs for you?
04/12/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Well l understand. But here in Zimbabwe we usually do a combination of three subjects in science department. We are asked to choose between maths , chemistry (which are compulsory), then we choose between physics and chemistry. Except those few who does an additional fourth subject will then opt all the four subjects. Besides that it's impossible to take biology physics and chemistry in schools as they are not part of school offered combination without Mathematics.
04/12/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 709 6076: So l kindly want to ask if Mathematics is also considered as well.
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Payne
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this once
04/12/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Well, you can expand on Bachelor of Science in microbiology.
04/12/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 709 6076: I mean physics and biology are not compulsory .
04/12/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 709 6076: Yes l did.
