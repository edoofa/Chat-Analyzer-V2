15/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 761 8757: *Question*: What is Edoofa scholarship program in India?
*Answer*: However, through the famed Edoofa program, Edoofa has reserved seats with Indian universities and colleges for selected students who as a part of the Edoofa program are offered scholarships ranging from 50-100% of their tuition fees. 

According to my research and what I found out
15/11/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Sandra, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/11/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

15/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Ohh how much is it 😀
15/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Is it a 50% scolarship or
15/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: I would be discussing everything in detail, Sandra.
15/11/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate your query?
15/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 761 8757: I wanted to ask if it's  a 50,,percent scolarship or if it's fully funded scolarship
15/11/23, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
15/11/23, 9:23 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
15/11/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Soo by applying my tuition would be reduced so that it becomes easy for me to come there
15/11/23, 11:33 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Ok maaam
16/11/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
16/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Yes
16/11/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Yes, Edoofa is a scholarship program Sandra
16/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Ok I see ...

16/11/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you earlier, now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours were over by the time you got back, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
17/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Yess
17/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind delayed responses?
17/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Poor network this side and it will be during school hours

17/11/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: So did you happen to share our discussion from yesterday with your brother?
17/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Yesss

17/11/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so could he acknowledge the same in this group?
17/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Yess
17/11/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: You can request him please.
17/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 500 3662: Good day, 

Indeed, Sandra approached me and we discussed the issue and our position is that we are prepared to make contributions towards the remaining percentage, so we will sponsor
17/11/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Hello Mr Sitotombe,

It's good to have you following and acknowledge your support to Sandra,

So far, firstly do you have any queries for me?
17/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 500 3662: I have no queries, thank you
17/11/23, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
17/11/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
17/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT, do ensure active participation so that we can conclude the counseling session and proceed with further stages.

I wish you all a blessed evening ahead!
17/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Ok
18/11/23, 9:13 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
18/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 761 8757: Yess
18/11/23, 9:34 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the same, Sandra?
18/11/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 761 8757: Yess
18/11/23, 9:47 am - Harmehak: Alright please, now before we begin with our session, would you like to ask anything?
18/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 761 8757: Nothing
18/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 761 8757: Noo
18/11/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?

18/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Yess
18/11/23, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind such inactive participation in that case?

Child...it's my passion..I want to make a difference in the world through medicine..I have a strong desire to help people with medical conditions and I believe i can learn new things through medicine
18/11/23, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: Duly received, Sandra

It's great to know of your passion to help others!

So did you reasearch about the requirements for medicine too?
18/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Not yet
18/11/23, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
18/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Ok
18/11/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
18/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Ok these arethe only ones left
18/11/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

As physics in the requirement to pursue Medicine here in India, Sandra.
18/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 761 8757: I do biology and chemistry not physics
18/11/23, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
18/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 761 8757: So it's possible for me to do medicine with biology n chemistry
18/11/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: No please.

Physics, Biology and Chemistry together are a mandatory requirement.
18/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 761 8757: I only do two of the subjects mentioned biology and chemistry and maths
18/11/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please.

These are your options as per your subject combination.
18/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Ook ook I see

21/11/23, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please, Sandra!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
21/11/23, 8:26 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you, so now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Kindly note that your active participation is very important aspect while the determination of scholarship percentage.*
22/11/23, 7:50 am - +263 78 761 8757: Noo Tell me please.
22/11/23, 7:50 am - +263 78 761 8757: Ok
22/11/23, 9:03 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
22/11/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 761 8757: Yes
22/11/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: I await your response, Sandra.
22/11/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Yeah
22/11/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright
22/11/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Let me add, about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Ohh
22/11/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
22/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 761 8757: There is the earn while you learn program
22/11/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Yes, what are your thoughts on the discussion of financial aspect so far?
22/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 761 8757: It's good so if a person gets the scolarship the tuition is reduced
22/11/23, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: Yes please.
22/11/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Sandra, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
22/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Yess true
22/11/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: So going through these costs, are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Sandra?
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Yess I see now
22/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
22/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/11/23, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

22/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Oh ok it's a live stream
22/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Ok
22/11/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 761 8757: Ok ok
22/11/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/11/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: I understand
22/11/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 15 minutes. 

Are you ready?

22/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
23/11/23, 9:06 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
23/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 761 8757: Yes
23/11/23, 9:22 am - Harmehak: Sandra, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/11/23, 9:22 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 761 8757: Ok ok I see
23/11/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: This was a question please, Sandra.
23/11/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 761 8757: Around $1500
23/11/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/11/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: Sandra,Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 761 8757: Okk I see I see it yess
23/11/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/11/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/11/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 761 8757: Ohhh ok
23/11/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/11/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
23/11/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/11/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 761 8757: Ook ok I see it
23/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 761 8757: I understand it
23/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 761 8757: Ook step6 is last step
23/11/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Yes please
23/11/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/11/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
23/11/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
23/11/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/11/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

23/11/23, 11:08 am - +263 78 761 8757: Ok ok I see
23/11/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/11/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/11/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
