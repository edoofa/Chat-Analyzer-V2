I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.
30/11/23, 5:44 pm - +260 762344394: Thank u very much and I have to say thank u for giving me an opportunity  to be part of your scholarship program.
30/11/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please, Peter.
30/11/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Well Peter, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
30/11/23, 5:46 pm - +260 762344394: Madam sorry again it's mapalo
30/11/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: Since all three of the names had similar contact,

The same caused a technical error.

Kindly excuse the same please.
30/11/23, 5:47 pm - +260 762344394: Very much I feel like the delivery and mentorship is far much better.
30/11/23, 5:47 pm - +260 762344394: Understood
30/11/23, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

And would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
30/11/23, 5:52 pm - +260 762344394: Definitely!!
30/11/23, 6:02 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
30/11/23, 6:04 pm - +260 762344394: When say financially. In wat ways would they help me financially.
30/11/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: Mapalo, firstly, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
30/11/23, 6:10 pm - +260 762344394: Oh I understand But does your edoofa scholarship program offer scholarships in aviation.
30/11/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, we do offer scholarships.
30/11/23, 6:17 pm - +260 762344394: Ah perfect am really loving this.
30/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So now are you clear that you would require financial support, Mapalo?
30/11/23, 6:18 pm - +260 762344394: Yes I am.
30/11/23, 6:19 pm - +260 762344394: But how possible is it to acquire a hundred percent scholarship in aviation
30/11/23, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: While I would brief you about the same, may I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship, Mapalo?
30/11/23, 6:24 pm - +260 762344394: According to wat u said. I think a 100% scholarship would mean that all tuition fees would be covered except for accommodation and feeding. Am I correct?
30/11/23, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: Correct!

I am glad you are thoroughly following.
30/11/23, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: So now may I know if your parents are willing to support you financially for your higher education in India, Mapalo?
30/11/23, 6:27 pm - +260 762344394: This message was deleted
30/11/23, 6:29 pm - +260 762344394: Can I give u feedback on that question after I seat down with them after they knock off from work.
30/11/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: Surely, Mapalo
30/11/23, 6:30 pm - +260 762344394: Grt, Most likely after an hour.
30/11/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Mapalo!
30/11/23, 6:31 pm - +260 762344394: No problem.
30/11/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
30/11/23, 8:15 pm - +260 96 7110023: Yes, we are willing to support Mapalo .K. Mwaba in his higher Education requurements.

01/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
01/12/23, 12:05 pm - +260 762344394: We can begin
01/12/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, please, Mr Peter.
01/12/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: How was the discussion with parents so far, Mapalo?
01/12/23, 12:11 pm - +260 762344394: It went well. They first doubted the legitimacy of this program but I was able to elaborate and explain to them what it was all about until they were finally convinced to support me financially.
01/12/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand there concerns as a parent.
01/12/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: However are they aware Felix, your friend from Canisius secondary is currently in India please?
01/12/23, 12:15 pm - +260 762344394: Yeah they are that's what actually convinced them because not only Felix by Edwin mushabati is there as well.
01/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Very correct.

Canisius secondary school is even associated with the Program please.
01/12/23, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Like you must have seen when are founders Visited Zambia too!
01/12/23, 12:17 pm - +260 762344394: Yeah true <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: So, so far are there any queries?
01/12/23, 12:19 pm - +260 762344394: Yeah just one question.
01/12/23, 12:21 pm - +260 762344394: Me who wants to be a pilot, how is the scholarship program for such fields and any examples of pilots that have benefited from this program.
01/12/23, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: I would be discussing everything in detail with you as we would proceed
01/12/23, 12:28 pm - +260 762344394: Noted Ms Harmehak we may proceed.
01/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
01/12/23, 12:36 pm - +260 762344394: I am but I did O - levels.
01/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Didn't you appear your Grade 12 exams this year?
01/12/23, 12:38 pm - +260 762344394: Yes I did madam.
01/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: A level means Grade 12 itself please.
01/12/23, 12:39 pm - +260 762344394: Oh, sorry for the misunderstanding.
01/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please
01/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: May I have the previous term's results, Mapalo?
01/12/23, 12:42 pm - +260 762344394: Alright, No problem let me get back to u.
01/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, you can type for now as well.
01/12/23, 12:58 pm - +260 762344394: Mwaba mapalo. k ( post mock results) for term 3.

01/12/23, 12:59 pm - +260 762344394: Yes madam.
01/12/23, 1:00 pm - +260 762344394: All nine.
01/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.

So what motivates you to study Aeronautical Engineering, Mapalo?
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - +260 762344394: It's not aeronautical engineering. I want to become a pilot madam.
01/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Students pursue Aeronautical/Aerospace or Mechanical Engineering if they wish to become a pilot, Mapalo.
01/12/23, 1:07 pm - +260 762344394: Please explain a bit more.
01/12/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Surely
01/12/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Now Mapalo, looking at your interests and passion for aeroplanes and becoming a pilot, let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but as your counselor I would like to highlight a few parameters

-This is a niche course that has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low

- If you opt for this branch, your scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself. At the same time, if you opt for a degree like *Mechanical Engineering*, it can help to bridge you to Aeronautical, Aerospace, Automotive, etc at the same time helps to fulfill your interests to solve challenges, to bring innovations, and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as the mother of Engineering!
01/12/23, 1:22 pm - +260 762344394: Am still confused
01/12/23, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: May I know what did you not understand please, Mapalo?
01/12/23, 1:23 pm - +260 762344394: My true passion is to fly the planes why can't I not just go to flight school.
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Let me help you have a better clarity
01/12/23, 1:31 pm - +260 762344394: Plz go on
01/12/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: It's essential to recognize that aspiring to become a pilot usually involves enrolling in an aviation school which is quite different from a normal University considering the requirement of various infrastructures and advanced facilities. Currently, we aren't associated with aviation schools, so we do not offer pilot training programs. However, for those interested in the aviation industry, we offer courses, such as aerospace engineering, Mechanical Enginnering and Bachelor of Business Administration in Aviation Management.
01/12/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: For a study who is intrigued towards learning about Aerospace, Aviation world and become a pilot, it's best to first study more about them as well.

Due to the same for your interests in the field you can opt for either of these 3 degrees.
01/12/23, 1:39 pm - +260 762344394: Oh ok let's talk about aviation management.
01/12/23, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Surely
01/12/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: While I would share the same with you, Mapalo,

May I know if as per you, venturing into the field of Management of Venturing into the study of Aeroplanes would be a better call for you?
01/12/23, 1:59 pm - +260 762344394: I think the study of aeroplanes would be better.
01/12/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: Very correct.
01/12/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: Going through the same, are you understanding how Mechanical Engineering is the degree that would help you the best for that?
01/12/23, 2:03 pm - +260 762344394: I think i would prefer aeronautical engineering.
01/12/23, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: That's surely alright, Mapalo.

However I would like to share that's costs are high for the same comparing to other courses as Aeronautical Engineering is a niche course.

Shall I brief you about the same?
01/12/23, 2:13 pm - +260 762344394: Yeah
01/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Technology in Aerospace Engineering* is a four-year undergraduate program in engineering. Minimum eligibility criteria for which is qualified A-level with Physics, and Mathematics as compulsory subjects.

All those CEO's from India wow.
01/12/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mapalo 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
01/12/23, 5:41 pm - +260 762344394: No we're not
01/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
01/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
01/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
01/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
01/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 5:50 pm - +260 762344394: What do u mean by the earn as u learn program.
01/12/23, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
01/12/23, 5:53 pm - +260 762344394: It's excellent that way students are able to have a feel of their field.
01/12/23, 5:54 pm - +260 762344394: But for the $2000 to $3000 remaining fee is it possible to have amounts less than that remaining.
01/12/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
01/12/23, 5:55 pm - +260 762344394: In a case were i was to be given like a scholarship percentage of about 80% wat would be the remaining amount.
01/12/23, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: The final percentage would depend on your results please
01/12/23, 5:57 pm - +260 762344394: Oh so in a case where I was to get 6 points. Wat would be the percentage.
01/12/23, 5:58 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
01/12/23, 6:00 pm - +260 762344394: Oh I understand, thanks for the clarity.
01/12/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful, now lets discuss the *Earn While You Learn Program* in detail!

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/12/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
01/12/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

01/12/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 6:14 pm - +260 762344394: Very encouraging!
01/12/23, 6:21 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
01/12/23, 6:27 pm - +260 762344394: Great, does the EWYL program apply for first year students.
01/12/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, it would start as soon as you are found eligible and while you are still in Zambia!

If all goes well with you, you would begin with your EWYL in this December itself.
01/12/23, 6:41 pm - +260 762344394: That would be wonderful.
01/12/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Mapalo.
01/12/23, 6:42 pm - +260 762344394: The EWYL is a promising program. I would love to get started with that
01/12/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

01/12/23, 6:46 pm - +260 762344394: Very different and far much better than other scholarship programs.
01/12/23, 6:46 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So Mapalo, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
01/12/23, 6:47 pm - +260 762344394: No problem am ready?
01/12/23, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: Mapalo, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
01/12/23, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/12/23, 6:49 pm - +260 762344394: Almost $1500+
01/12/23, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/12/23, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 6:51 pm - Harmehak: You see Mapalo, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
01/12/23, 6:52 pm - +260 762344394: Affirmitive I do.
01/12/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/12/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
01/12/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/12/23, 6:56 pm - +260 762344394: Noted.
01/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
01/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
01/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
01/12/23, 6:59 pm - +260 762344394: Please explain step four and five in simpler terms <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: After you get accepted into the program, Mapalo only after the same you pay your enrollment fee and the admissions are guaranteed.

In Step 5, you would begin with your university admission with your Admissions Officer.
01/12/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
01/12/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
01/12/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
