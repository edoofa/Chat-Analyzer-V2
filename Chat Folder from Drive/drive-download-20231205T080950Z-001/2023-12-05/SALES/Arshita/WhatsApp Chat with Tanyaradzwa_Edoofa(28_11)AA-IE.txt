Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of Agriculture?
29/11/23, 12:41 pm - +27 74 913 4096: I used to learn Agriculture in Primary. And I also learnt a lot about Agriculture at A level in my Geography subject as it has a topic called Agriculture and Food Security

29/11/23, 12:47 pm - +27 74 913 4096: My A level results are not yet out
29/11/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: Noted. 

Can you please confirm me your subjects in A level?
29/11/23, 12:48 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Economics, Geography, Business Studies and Computer science
29/11/23, 12:49 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
29/11/23, 12:49 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
29/11/23, 12:50 pm - +27 74 913 4096: I am very confident that I did well in my A level exams
29/11/23, 12:53 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
29/11/23, 12:53 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
29/11/23, 12:54 pm - +27 74 913 4096: I haven't actually applied to any University abroad as most of them open their applications early next year but it's in  my plans and goals to apply for universities abroad
29/11/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
29/11/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: Let me know once you are done

So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
29/11/23, 1:35 pm - +27 74 913 4096: According to my research about India and its education system I have discovered that the Indian Education system is quite effective but after asking from those who have learnt in India, I've discovered that some lecturers do not teach in English which might prove to be difficult for African students. I've also heard about the hostel situations regarding hygiene which was said to be quite poor. And that in India they do not allow African students to work and earn. I don't know how much truth there is to that. But I'm hoping with Edoofa that will be different from my own findings
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your knowledge
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
29/11/23, 3:30 pm - +27 74 913 4096: No..but it is quite expensive
29/11/23, 3:32 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*

01/12/23, 12:18 pm - Arshita: Greetings! 
Hope you are doing well! 

Shall we begin the session?
01/12/23, 1:00 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Yes
01/12/23, 1:03 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
01/12/23, 1:03 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Maybe
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - Arshita: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
01/12/23, 1:13 pm - +27 74 913 4096: No..do tell me
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje

01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 1:30 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
01/12/23, 1:35 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Yes..definitely
01/12/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
01/12/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 2:07 pm - +27 74 913 4096: This is great
01/12/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
01/12/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
01/12/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
01/12/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
01/12/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
01/12/23, 2:19 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
01/12/23, 2:25 pm - +27 74 913 4096: I like 2 the most
01/12/23, 2:26 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

01/12/23, 2:28 pm - +27 74 913 4096: That is great
01/12/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
01/12/23, 2:34 pm - +27 74 913 4096: My mother
01/12/23, 2:34 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with her after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
01/12/23, 2:35 pm - +27 74 913 4096: They have absolutely no problem with me studying abroad
01/12/23, 2:56 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
01/12/23, 2:56 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
01/12/23, 2:56 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
01/12/23, 2:57 pm - +27 74 913 4096: I also have the same views
01/12/23, 2:58 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
01/12/23, 2:58 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
01/12/23, 2:58 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 2:58 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
01/12/23, 3:05 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Yes
01/12/23, 3:06 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
01/12/23, 3:06 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/12/23, 3:07 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Oh okay
01/12/23, 3:08 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
01/12/23, 3:10 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Okay
01/12/23, 3:11 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 3:16 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Upto stage 6
01/12/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: No, we have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
01/12/23, 3:17 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Oh okay
01/12/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
01/12/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
01/12/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
01/12/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
01/12/23, 3:18 pm - +27 74 913 4096: I am ..thank you
01/12/23, 7:41 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
01/12/23, 7:41 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

01/12/23, 11:39 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Thank you
02/12/23, 12:06 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Hello
02/12/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: Greetings @27840806798 and @27749134096 

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
02/12/23, 12:09 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Yes
02/12/23, 12:10 pm - Arshita: It is good to connect with you today, Tanyaradzwa
I hope you are doing well
02/12/23, 12:11 pm - +27 74 913 4096: I am thanks and yourself?
02/12/23, 12:11 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you!
02/12/23, 12:11 pm - Arshita: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
02/12/23, 12:47 pm - +27 74 913 4096: My mom has been seeing all the discussions we've been having and she hasn't mentioned that she has any objections about the Edoofa Program
02/12/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: So may I know what discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
02/12/23, 1:00 pm - +27 74 913 4096: They actually have no problem with the Program. They also think it will be  a good opportunity for me to fulfill my career goals as well as my life goals.But They are a bit concerned about the employment issue. They have done some background research and it seems like in India they do not allow students to work after their studies or even during studies but otherwise they have no problem with the Edoofa Program
03/12/23, 6:19 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *12:30 pm CAT on Monday(04/12/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.
04/12/23, 1:28 pm - Arshita: Greetings! 

How are you doing?
04/12/23, 2:19 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Good and you?
04/12/23, 2:36 pm - Arshita: Please note that it is true that India doesn't permit international students to do part-time jobs during their studies and this is the reason, we have the Earn While You Learn Program which is online offering students the opportunity to reduce their cost of education significantly based on their efforts and at the same time opening the opportunity to gain employability skills. *Let me correct you at the second part as graduates can do attachments or work in India* . we have students who received paid attachments and organizations hire students and can help in converting their student visa to work visa
04/12/23, 2:37 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Oh okay thank you for clearing that misconception
04/12/23, 2:49 pm - Arshita: May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
04/12/23, 2:53 pm - +27 74 913 4096: It is quite expensive but they think it will be better with the help of the scholarship and with the scholarship credit from the EWYL program and they will manage
04/12/23, 2:58 pm - Arshita: I do understand and appreciate the willingness of your family to invest in your career, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
04/12/23, 2:58 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Yes
04/12/23, 3:12 pm - Arshita: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
04/12/23, 3:12 pm - Arshita: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
04/12/23, 3:22 pm - +27 74 913 4096: Yes I am
04/12/23, 3:29 pm - Arshita: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7.
