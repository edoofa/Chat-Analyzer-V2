I wish to pursue a career in computer engineering .For that reason I am studying Computer Science,Pure mathematics and Principles of Accounting at A level.
The current term fee at Regina Mundi is $601.00 USD.My aunt (mother's sister) and mother help each other to raise the money with my aunt playing the greater part.In Primary school,I was awarded a bursary which paid for my fees from grade 2 through to grade 7.The bursary was both academic and need based.
I am the first in a family of four children.After me are my 15 year old twin sisters with a ten year old boy being the last.We live in a high density suburb in Gweru with my mother only because my parents separated .We all  commute to and from school everyday though we are all in different schools.My mother trained an electrician but due to scarcity of jobs,she is unemployed and survives on buying and selling of wares. <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 9:38 am - Arshita: Good to know more about you. You expressed yourself genuinely. 

You can also add your aunt to the group
13/10/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 738 3233: I have added her ,thank you

May I know what motivated you to pursue a course and career in the field of computer engineering?
13/10/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 738 3233: We are living in a digital era so a career in this path will ensure I never become redundant.I n addition,since form 1 I have always been awarded the merit badge in computer science which made me realize that I have a natural strength in this field.
13/10/23, 9:54 am - Arshita: Good to see that you are motivated. 

Do you have any past experience of learning in this field specifically?
13/10/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 738 3233: Not any other besides the Computer Science subject I am doing at school.
13/10/23, 9:57 am - Arshita: That is fine

13/10/23, 10:00 am - Arshita: Noted. 

Meantime can you please confirm your subjects at A level?
13/10/23, 10:01 am - +263 78 738 3233: I am currently doing:
Computer Science
Pure Mathematics
Principles of Accounting
13/10/23, 10:02 am - Arshita: That is well noted.
13/10/23, 10:02 am - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
13/10/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 738 3233: Well noted
13/10/23, 10:05 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
13/10/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 738 3233: I have done a bit of research on foreign colleges and universities especially those which offer scholarships.I made an application to African Leadership Academy in 2022 but I did not make it in.
13/10/23, 10:09 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
13/10/23, 10:09 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 10:09 am - Arshita: Let me know once you are done.

So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform

It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.

Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system.

13/10/23, 10:53 am - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
13/10/23, 10:53 am - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
13/10/23, 10:53 am - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.

13/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 738 3233: Wow this is excellent ,I am impressed .It has further increased my interest in studying in India.
13/10/23, 11:03 am - Arshita: This message was deleted
13/10/23, 11:03 am - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
13/10/23, 11:08 am - +263 78 738 3233: All this has proven to me that India is very technologically advanced which will help me keep up rest with the modern world.Being a diligent worker that I am ,I aim to put in all my effort to ensure that I attain my goals.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
13/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 738 3233: I am not familiar with the exact charges but I know it's on the expensive side
13/10/23, 11:11 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/10/23, 11:11 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 11:11 am - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
13/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 738 3233: The cost is high but im sure that my will power and determination will motivate my mother to work out a plan and persevere to see it through.She has a strong passion for our education.
13/10/23, 11:16 am - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
13/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 738 3233: Please kindly elaborate
13/10/23, 11:19 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
13/10/23, 11:19 am - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
13/10/23, 11:19 am - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
13/10/23, 11:19 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
13/10/23, 11:19 am - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
13/10/23, 11:19 am - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje

13/10/23, 11:19 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 11:19 am - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
13/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 738 3233: Yes indeed the EWYL program will greatly assist me in lowering the financial burdens on my guardians.
13/10/23, 11:28 am - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

13/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 738 3233: Okay,I understand it.The resultant cost is very affordable and that way there are no doubts of managing to undertake and complete my studies.
13/10/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
13/10/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
13/10/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
13/10/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
13/10/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
13/10/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
13/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 738 3233: Point number 1 is the most inspirational for me because being led in the right direction is the core foundation for the achievement of goals.
13/10/23, 11:45 am - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

13/10/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 738 3233: Amazing,i would love that alongside my studies
13/10/23, 11:51 am - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
13/10/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 738 3233: My mother and aunt will help each other settle the balance
13/10/23, 11:55 am - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
13/10/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 738 3233: I will certainly discuss everything with them .My family would be more than thrilled if I am offered the opportunity to study abroad.
Thank you very much,I am looking forward to the connections
13/10/23, 11:59 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
13/10/23, 11:59 am - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
13/10/23, 11:59 am - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
13/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 738 3233: I totally agree with you on the above.In addition there is need for authentic personal identification and academic documents.
13/10/23, 12:02 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct
13/10/23, 12:02 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
13/10/23, 12:02 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
13/10/23, 12:02 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 12:02 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
13/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 738 3233: Yes please do
13/10/23, 12:06 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
13/10/23, 12:06 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
13/10/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 738 3233: Well noted, thank you
13/10/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
13/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 738 3233: Much appreciated,thank you

I hope you are doing well
14/10/23, 1:17 pm - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
14/10/23, 1:18 pm - Austin: That is great to know, did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Scholarship within your family?
14/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 738 3233: Yes I did discuss with my mother and  she is interested in the Edoofa program .She is the only present parent.
14/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 695 1156: I did  follow the1st session thank you. I am very much impressed by the Edoofa scholarship program. The session was very helpful as it helped me  gain so much insight into the program .
I would strongly recommend it for my daughter
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 695 1156: At the moment I do not have any questions, but,with your permission , I will ask if they arise as we progress
14/10/23, 1:34 pm - Austin: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career! <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 1:34 pm - Austin: That is fine, 

May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
14/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 695 1156: I noticed you put in place a payment plan that makes it easier for me as a parent to pay educational costs. In addition, the EWYL is a very helpful scheme. With such schemes in place,it makes sense to enrol under Edoofa  for higher education
14/10/23, 1:56 pm - Austin: That is right, Mrs Melani!
I am glad that you have this detailed understand and appreciate your willingness to support your child's career
14/10/23, 1:57 pm - Austin: So Kimberley, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
14/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 738 3233: 1.I will be studying
Bachelor of Computer Applications through the Edoofa program.
2.I will be studying in India under Edoofa.
3.The average cost for studies in India is approximately $6000-$8000 per annum without a scholarship.
4.The annual fee I will pay is $2000-$3000 should I be found eligible for the Edoofa program.
5.The enrollment fee for the Edoofa program was $750 but has now been reduced to $350 . Basically you're given 30 days to complete the full payment.A part payment of $200 is paid in 7 days and the balance payable is paid within the next 30 days.

 *The EWYL program*
This is a program where students are given online projects which are inline with your career goals .The students gain work experience and are given what are called 'scholarship credits ' based on the student's performance meaning that the harder you work ,the more you earn.In this way , individuals are able to gain skills thereby promising a better future for the student and making them professional.Through the EWYL program,a learner can  lower the basic cost of food and accommodation which reduces strains on the family finances.In conclusion,the EWYL program is very beneficial which makes the Edoofa program outstanding and different from other scholarship programs.

8.Yes I am clear about the registration fee protocol as explained to me by Ms Arshita yesterday
14/10/23, 2:23 pm - Austin: Good Work, Kimberley!
14/10/23, 2:23 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>

As per your understanding, what is the minimum academic requirement in A level?
18/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 695 1156: According to my understanding, the minimum pass at A level is 3 points but qualification for a particular program is then  mostly determined by the institution offering the program
18/10/23, 11:10 am - Austin: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
18/10/23, 11:10 am - Austin: Don't you feel your child can excel with much more than two A level passes?
18/10/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 695 1156: I am very confident that my child will excell I all her subjects with very good passes
18/10/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 695 1156: Noted thank you
18/10/23, 11:15 am - Austin: That's great to know!
18/10/23, 11:15 am - Austin: Even if Edoofians fail to meet the requirements, they have a positive path ahead. If a student qualifies as a deserving student for the Edoofa scholarship we believe that he/she has the calibre to meet the grades, so in case they fail to meet them, even then the eligibility will be valid, and students can write the exams again, gain minimum points and can join the intake. With the right needs and resources students will give their best to perform well.
18/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 695 1156: Okay great. It's so encouraging you have so much confidence in the student which I as a parent also do
18/10/23, 11:22 am - Austin: I am so happy to hear this!
18/10/23, 11:22 am - Austin: Are you having other questions for me please?
18/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 695 1156: Not any other at the moment thank you
18/10/23, 11:40 am - Austin: You are welcome, did you manage to connect to any of our beneficiaries or their parents to learn their experiences with the Edoofa program?
18/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 695 1156: Yes we spoke briefly with Valerie Rukobo. She indicated that her experience as an Edoofian has benefited her greatly. She also shared how the other additional costs like food can be cut down to very affordable levels
18/10/23, 11:49 am - Austin: This is well noted, Mrs Melani and I am glad that you received more insights about the opportunity through the interaction with Valerie
18/10/23, 11:49 am - Austin: Shall I explain you the modes of enrollment fee payment?
18/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 695 1156: Ohh yes thank you Mr Austin

Dear Parent,

I hope this message finds you in good health.

I would like to extend my congratulations for completing the first part of your child's registration formalities and reserving their seat at the university.

Now, I would like to discuss the remaining balance of $150 for your child's enrollment fee. 

As your counselor, I've always been empathetic and committed to offering the best career advice. Could you please inform me of your planned date for completing this payment?
21/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 695 1156: Good day to you. 
Thank you very much.
I am trying my best to beat the deadline for payment. However, may I ask if there's a waiver should one fail to meet the deadline for payment.
