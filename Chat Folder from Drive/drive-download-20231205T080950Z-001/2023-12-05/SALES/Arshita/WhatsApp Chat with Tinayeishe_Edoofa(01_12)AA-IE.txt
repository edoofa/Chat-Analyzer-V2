1)  *What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*

He taught me that the Edoofa Program is an International Education Scholarship Program that has its mission to make its students- us EDOOFIANS, Employable. And they do it by their EWYL program. As a part of this program, we Edoofians get the opportunity to learn and enhance our skills by working on real-time projects that we get from industry leaders.  The most interesting part about this program is that as a part of this program, we can self-finance our education over and above the scholarship that we have gotten based on our merit.
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - Arshita: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 
Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 


The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe.

04/12/23, 1:34 pm - Arshita: Noted
04/12/23, 1:34 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
04/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Yes ma'am l am confident
04/12/23, 1:43 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
04/12/23, 1:43 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
04/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 368 6833: Yes l did applied to others
04/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Yes l did
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - Arshita: May I know have you applied anywhere?
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Yes l have applied
04/12/23, 2:43 pm - Arshita: May I know where have you applied?
04/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Jay pawar | Parul University
04/12/23, 2:46 pm - Arshita: First of all, the degree shared by Parul Universities are not recognized on a global level, if after spending $3000 for education abroad, degrees are not considered in other countries, would that be a worthwhile investment?
04/12/23, 2:46 pm - Arshita: *The most important reason is that the University isn't ranked under the  NIRF ranking under the Ministry of Education of the Government of India!*
04/12/23, 2:46 pm - Arshita: https://www.nirfindia.org/2021/Ranking.html

This is the Official Website of ranking of Colleges and Universities by Ministry of Education under Government of India and you will be surprised to see that Parul University *is not even a part of this ranking*
04/12/23, 2:46 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
