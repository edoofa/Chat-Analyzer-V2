25/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued about your child to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on her career?
25/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Quite an eye opener. I was aware about the language and cultural diversity issues. Studying in India would impact  positively  on Tafadzwas career because of the international recognition. The R&D environment and lots of innovation are also great for her career aspirations <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
25/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 246 9142: I am not familiar with the costs
25/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 246 9142: I was hoping it not very different from our local university here...can u enlighten me on that
25/10/23, 4:36 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/10/23, 4:36 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 4:36 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
25/10/23, 5:44 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *12:00 pm CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
26/10/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 246 9142: I am not clear how it works. Please explain
26/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
26/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
26/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
26/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
26/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: *Webinars: -*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
26/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
26/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
26/10/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 246 9142: This is really an excellent program. With the advent of computers and the digital world, students from this part of the world will benefit great as most of the digital platforms are not fully developed yet. Being digitally enlighted with the EWYL program is beneficial in a two sided way...the student benefits and the fees sponsor is also reliefed due to the points earned
26/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
26/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Great program indeed
26/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
26/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
26/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
26/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
26/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most. <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 246 9142: 3
26/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

26/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Tafadzwa with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
26/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Great, stuff. I will take care of Tafadzwa remaining fees.
26/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
26/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 246 9142: I believe this will expose my child to the best education system .  The program such as EWYL will also help us financially.  She will also gain an internationally recognized qualifications.
26/10/23, 1:36 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make her career advance at even a greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
26/10/23, 1:36 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
26/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 246 9142: I think the following are required

Application letter
Testimonials from school
Visa 
Commitment by person who pays fees
26/10/23, 1:41 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
26/10/23, 1:41 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
26/10/23, 1:41 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Thanks for explaining. We usually forget about the financial aspect when applying for university places. Even locally there are application fees to be met .
26/10/23, 1:52 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
26/10/23, 1:52 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
26/10/23, 1:52 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
26/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 246 9142: The reduced enrollment fees gives the opportunity to apply at low cost as compared to most universities
26/10/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Stage 2 I think
26/10/23, 2:29 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
26/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Thank you. I have to go into a meeting at 1445
26/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
26/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process.
26/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kunal: Yes, we are done with the session
26/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Thank you
26/10/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

03/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 246 9142: The fees are reasonable. I think we can afford the stipulated fees. Provided Tafadzwa does very well in her earn while learning program I guess it will be simple for us to pay for the rest

03/11/23, 12:55 pm - Austin: This is well noted
03/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 246 9142: we will go through the letter to parents and revert back to you
03/11/23, 1:00 pm - Austin: Sure, that would be fine
03/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Good afternoon Mr Austin I'm now available
03/11/23, 3:56 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, Tafadzwa, 
How is your day progressing?
03/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Perfectly fine can't complain
03/11/23, 3:59 pm - Austin: That is great, are you having any questions for me regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
03/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Yes Sir
Can you please explain to me about the Earn While you learn program
03/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Sorry for late replies my network is low
03/11/23, 4:09 pm - Austin: Basically, the Earn While You Learn program offers Edoofians the opportunity to Earn Scholarship Credits by doing online projects on different platforms. Our students will be given online projects related to Researching, Content writing, Managing and Leading People, Community Building, Digital Marketing and many more. Based on their performance students can Earn Scholarship credits and reduce their fees. This fee will not be physical cash rather it would be reduced from the cost of education directly

All these projects are performed on online platforms and our EWYL mentors will be guiding them. The working hours are flexible and students can invest their free time.
03/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Okay
What is the proper time for applying, is it not too early to apply since I'm still in lower six and my results will come out February 2025
03/11/23, 4:32 pm - Austin: It is not early as the intake is already open.
There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!

1) Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 5&6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity. <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 4:32 pm - Austin: 2) The other major aspect is a *proper financial preparation as higher Education abroad is an important decision*
03/11/23, 4:32 pm - Austin: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

03/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Okay
What if I fail to meet the required points for law will I change the program
03/11/23, 4:46 pm - Austin: As per your understanding, what are the minimum academic requirements for the Edoofa scholarship Program?
03/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 71 544 0530: 2 A-level passes
03/11/23, 4:48 pm - Austin: That is correct, Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
03/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Yes I'm confident about achieving that
03/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 71 544 0530: During school breaks what will be foreign students doing
03/11/23, 4:53 pm - Austin: That is great to know!
03/11/23, 4:53 pm - Austin: Students usually look forward to settling down and ensuring education is not hampered. So they learn and do internships at breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.
03/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Okay thank you sir, that was all i had
03/11/23, 5:00 pm - Austin: You are welcome Tafadzwa
03/11/23, 5:00 pm - Austin: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
03/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Good evening, seems Tafadzwa is not reachable to respond to the issues u raised
03/11/23, 8:58 pm - Austin: Good Evening Mr Chisaka
Noted and I will be looking forward to hearing from Tafadzwa
03/11/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 544 0530: I will be studying Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative law And I'll be studying in India.

 The average costs for studies in Indian without a scholarship is $6000-$8000 and the annual fee paid if found eligible for the program is $2000-$3000

 In my own understanding the Earn While you learn program is a program in which students are assigned real time live online projects which they gain valuable experience while also earning scholarship credits. The money will be used to reduce a portion of their higher education fees. The students will be given online projects that are related to employability skills such as analytical skills, communication skills, creative skills,media literacy, critical thinking and a lot more. Skill training helps students to identify, train and nurture their innate talent in the desired field
03/11/23, 9:46 pm - Austin: Please address the last question as well
03/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Yes I'm clear about that sir

22/11/23, 8:34 pm - Austin: That is a genuine concern Mr Chisaka and a lot of things are happening around us each day which is the reason, it is important that you verify the programs. Being your career counsellor, I can only provide you information, and I always insist parents to walk that extra mile to research, understand and verify the program to proceed with full confidence!
22/11/23, 8:35 pm - Austin: Since we have come so far with the Edoofa program, have you researched on the program, connected or met any of our beneficiaries or their parents in Zimbabwe to learn their experiences?
22/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Yes I checked and I am happy

22/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Valerie Rukobo

22/11/23, 9:19 pm - Austin: That is great to know!
22/11/23, 9:21 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 9:21 pm - Austin: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
22/11/23, 9:22 pm - Austin: Usually, students travel in groups and our Admissions team arrange their journey in the groups
22/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 532 6491: That's great
22/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Okay Sir
22/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 532 6491: I think today we have asked what we wanted to know if we have any questions we will ask
22/11/23, 9:45 pm - Austin: This is well noted, have a good night!
27/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Fine how are you
27/11/23, 1:09 pm - Austin: Good to hear that, Tafadzwa!
I am doing well
27/11/23, 1:09 pm - Austin: Is there anything that you would like to ask  me regarding the Edoofa program as of now?
27/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 544 0530: Yes
Is it possible for one to start that Earn with you learn projects now so that by the time I go to University that money will be added to the fees
27/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 532 6491: Hi Mr Austin.we are looking forward to pay the first invoice tomorrow
27/11/23, 1:41 pm - Austin: Absolutely Tafadzwa, your Earn While You Learn Program begins within few days after your enrollment while you are in Zimbabwe itself
27/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 532 6491: Zimbabwe specilises in dutch law what about India and will she be able to practice law in Zimbabwe after University?
27/11/23, 1:41 pm - Austin: This helps you earn scholarship credits to reduce the cost of education and gain experiences
27/11/23, 1:42 pm - Austin: Zimbabwe’s Legal system consists of Common law (non-statutory or unwritten Anglo-Roman Dutch Law), Legislation Case Law (Precedent) and Customary Law. India's legal system is drawn from three primary sources: the common law, religious law, and civil ('romanist') law. So you can see the similarities as both the countries were colonized and have adopted foreign jurisdictions.
27/11/23, 1:54 pm - Austin: Have I addressed your question @263775326491 ?
27/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 532 6491: Yes sir it's clear
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - Austin: Are you having other questions for me?

27/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Thanks. Please may you confirm how much should be deposited into Mr Jerera account to cater for transfer charges if we are to pay USD 200
27/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Kindly confirm whether Tafadzwa DOB has been corrected
27/11/23, 2:31 pm - Austin: It would be $225
27/11/23, 2:31 pm - Austin: You will be receiving the updated Acceptance Letter today
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 246 9142: After depositing the USD 225 into Mr Jerera account, how do we communicate proof of payment and to whom
27/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 532 6491: If a child misbehaves, get out of the  line of your rules and regulations how do you handle the situations
27/11/23, 2:46 pm - Austin: You can send payment proof on the platform which will be verified by our Accounts Team
27/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 246 9142: Noted, thank you
27/11/23, 2:49 pm - Austin: We have our Department of Student Welfare at our campuses who will be in touch with students on a regular basis. Moreover, our EWYL team and mentors will be connected to Edoofians to guide them at every stage and assist with the projects. Therefore, any misbehaviour will be addressed by our team, counselling the students and guiding them in the right path. Further misbehaviour would invite the action as per the guidelines of the Universities.
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - Austin: We have a team closely monitoring and guiding Edoofians due to which our students stay career centred and focused on their goals
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
