21/11/23, 12:02 pm - Tushti: Nercia, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
21/11/23, 12:03 pm - Tushti: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

22/11/23, 10:26 am - +263 78 377 2781: Thank you Ms Tushti for this information. I'm beginning to understand India with a high profile perspective.
22/11/23, 10:40 am - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
22/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 377 2781: No we are not familiar
22/11/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
22/11/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: In simple words Nercia, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 377 2781: Okay thank you Ms Tushti, I appreciate the Edoofa program.
22/11/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 377 2781: Thank you. I'm following.
22/11/23, 11:33 am - Tushti: Now, let me brief you about the EWYL Program
22/11/23, 11:33 am - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
22/11/23, 11:33 am - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/11/23, 11:33 am - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/11/23, 11:34 am - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
22/11/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 858 8205: It really is , thank you for shading more light
22/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 858 8205: I'm sure if she get a chance with Edoofa , she will also be 1 among those who have and are benefiting from theEWYL program
22/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 71 854 3162: Hi it's Nercia here.My phone' s connection has dropped so I'm using my aunt's.

I'm glad to hear about the earn while you learn program.I will be happy to engage in such activities.
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Tushti: Noted
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
22/11/23, 12:06 pm - Tushti: Nercia, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 377 2781: Okay, I'm following
22/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 377 2781: Will Edoofa help me with advice for the university to apply to
22/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 377 2781: It will cost from 1500-2250
22/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 78 377 2781: USD
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - Tushti: Exactly Nercia, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/11/23, 12:18 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
22/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 377 2781: Yes I agree Edoofa has revolutionized the admission process
22/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 377 2781: Wow that's really great
22/11/23, 12:23 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 377 2781: Okay thank you
22/11/23, 12:24 pm - Tushti: Nercia, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
22/11/23, 12:24 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
22/11/23, 12:24 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
22/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 377 2781: Yes I do understand
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: Alright Nercia, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
22/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 377 2781: Okay
22/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 377 2781: I did not understand here, after paying $350, I will also pay $500-1000 again?
22/11/23, 12:35 pm - Tushti: Yes, dear, that would be your tuition fee for the University, it would not be paid to Edoofa
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 377 2781: Okay so I pay $350 to Edoofa to proceed to step 2 then to get admitted I will also pay $500-1000. so overally what will be the amount I pay  annually in total
22/11/23, 12:39 pm - Tushti: Well, as alsready mentioned, your annual fee would around $2000
22/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 377 2781: Is this tuition fee going to be paid annually
22/11/23, 12:41 pm - Tushti: Yes
22/11/23, 12:42 pm - Tushti: This was discussed here
22/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 858 8205: Herr network dropped down again , so when is that money needed for her to proceed to step 2
22/11/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: That would be from seven days of acceptance!
22/11/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
22/11/23, 12:57 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
22/11/23, 12:58 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

TOPIC :What is is life in Rwanda like, 16 years after the genocide?

In April 1994,a gloomy dark cloud suspended itself upon Rwanda. In the aftermath of the attack on President Habynama's plane, extremist HUTUS began a massive attack against Tutsi in Rwanda. Rwandans were brutally slaughtered by fellow citizens in a state-led genocide targeting the Tutsi ethnic group.

Many women suffered the consequences of rape and sexual violence. Thousands of children were orphaned and had to fend for themselves. Countless survivors developed long-term psychological problems.

It is shocking and pleasantly amazing today, how Rwanda has rebuilt from ashes of horrific tragedy and destruction. This is evidenced by its economic, social and political development.

Rwanda is setting itself apart from other developing nations by intelligently, efficiently and transparently making the most of other nations' investments. Creating the building blocks of success in agriculture, social services, entrepreneurship and basic infrastructure. Rwanda has also improved it's health care facilities.

Rwanda has come farther in the past 16 years than many nations would have. All of this development is important to recognize because it has been the government's express policy to deliver basic services and economic growth to its people in order to migrate genocide ideology. Traveling in the country used to be a bumpy ride, some roads were not even passable. Currently , the road infrastructure is impressive and continues to expand. Today, citizens have access to electricity and running water. Also, in lake kivu, which borders Rwanda to the west, an American company has been constructed,which is one of the world's largest methane extractors.

Hotels are being built everywhere. There is a rise in tourism demand. Wireless broadband has been built out across the country. More restaurants are opening, as are universities, technical schools and preschools. Education is now affordable and accessible. The second national language has shifted from french to English and the country has joined the British commonwealth.

Even though Rwanda has made significant progress in rebuilding and developing since 1994 genocide, the small and landlocked country of nearly 14 million people faces many challenges today including inflation and high unemployment rates.
There are many people who wonder will continue to develop in stability or meet some sort of chaos. To meet its destiny, Rwanda will need the grand hotels, vocational schools, improved farm productivity, light manufacturing jobs, better health care and many more. This nation has shown it can rise from the aftermath of unspeakable violence, and is determined to keep that momentum going. If the past 16 years are any indication, Rwanda is capable of achieving the best.

MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY.

Growing up in a small and inferior neighborhood, surviving from the work of stern hands of a peasant farmer define me. Standing against all odds is my strength.
I'm Nercia Munyanyiwa, a female aged 19. I grew up in Rukara village, Mashonaland west province Zimbabwe.

I'm a very diligent and hard working young lady with a vivid desire for success. I'm a person 
who never gives up. I like to prove the norm commonly said in my society '' girls can't achieve this '' wrong.

I'm a flexible person, I can adapt quickly to change, be it change in the environment, lifestyle or anything. I have the ability to work under minimal supervision. I am a self-motivated person, goal driven and focused.I chase my dreams with all the potential I have until I finally realize them. 

I'm also a person who enjoy helping and reaching out to others. I'm a blood donor since 2022.I do social work in my community for example, picking up litter and its disposal. Some of my hobbies are reading, traveling and cooking. 

I grew up in a family of four children, I being the third one. I grew up under the protection of a widow. My father demised when I was three years old. In a country like mine where inflation is always present, we had to be strong as a family. We fought through all perils and triumphed in the end. 

Conclusively, all I can say is I have a great personality, amazing sense of humor and a tremendous will for success.

I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
