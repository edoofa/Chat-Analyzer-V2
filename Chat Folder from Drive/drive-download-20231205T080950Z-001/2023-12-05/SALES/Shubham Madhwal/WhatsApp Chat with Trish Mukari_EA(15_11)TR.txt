17/11/23, 1:37 pm - Tushti: Edoofa operates from India, @263774076121
17/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 840 4323: My name is Trish Mukari , A girl born in 2005 October 09. I am the first born in a family of two . I have a little brother who's still doing his primary Education. He is currently in Grade 5 .  We are a single parent family, being raised and groom by my mother. My hobby is volleyball. I sometimes play for the school team . I am doing my A level at Seke 1 High school in Chitungwiza , Zimbabwe. Am a lower six student doing Horticulture , Business Enterprise and Skills and Geography as my combination. The career l would like to study is mining geology and anything else that might have anything to do with Geography or Horticulture since these two subjects have always been my favorite . I just want to do anything that l have passion with. 

My mother is currently working as a hospital clerk . She is 41 years old and she is the one who has been financially supporting me especially on Education . She has been playing a big role and l appreciate everything she does for us , my little brother and l. 

At this moment l have no idea who will pay for my higher education abroad but am sure God has a plan for me.My school fees at Seke 1 High is $75 US dollars

17/11/23, 3:09 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your parents to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are your parents facing such a situation?
17/11/23, 4:52 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 840 4323: Yaa Its difficult for a single parent to manage to raise two children on her own and provide all the basic needs for her two kids. Of course she faces some challenges but still she works hard and try by all means to make things better for us as her kids. All thanks to her  , that am here . If she was someone else she would have left us to suffer but am grateful for her motherly love
17/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 840 4323: Thank you  for your time . Its just that the network here is down so there's slow connection.

18/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 407 6121: Ok thank you on behalf of Trish.
18/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 840 4323: Thank you for the session Ms. Tushti and others
21/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 840 4323: Good morning
21/11/23, 10:42 am - Tushti: I was expecting a response here
21/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 840 4323: No . I asked someone and she told me that school fees differs with the location of the school.
21/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 840 4323: She was once in India for the past 3 years
21/11/23, 10:50 am - Tushti: I see
21/11/23, 10:50 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
21/11/23, 10:51 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/11/23, 10:51 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/11/23, 10:51 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 10:51 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/11/23, 10:52 am - Tushti: In simple words Trish, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 407 6121: No we are not
21/11/23, 12:16 pm - Tushti: I believe you have now understood?
21/11/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 840 4323: Ok
21/11/23, 12:19 pm - Tushti: Do you find this affordable for the family??
21/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 407 6121: Yes it is affordable
21/11/23, 12:42 pm - Tushti: So, now, shall I brief you about the EWYL Program?
21/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 840 4323: Yes
21/11/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
21/11/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/11/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/11/23, 1:10 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
21/11/23, 1:26 pm - Tushti: Are we connected, Trish?
21/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 840 4323: Yes we are its just that there's some Network challenges
21/11/23, 2:25 pm - Tushti: Alright
21/11/23, 2:26 pm - Tushti: Now since we are reaching the end of my working hours and I want to end your Counselling session today itself so that you may proceed to the interview stage next, kindly be prompt with your responses
21/11/23, 2:26 pm - Tushti: I hope you have now understood the Program and how it is beneficial?
21/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 840 4323: Yes l have understood
21/11/23, 2:43 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
21/11/23, 2:43 pm - Tushti: Trish, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 840 4323: Its about $1500 to $2500
21/11/23, 3:18 pm - Tushti: Exactly Trish, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/11/23, 3:18 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
21/11/23, 3:18 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
21/11/23, 3:18 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 840 4323: I think so
21/11/23, 3:26 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
21/11/23, 3:26 pm - Tushti: Trish, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
21/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 840 4323: Ok
21/11/23, 3:26 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
21/11/23, 3:26 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
21/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 840 4323: Yaah l can understand
21/11/23, 3:35 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
21/11/23, 3:35 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:35 pm - Tushti: Alright Trish, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
21/11/23, 3:35 pm - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
21/11/23, 3:35 pm - Tushti: August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.
21/11/23, 3:35 pm - Tushti: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
21/11/23, 3:35 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
21/11/23, 3:35 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
21/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 840 4323: So the universities that one can be enrolled into are given after this whole process ?
21/11/23, 3:51 pm - Tushti: Yes
21/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 840 4323: Ok
21/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 840 4323: That was the only question l had not knowing if my mother has some questions
21/11/23, 3:53 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/11/23, 3:53 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
21/11/23, 3:54 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

In case you do not follow these terms then *Trish's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
23/11/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 840 4323: Ok

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *29th or 30th of November 2023* for $200 and the *29th or 30th of December 2023* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *29th or 30th of November 2023*

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

04/12/23, 4:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
04/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 407 6121: As for me am always buzy at work. Am sorry for the inconvenience
