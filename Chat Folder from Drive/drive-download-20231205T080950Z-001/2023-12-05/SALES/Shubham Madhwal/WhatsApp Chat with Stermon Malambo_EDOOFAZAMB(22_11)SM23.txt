*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Luyanda?*
23/11/23, 11:17 am - +260 97 6182543: 1) My motivation to apply for Adoofa scholarship program is due to the fact that all  adoofians are pursuing their careers with a wide range of opportunities offered by the scholarship program.Not only that the program make it possible for African students as in my case to go and study my dream career offered by best schools in India despite having financial challenges.I was also motivated to apply for this program because of Love, care and support the adoofian's mentor they offer to the students.This proves enough the ground of Guardianship.
23/11/23, 11:37 am - +260 97 6182543: Our discussion was quite interesting, firstly I understood that the program mainly help the deserving students (such as upper six students, former A level students even lower six).Apart from that I came to know that the program is not 100% sponsorship. However,there is also a perspective of earn while you learn which enables students to self finance their education and career.The program unlocks the great potential in various scholars with a view to  imparting skills, knowledge and confidence in students for their preparations to participate in the global arena
23/11/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail

23/11/23, 12:14 pm - +260 97 6182543: Yes
23/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*.

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
23/11/23, 5:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
23/11/23, 10:34 pm - +260 96 3408171: Well 
As the father for Stermon Malambo, let say just a little on how much I know Edoofa while already appreciating the programs such as the Scholarship on offer and the services you as an Institution provide to learners, 
In a nutshell let me just say I say yes for the programs and services you are about to offer my son.
Go ahead and help him by unlocking set backs in order for him to attain greatness for programs, services and any other related issues related to scholarship alongside it.
For me I agree,
Stermon Hang'ombe

01/12/23, 12:38 am - +260 97 6182543: As you already know my name,I was born on 4th June,2004 and bred in Choma district,the provincial capital of southern province in Zambia.As the first born son of Mr and Mrs Malambo,who raised me morally upright and full of integrity.I have six brothers and no sister,the first four after me, are all in school while the other two are young and still being nurtured at home.


I started school in 2012 and completed       my senior level( grade 12) this year in November.Following my school academic history and lifestyle, ever since I started my junior secondary course in 2019,I developed a good acumen in scientific subjects basically Physics, Chemistry and Biology. From there on I participated in several academic activities such as QUIZ, DEBATE, READING,a little bit of CHESS and many others. I even joined clubs such as SOSTAZ,BUSTAZ,RATAZ,NASAZ, and most important JETS( Junior Engineers Technicians and Scientists) in which I came the best in senior quiz and physics Olympiads category in the entire district this year.


I would like to study medical sciences because I believe that my intellectual ability and constant passion for learning will not only bring person development but also it will find community growth.


Currently both my father (Mr Malambo) and mother (Mrs Malambo) are self employed.My father works as a welder while my mother as a sales woman(marketeer) she sells greens. They both do this with a view to catering our needs for survival.


My father completed his senior secondary education ( grade 12) and studied short courses of ICT and psychosocial counselling.


Ever since I started schooling my parents have been supporting me with school basic necessities from grade one(1) until grade twelve (12). Fortunately, when the new government came into power in 2021 the burden was reduced when it introduced the Free education policy.


As for my financial support abroad,for now I have no one to help me reach the stars(🌟). Nevertheless,I am hoping to get excellent results and apply for sponsorship from the government or any other well wisher organization that maybe interested in my pursuits and ambitions.


My former school is Swan secondary, located in Choma district of southern province.The school is not far from Njase Girls secondary (the institution you mentioned earlier).When I started learning at this school I paid 600 Zambia kwacha, fortunately,the fees were reduced to 200 Zambian kwacha by the former government. Finally came the new government in 2021 and established the Free education policy which abolished paying any fees at school from grade one (1) to twelve (12).

As for that Mr Shubham sir,I believe that,as an individual we are all born with a set of certain traits,talents, creativity and imaginations but all these together, requires proper guidelines and principles for them to be realized in fullest.These principles and guidelines can be obtained in learning institution such as colleges and Universities.

That's a brief I can say about myself.
01/12/23, 9:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Stermon, How are you?
01/12/23, 10:51 am - +260 97 6182543: Good morning sir
01/12/23, 10:51 am - +260 97 6182543: I sent something about myself
01/12/23, 11:26 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
01/12/23, 11:26 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
01/12/23, 11:39 am - +260 97 6182543: Yes sir, very available
01/12/23, 11:44 am - +260 97 6182543: You can start sir.
01/12/23, 12:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, what all activities did you participate in your school for your holistic growth?
01/12/23, 1:29 pm - +260 97 6182543: During my school period at Swan secondary school,I engaged my self in various activities such as ENGLISH DEBATE AND PUBLIC SPEAKING, ENGLISH AND SCIENCE (chemistry, physics and biology) QUIZ, CIVIC EDUCATION AND GEOGRAPHY PAPER PRESENTATION, BUSINESS STUDIES PRESENTATION AT JUNIOR LEVEL.In other school activities I was in the school basketball 🏀 team in which we competed with schools such Choma secondary and so on. To be Frank,the school has played a major role in my holistic growth in a such way that I was able to apply the skills and knowledge I acquired in every field of competition encountered. Some of the major things the school had done to bring about my holistic growth, was to expose me to various events and exhibition. For instance this year I was accorded an opportunity to deliver a vote of thanks during the flagging off of desks by the ministry of education at St Mawagalu college(Choma)

Apart from that, I was assigned to present a school Art Department gallery during the  Civil Servants Day exhibition this year.

Due to this exposure I realized that it is possible to fullfil my dreams despite financial status.

Studying has been an adventure since I started school,I discovered new things every day.The school provided the medium studying environment. Despite being not accorded full conducive studying environment I managed to handle the  obstacles by changing my studying routine. <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 2:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e. the picture of your results for Grade 10-Level and results for Grade-12.
01/12/23, 3:03 pm - +260 97 6182543: Okay

01/12/23, 3:30 pm - +260 97 6182543: Sir here are my grade-12 results
01/12/23, 3:31 pm - +260 97 6182543: <Media omitted>

02/12/23, 9:41 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
02/12/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 6182543: I am doing well Sir,thank you for that warm greeting.
02/12/23, 9:50 am - +260 97 6182543: Indeed you can start the discussion.
02/12/23, 10:15 am - +260 97 6182543: I hope you have noticed, I sent the grade 12 results for last term.
02/12/23, 11:35 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes Please I have!
02/12/23, 11:37 am - Shubham Madhwal: So Stermon, I can see that you have opted for Arts subjects in Grade-12 where as we you wish to purse Medical Sciences for higher education, Can you eplain/
02/12/23, 11:52 am - +260 97 6182543: Actually Art and Design was my optional Subject,I always wanted to know more about history of art. But that was not my desire as a career, as I mentioned earlier I enjoy discovering new things every day.If you noticed SCIENCE SCORE(98%) was handwritten at the bottom, this was done because the results for science were missing when my former class teacher was compiling the results. Fortunately they found the results and write them at the bottom. However,that score in science is very authentic I can assure you that. Giving me a reason to pursue medical sciences.
02/12/23, 12:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted, I skipped that,
So Why have you not opted for Pure sceinecs?
02/12/23, 12:20 pm - +260 97 6182543: At my former school, pure sciences were not provided. But since grade 10 I have been studying pure sciences (especially physics) and Cambridge biology syllabus on my on.    I even had an opportunity to participate in Junior Engineers and Scientists (JETS) this year, where I competed in pure physics Olympiads and senior quiz and scooped the first position in both categories.

04/12/23, 9:59 am - +260 97 6182543: Indeed Sir! Very much available.
04/12/23, 10:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: So how was your weekend?
04/12/23, 10:35 am - +260 97 6182543: The weekend was amazing, I had a nice time as I was going through the links you shared.
04/12/23, 10:40 am - +260 97 6182543: On Saturday I slept around 02.23 Hrs, the videos  were inspiring and motivating especially on Instagram such that my brain was just thinking about the Edoofa scholarship program until now 😄. <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 11:27 am - Shubham Madhwal: As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
04/12/23, 11:38 am - +260 97 6182543: Generally I have already researched the requirements for Medine. But not specifically in India.
04/12/23, 12:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
04/12/23, 12:12 pm - +260 97 6182543: So like in my case where I only have *science* and *biology* I don't qualify or?
04/12/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 6182543: Is this means I am not *eligible*?
04/12/23, 1:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as the majority of the time, Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
04/12/23, 1:37 pm - +260 97 6182543: Okay, Sir now I need your help, which one would you prefer that I should pursue in accordance to how you have seen my partial qualifications?
04/12/23, 2:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please I would like to ask you to first individually  research about these courses and then I would be able to assist you better
04/12/23, 2:08 pm - +260 97 6182543: Okay I will do that today right away, Any other Questions Sir.
04/12/23, 4:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
