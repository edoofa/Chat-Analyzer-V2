01/12/23, 12:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
01/12/23, 12:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/12/23, 12:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/12/23, 1:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
01/12/23, 1:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Yes I understand that
01/12/23, 1:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
01/12/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/12/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

02/12/23, 9:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding about the videos. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
02/12/23, 9:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
02/12/23, 9:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
02/12/23, 9:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
02/12/23, 9:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
02/12/23, 9:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
02/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 530 2324: Yes I managed to view all

04/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 530 2324: 2 What is psychology and how is it a since ?.What purpose does reasrch in psychology

Psychology is the study of human mind such as behavior, feelings or is about mental behavioral characteristics. 
Psychology is a since since it uses scientific methods to collect data, they need evidence or based strategies that can solve problems and improves lives.
A research in psychology can be used to investigate the characteristics behaviors or opinions of a group of people. Research data can be used to ask or interview others using the same data and also research can be used to create evidence and strategies that can used to solve problems and improve lives. Lastly to gather or gain knowledge in the field..


3  what do you understand by I'd, ego and superego?.Please explain giving examples 

I'd is the primitive and instinctive component of personality, I'd is a part of the urges and impulses. For example if the need or want is not met ,the person will experiences anxiety, anger or evern tension. Example two a baby can cry due to hungry until he or she get food.

Ego is the psychological component of the personality that is represented by our conscious decision-marking process or we can say ego is the organized, realistic agent that mediates between the instinctual desires of the I'd and the critical superego..
For example  when someone is very and sees food ready on the table but the persons ego would tell him that it is not good to take the food without permission from the one who cookies or owner. 

Superego is the social component of our personality and conscience. 
For example when someone do something to feel good about his behavior .lf a woman feels an urge to steal office supplies from work and her superego counteract this urge 
buy focusing on the fact that such behaviors are wrong. 

4 Why do you think there is stigma about mental health or talking about mental health?.how do you think will be able to remove that stigma and make it more acceptable to society 

I think there is stigma about mental health because l see lack of understanding of mental illness and also because some people have negative attitudes or beliefs towards mental health. 
They may be afraid that being open about them will hurt their reputation, relationships and even there jobs .
To remove that stigma and make it more acceptable to society ,first for example people should associate with mental illness person,take some understandings .Talk openly about mental health, choose or use your words carefully. Share trusted sources of information you rely on ,speak up if you hear ,see or read so that people know it's TRUE.

5 There has been an ongoing debate on whether early or late experiences are more important in determining aspects of late life.What is your opinion?Do early experiences rule us for life?.justify your answer 

To a great extent most people agree that early experiences will have the greatest impact upon the direction of someone's life since it shapes the maturity of individual, influencing subsequent accommodation to actual environments ,through regulating the development of personality features, it disrupt ear brain development and compromise functioning of the nervous and immune system. This is why first five years of a baby is very important to shape his life.

To a lesser extent late experiences stage can not affect someone since he or she is old enough to make decisions and make some changes to over come environmental influences, friends, schools and culture and we can learn rules to protect our self
04/12/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 530 2324: Good morning to you all .l hope you are doing great

04/12/23, 12:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe, I hope you had a great weekend. 

Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. So, are you ready for today's session?
04/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay thank you.yes we can  start
04/12/23, 12:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263785302324, Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (8-Dec-2023).
04/12/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/DpTXIwoUfFrEazu3mlZN5x
04/12/23, 12:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Kasu kudakwashe, and my EWYL group name is Kudakwashe EWYL23E0968. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey.

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
04/12/23, 12:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
04/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 284 5146: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay that fine
04/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay understand that
04/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay I will do that
04/12/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Psychology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 284 5146: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay that's fine .

Yes it's BA*( *PSYCHOLOGY** ) .yes I'm planning to arrive in India during August 2024
04/12/23, 1:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/12/23, 1:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/12/23, 1:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/12/23, 1:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Yes l agree and understand that
04/12/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good to know @263785302324 Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/12/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/12/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay I understand
04/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay we understand that
04/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Yes the counselor explained about it
04/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Yeah we are on the same page
04/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
04/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
04/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Yes l take note of that
04/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
04/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
04/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay I understand all.we can discuss the matter and see if we can pay once or monthly
04/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along @263785302324. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
04/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
04/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
04/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay that's fine
04/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay
04/12/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay me I don't have any question but I don't know if mom have any question
04/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 284 5146: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I will be happy to assist you here @263772845146. Let me share that we could not share the specific costs with you at the moment, once we complete our discussion today we will move ahead with Kudakwashe's application at multiple universities. When you will receive your offer letter then you will be able to know your actual cost of education however, we have already shared a specific range with you for your financial preparation.
04/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding your second query, Yes it's possible for the students to pay their complete tuition fees with the help of Earn While Your Learn Program, For this, the students need to be serious for their journey and have to attend their session regularly. May I know if you have any other concern?
04/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 530 2324: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 530 2324: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Ananya_ and she has scheduled my session for 8.30amto 930am*(mention the date)

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

04/12/23, 3:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263785302324, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
04/12/23, 3:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
04/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay l review all
04/12/23, 3:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
04/12/23, 3:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
04/12/23, 3:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
04/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay l understand  all
04/12/23, 3:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
04/12/23, 3:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
04/12/23, 3:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay .yes it explain
04/12/23, 3:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
04/12/23, 3:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay I understand all
04/12/23, 3:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
04/12/23, 3:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
04/12/23, 3:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 530 2324: Okay l get it ,all clear
04/12/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 530 2324: For me  it's clear and l don't  know for my mom
04/12/23, 3:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let's wait for her response in that case.
