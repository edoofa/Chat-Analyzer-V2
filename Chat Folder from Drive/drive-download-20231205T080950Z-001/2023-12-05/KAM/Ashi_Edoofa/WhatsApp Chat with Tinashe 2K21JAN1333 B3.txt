02/08/23, 9:15 pm - +263 71 773 3930: Very well noted I definitely will
02/08/23, 9:24 pm - +263 71 773 3930: @918178723499 what should the affidavit from my parents contain?
03/08/23, 7:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: @263717733930, the affidavit from the parents is the same document as the letter of sponsorship. The format for the letter was shared with you earlier during our conversation. 

Your parents/guardian can act as the sponsor for the visa application process and issue the letter of sponsorship. In the letter, he/she would have to clearly mention his/her relationship with you as your guardian. Additionally, the bank statement provided for the visa application should be that of your guardian/parents, as they will be financially supporting your education.

To ensure a smooth and successful visa application, it is crucial to provide all necessary documentation, including a well-written sponsorship letter with all relevant details.
03/08/23, 7:28 am - +263 71 773 3930: Good morning….Well for the sponsorship letter we had to use my uncle’s details because my parents dont have a bank account with statements of $10 000.will adding my uncle as my sponsor be a problem
03/08/23, 7:38 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Not @263717733930, your guardian can also act as your sponsor for the visa process and hence you can ask him to draft a letter of sponsorship for you and share his bank statement for the application procedures.
03/08/23, 7:39 am - +263 71 773 3930: Very well noted
03/08/23, 10:52 am - +27 81 575 2983: This message was deleted

I hope you are doing well, I understand, @263717733930, and I appreciate you sharing this information with me. I would like to provide you with a recent update that could be beneficial for your visa application. For some students, the embassy has begun issuing visas without the requirement of attested documents. Therefore, if you wish, you can try processing your visa application without getting the documents attested.

However, please keep in mind that individual circumstances may vary, and if the embassy asks for the attested documents, in that case, you would have to get them attested and then proceed further. I hope you have taken note of this update?

01/09/23, 3:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Absolutely wonderful, Tinashe. I want to assure you that your efforts and communication have been duly noted and will be appropriately updated in our records. I'll also relay this information to the university officials, ensuring that everything is aligned for your smooth transition.
01/09/23, 3:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As we move forward, rest assured that we are here to support you every step of the way. Keep an eye out for the arrival guidelines we'll be sharing within this week. Meanwhile, focus on getting your bags packed and making sure you're all set for your upcoming journey.
01/09/23, 3:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Should you have any queries, need further clarifications, or simply want to share updates, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your journey is important to us, and we're committed to making it a seamless and positive experience.
01/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 773 3930: Thank you so much
05/09/23, 5:54 am - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings,

I have a crucial update to share with all of you. As you may be aware, whenever one makes an International money transfer, there is an amount charged by the bank which is usually around 18%. Due to exchange in fluctuation, Ms. Eugene has received the less amount needed for your resrvation. 

In order to cover the difference, a payment of $35 is now required to successfully book your accommodation. For more details and instructions regarding this payment, please reach out to Ms. Eugene directly. She will provide you with all the necessary information.
05/09/23, 6:26 am - +263 71 773 3930: Good morning let me talk to miss eugene
05/09/23, 6:28 am - +263 71 773 3930: I would prefer to give this money to her in person because now sending this $35 means more charges for us here and as it we have literally no money left to spare.
05/09/23, 9:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @263717733930 I can understand your concern but the amount is needed for your accommodation in India, we want you to have a easy and smooth arrival here. I am glad that you have contacted Ms. Eugene she will help you in the best possible way.
05/09/23, 10:00 am - +263 71 773 3930: Thank you
06/09/23, 4:00 am - +263 71 773 3930: Greetings just checking if all is in order…ill be taking my flight this afternoon
06/09/23, 5:23 am - +263 71 773 3930: At 12:35
06/09/23, 8:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Tinashe,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 7th of Sep at 08:20 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
06/09/23, 8:07 am - +263 71 773 3930: Noted
06/09/23, 8:07 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
06/09/23, 8:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Tinashe 2K21JAN1333-*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. Make sure to keep $30 to $40 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
06/09/23, 8:08 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

Furthermore, we are sharing the undertaking form once again. If you have already filled it out, please share the scanned copy with us. Remember to bring the physical form with you to India and submit it when you meet the Edoofa Officials. In case you have not yet filled out the form, please ensure to do so today.
