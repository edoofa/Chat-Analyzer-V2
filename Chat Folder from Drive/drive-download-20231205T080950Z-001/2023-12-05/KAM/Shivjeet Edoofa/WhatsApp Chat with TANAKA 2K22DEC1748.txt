I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
18/10/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected @263773415211
18/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Iam now connected. Net work problem
18/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
19/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 341 5211: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Offer letter is a letter from  institutes of higher education with clearly laid down requirements for a particular program.   You may shade light on this
19/10/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are well and blessed. I was unable to connect with you further, as it was not my available hours by the time you reached out.

I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
19/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Yes Iam ready to proceed
19/10/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Oooh Yes we on the same page
19/10/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
19/10/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
19/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 341 5211: More than ready for this
19/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
19/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
19/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 341 5211: I have gone through  the benefits
19/10/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Noted
19/10/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Resonated if stands like that
19/10/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Understood
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Noted with thanks
19/10/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
19/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Provide more information
19/10/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
19/10/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
19/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 341 5211: May you elaborate on this
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly.
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: When a student reaches the fourth step of their application process, their A-Level results might not be available yet. In this case, their application is reviewed based on their past academic records, a statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. They are granted provisional admission and a minimum 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To keep this scholarship and pursue their Bachelor's degree, students need to get at least two passes, which are basically two E grades. But sometimes, students may perform poorly in their A-Levels, and in such cases, they may not qualify for the 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, if a student secures their scholarship seat with the university through the Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage won't be reduced from the initial 50% and will stay the same. This means that the student can continue with their scholarship even if they didn't perform well in high school.
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If a student later achieves better results, the university will re-evaluate their application, and their scholarship amount may be adjusted accordingly.
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This entire process shows how the Endowment Plan can be advantageous for students. It gives them an edge over others who go through the admission process without Edoofa's assistance, as it provides a safety net for their scholarship, even if their initial academic performance is not outstanding.

In essence, the Endowment Plan offers a way for students to secure and maintain their scholarships, even if their initial academic performance is not up to the mark.
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know when you are clear.
19/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 341 5211: I have gone through  all. Noted
19/10/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected? @263773415211
20/10/23, 6:20 am - +263 77 341 5211: Noted
20/10/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I was not able to respond to your messages by the time you have shared, as it was past my available hours. So, shall we connect this evening at 7:30 PM to further proceed with the session?
20/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Ummm I won't be  connected.  I will be  holding prayer sessions  from  7pm to 11pm
20/10/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about your schedule. Your commitment to your prayer sessions is important, and I respect that. Let's find another suitable time to continue our discussion. Shall we proceed with the session tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM?
20/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Okay thanks.  That schedule can do
25/10/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you the other day as it was the weekend and followed by a national holiday in India called Dussehra. Here is a little insight about it:
25/10/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Dussehra, also known as Vijayadashami, is a big Hindu festival in India that's all about celebrating good beating evil. It's based on a famous ancient story where a good prince named Rama defeated a bad demon king named Ravana. To show this victory, people make big statues of Ravana and then set them on fire. This festival is like a big, colorful party with parades, traditional dances, and family gatherings. It's a special time in India when people come together to have fun and remember this ancient story of good winning over evil.
25/10/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that being said, I am now available to take on your session. Please note that I will also be available in the Evening at 7:30 PM as well. So, if you are currenly available now, shall we proceed with the session?
25/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Let's try tomorrow  earlier than 7:30pm, preferably 3:00pm if possible
25/10/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: very well, we shall connect at the said timeframe. Have a great day ahead.
25/10/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 341 5211: You are welcome
26/10/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. 

May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
27/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Lets connect at the said time frame
27/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 341 5211: That is  1500hrs
27/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and TANAKA!

Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, as we can do that too. Thank you for your understanding, and please do enjoy your weekend.
02/11/23, 11:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and TANAKA!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after August 2023. Almost all of the student's parents have already completed their admission process for the 2024 intake, which puts us behind schedule by 2 Months now.


I would like to inform you that there are certain opportunities awaiting your admission process that will be of great help to your finances. This opportunity has been greatly appreciated by your fellow peers, and I would not like you to miss out on it as well. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.
02/11/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 341 5211: Oooh no . Thecommunicationhad been noticed and  I had suggested 3pm as connection time.
02/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 341 5211: How I am ready  to connect  on behalf of TANAKA
02/11/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
02/11/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 341 5211: We last had our session on the Benefits of Endowment program-2024 students 
These include 
1 Gain first access to scholarship 
2 Lock in the post scholarship fee structure 
3 Availing of Endowment grant of $150
4 Payment of fee into 2 parts over a30- 45day peri
02/11/23, 12:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
02/11/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Noted
02/11/23, 12:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
02/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Let's proceed
02/11/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Yaa it's  clear and understood
02/11/23, 12:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
02/11/23, 12:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
02/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Yaa Iam clear on this.
02/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 341 5211: My question is on when  I chose Diploma in Civil engineering  I had consultations with some  Edoofa  members duri application.
02/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 341 5211: I was told that after  completing Diploma  I can continue with Bachelor's degree
02/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes indeed you can do that and please let me confirm that the course that you have chosen is Diploma (Civil Engineering) correct?
02/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Yes
02/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Approximately  how many years does it take to complete a diploma  program
02/11/23, 1:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your course that is Diploma (Civil Engineering) it will be of 3 years, dear.
02/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Thank you so much
02/11/23, 1:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.

02/11/23, 1:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 341 5211: No queries  for now
02/11/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Tanaka's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Tanaka is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
02/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 341 5211: Yes looking forward to it
02/11/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Tanaka application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
02/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 341 5211: You are welcome.  Thanks
02/11/23, 2:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
