All of our sessions will be held in the same time span, and hence, we kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots.

21/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Good Afternoon .Sorry for late replies
21/11/23, 12:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries about the timing; we understand everyone has their commitments. We're just thrilled to have you on board with us. Now, Mickelly, could you please provide me with insight into this message, dear?
21/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 337 9287: My name is Mickelly Mpukuta .l am very passionate about Legislative law as l have seen loved ones being oppressed because of huge  economic gaps .l intend to make my community a better place  for everyone since l come from an ecomically challenged background .That is where my passion rooted.

We are five in my family and l am the first daughter.l come from the outskirts of Harare in Riverside where there is temporary housing and it is a rural setting with no electricity or tapped water.My father is a general nurse .My mother is currently unemployed and she gets seasonal part time projects to work on .Her salary is not consistent, so the seven of us solely depend on my father's income .

The only people involved in shaping my educational plans and aspirations are my parents who also have four of my siblings and my grandparents depending on them .Therefore without a reasonable amount of assistance , getting well educated is unfeasible for me .
21/11/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this! Mickelly, your dedication to making a difference through legislative law despite facing economic challenges speaks volumes about your strength and determination. Your passion to create a better environment for your community is truly inspiring.

Your family's situation, residing in an area without basic amenities like electricity or tapped water, highlights the hurdles you've faced. Your father's profession as a nurse, despite being commendable, comes with its own set of financial challenges, especially with your mother's employment being inconsistent. It's evident that your family faces financial strain, making it challenging to afford higher education without external support.

Your commitment to your aspirations despite these challenges is admirable. Your parents' role in supporting your education while managing a household with multiple dependents showcases their dedication and the sacrifices they've made to provide for the family.
21/11/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here at Edoofa, we acknowledge the importance of education and the transformative power it holds. We're committed to supporting students like you who strive for a better future despite facing obstacles.
21/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you very much
21/11/23, 12:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, dear. Now, may I know your parents' names and the number they would be using in this group to connect with us?
21/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 337 9287: My mother 's name is Christina Dhliwayo and her number is +263 771 499 307.
21/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 337 9287: My father 's name is Leveke Seremanj and his number is +263 773 160 534
21/11/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for this confirmation! Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 337 9287: It is well noted.
21/11/23, 12:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.

21/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Oky .We can proceed.
21/11/23, 1:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
21/11/23, 1:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Mickelly 2K23NOV0752)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.

I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
21/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I clearly understand .Thank you .
21/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
21/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you .
21/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Through my counseling sessions ,aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship programme that l am particularly impressed about are : firstly the Earn while you Learn programme .It surely helps students to cover some of the expenses.Also that there are also exposed to career guidance,some of the students need to be directed to the right career path.They are exposed to insights of their jobs like they don't base only on theory learnt in lectures .
21/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Also the Edoofa helps the students through all the processes and a parent is assured that his or her child is in good hands .
21/11/23, 1:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your appreciation of the Earn While You Learn program is well-founded. The program serves as a significant pillar in assisting students to manage some expenses while gaining practical insights into their chosen careers. This practical exposure beyond classroom theory is invaluable, providing students with a realistic understanding of their future professions.

Moreover, the emphasis on career guidance is crucial. Directing students toward the right career path is pivotal in ensuring their academic journey aligns with their aspirations. Edoofa recognizes the importance of this guidance and aims to provide comprehensive support not only academically but also in preparing students for the professional world.
21/11/23, 1:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

21/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome!
22/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Very clear.
22/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I am following
22/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 337 9287: They are all clear .Thank you
22/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Yes please
22/11/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/11/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understandIf you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?ing with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Please share the videos

23/11/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I did understand them .
27/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

29/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: The difference between rights and duties is that rights are associated with freedom ,one has the liberty to do what they .They protect people from oppression whereas duties are associated with responsibilities that is to take liability for something.They are actions which people expect one to do.Human rights are the rights being given to one  by birth or being alive for example the right to eat ,where as civil rights are  obtained by being a citizen of a certain country for example if one works without being paid he or she has the right to report the person to the police (Labour Act).
04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: Human rights are derived from natural law whilist civil law is found in constituition.
04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: 3.Difference between prosecutor and an Attorney is based on that a prosecutor works to prove that a person commited a crime whilist an attorney fights for the right of the accused.He defend the accused of a crime ,he maybe hired by someone or work for the court .Prosecutor works to protect the public .
04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: A prosecutor deal with criminal matters where as an attorney can go as far as civil matters
04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: 4.l am mostly interested in pursuing corporate law because  in our community people are paying money to the wrong people who claim that they own the land we live .The area is not yet developed for a long time because of the barrier .Also my mom's who was devastated because of the properties she bought but when the person died,she left the properties to someone .It was struggle for her to get back her properties .This inspired me to pursue corporate law.

04/12/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Mickelly!

How are you doing this evening?
04/12/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Good evening to you .l am doing fine thank you
04/12/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/12/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 337 9287: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 337 9287: The information is accurate.
04/12/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
04/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I am ready.
04/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/12/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I am aware of that .
04/12/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/12/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/12/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/12/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 337 9287: He did told me .
04/12/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/12/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Yes we are on the same page .
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
04/12/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Well noted
04/12/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
04/12/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
04/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Okay.l get you
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/12/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I don't have any questions
04/12/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/12/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you  once again .
