09/10/23, 10:44 am - Shivjeet Edoofa added you
09/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student.

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you lately. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 326 9377: Yes we can continue
09/10/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Economics)  and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
09/10/23, 6:13 pm - +263 71 326 9377: yes sir this is the correct information
09/10/23, 6:37 pm - +267 75 506 642: Yes we can
09/10/23, 6:37 pm - +267 75 506 642: Very accurate
09/10/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
09/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 326 9377: yes we can start
09/10/23, 6:46 pm - +267 75 506 642: We are ready
09/10/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
09/10/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
09/10/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
09/10/23, 7:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
09/10/23, 7:04 pm - +263 71 326 9377: yes sir
09/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 71 326 9377: well understood
09/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
09/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
09/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
09/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 326 9377: YES SIR
09/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 326 9377: well understood
09/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 8:32 pm - +263 71 326 9377: yes Mr Shivjeet
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
09/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 71 326 9377: well understood sir
09/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Good evening sir, well understood sir
09/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
09/10/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
09/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 71 326 9377: well understood
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 326 9377: explain further on VISA expenses and flight expenses ......the amount
09/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I'll provide a detailed breakdown of the visa and flight expenses:

Visa Expenses:

The student visa fee is approximately $83. This fee is payable to the respective embassy or consulate when applying for the student visa to study in India. The exact amount may vary slightly based on the current exchange rates and specific requirements of the embassy.

Flight Expenses:

The flight expenses can range from approximately $400 to $600 or more, depending on various factors such as the airline, class of travel, booking time, and specific departure and arrival locations. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 326 9377: well understood
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
09/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
09/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 350 1738: I think we are following sir, we are good
09/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 326 9377: well understood thank you sir.....hope we are going to receive the offer letter soon
09/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 326 9377: great sir
09/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 350 1738: If I may ask sir sorry to take you back. Are you saying the visa and the flight expenses are both on the $500-$750
09/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 350 1738: I mean the registration fee from the University
09/10/23, 9:39 pm - +267 75 506 642: Understood
09/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Ok understood now sir. You are saying registration it's part of fees also to secure his his seat. Then apart from that we will need again money for visa and transport separately
09/10/23, 9:41 pm - +267 75 506 642: Ok
09/10/23, 9:43 pm - +267 75 506 642: Indeed
09/10/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, let me clarify. The registration fee you mentioned is indeed part of the overall fees to secure your son's seat and finalize his admission. However, it does not cover the visa and transportation expenses, which are separate. The $500-$750 range is primarily for the registration fee and related admission costs. For visa processing and transportation, additional funds will be required. I hope this clears up any confusion. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions or concerns.
09/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 350 1738: We are now together sir, well understood.
09/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Thank you
09/10/23, 9:49 pm - +267 75 506 642: Well understood
09/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 326 9377: yes we are ready sir
09/10/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 326 9377: we can discuss sir
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 71 326 9377: understood sir
09/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Ooooh ok understood sir
09/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 10:00 pm - +267 75 506 642: Yes Sir
09/10/23, 10:00 pm - +267 75 506 642: Yes Sir
09/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 71 326 9377: yes
09/10/23, 10:02 pm - +267 75 506 642: Yes Sir
09/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Ye sir
09/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Yes sir , we are together
09/10/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 10:08 pm - +267 75 506 642: Foli
09/10/23, 10:08 pm - +267 75 506 642: Following
09/10/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now, and let's connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
09/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 326 9377: well understood
09/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 71 326 9377: thank you sir
09/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Well understood sir
09/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Thank you so much sir ,Good night
09/10/23, 10:12 pm - +267 75 506 642: Thank you so much good nite
10/10/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 5:58 pm - +267 75 506 642: Good evening, waiting for Chelsy he is in Study
10/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that she can catch up to us. Shall we proceed with the session?
10/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Good evening sir , let's proceed sir
10/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 71 326 9377: Good evening we shall proceed
10/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 6:25 pm - +263 71 326 9377: Provide sir
10/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
10/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 326 9377: Well understood
10/10/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 71 326 9377: yes sir
10/10/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Ok ok well understood
10/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 350 1738: It's clear sir
10/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 71 326 9377: clear
10/10/23, 6:59 pm - +263 71 326 9377: we can proceed sir
10/10/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 71 326 9377: thank you sir
10/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 71 326 9377: understood
10/10/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Well understood sir
10/10/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 326 9377: no quaries sir
10/10/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Chelsy's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Chelsy is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
10/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 71 326 9377: yes we are looking foward sir on the next steps and receiving offer letter
10/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Looking forward sit
10/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Sir
10/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Chelsy's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course.

10/10/23, 10:46 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Thank you so much sir

15/10/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 350 1738: Sorry, is it Mr or Ms kkkk

2. 3 years(6 semesters
3. $300
$750
15/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Mr Milan, do I have to worry about the monies on Hostel and Residential fees.. Also if I may ask , I want to be sure here is the Admission and procedure fee  and the registration fee from the Tuition fee of 900.
15/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Also the $300 is wanted within 15 days . Am I correct
15/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Can I hve the list of monies I have to take care of Mr Milan and the time frame of each money
15/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 350 1738: I also noticed of examination fees and student examination fees but this will be cared catered for when the time comes.
15/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Explain to me on the A level results pending. And it says submit before registration
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing all your queries with me here, now stay assured that I have taken note of them and I will help you in understanding more about the same further in our conversation. May I know if we can move ahead with that now?
16/10/23, 6:59 am - +263 77 350 1738: Good morning Mr Milan, how are you today. Please get well soon. We were also experiencing heavy rains this side
16/10/23, 7:52 am - +267 75 506 642: Wish you speed recovery
16/10/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 326 9377: Also the hostel and food which is 2000 or 2500 can yu explain further
16/10/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 326 9377: We can proceed
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chelsy!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I will help you in understanding the same as well. Moving ahead, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
16/10/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 350 1738: Yes that one is clear
16/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 350 1738: And the accomodation fee is paid in full , right.
16/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 350 1738: So if I may ask,  Is EWYL going to help him pay the both Tuition and accommodation   ($3800) per annum
16/10/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please it is true and we will discuss that further during the discussion as well. For now, Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Yes we are
16/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Want to ask before I forget, if    we choose accomodation of $1200 per annum. 
Does it have better security

What about transport to the campus, is it a walkable distance to the school
16/10/23, 7:27 pm - +263 71 326 9377: so only Galgotias accepted my application
17/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chelsy!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the assurance that you needed, right?
17/10/23, 2:18 pm - +267 75 506 642: Waaaaal ,thank you
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
17/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Yes we are clear Mr Milan
17/10/23, 5:30 pm - +263 71 326 9377: very clear
17/10/23, 5:57 pm - +267 75 506 642: Noted
17/10/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 326 9377: we can proceed sir
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Sure we are good. So what's the deadline of the $300 Mr Milan
18/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
18/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 350 1738: I think we will take this one Mr Milan because we still have the balance of $150  which is due on 1 Nove
18/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Will start to pay $300 before 28 October and the other $300 before the 28th of November 2023 Mr Milan
18/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Nop I am in Gweru. Sorry to respond late, I didn't have network.
18/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Just update us of the cheap mode of payment
18/10/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/10/23, 5:15 am - +263 77 350 1738: Ooooh ok, thank you so much sir.
19/10/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chelsy!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 350 1738: Noted sir , thank you

19/10/23, 11:15 pm - +263 77 350 1738: For now we are together, I think will come back you if I have a question
19/10/23, 11:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 11:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour
