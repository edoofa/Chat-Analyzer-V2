Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
24/11/23, 5:26 pm - +263 71 324 6917: May be an hour
24/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 71 324 6917: I will let you know
24/11/23, 5:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect today at 8:00 pm for our next session.
24/11/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Noted
24/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 71 324 6917: I'm have watched all the four video
24/11/23, 7:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
24/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Well, the  founders of Edoofa said that a student have to follow instructions and also do as the admission team told you
24/11/23, 7:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263713246917 Let me add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
24/11/23, 7:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
24/11/23, 7:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
24/11/23, 7:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
24/11/23, 7:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
24/11/23, 7:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
24/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes, l agree with you
24/11/23, 8:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
24/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes, we are
24/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 71 324 6917: I'm following, lets move forward to the second step
24/11/23, 8:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263713246917, Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
24/11/23, 8:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

With reference to your journey,  I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?

Yes, my network is not stable thus why l did not complete the SOP
28/11/23, 11:54 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am well dear, thank you for asking. I can understand that you are having network challenges, however dear we shared the form with you on Friday and it has been 4 four days. May I know if you have complete the form now?
28/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 71 324 6917: I did except the SOP
28/11/23, 12:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, in that case please make sure to complete the SOP form today, and in the meantime you can share your response for the academic interview question as you have completed the same. <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 12:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: On this note, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (28-Nov-2023).
28/11/23, 12:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/JIvYqBz4FZQKeubasc4Zfj
28/11/23, 12:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Tawanda Spencer Murwira, and my EWYL group name is Tawanda EWYL23E0945. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (28-Nov-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
28/11/23, 12:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
28/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Alright, noted
28/11/23, 12:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263713246917, I am glad to know that you have taken a note of my message. Now, before we start today's session, I would like to understand by when you will be able to complete the pending documents which are your SOP form and academic interview question?
28/11/23, 1:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/11/23, 1:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/11/23, 1:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Noted
28/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes, he did
28/11/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes, we're on the same page
28/11/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
28/11/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?* <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Noted
28/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
28/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350. The installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Okay
28/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Noted
28/11/23, 1:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
28/11/23, 1:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
28/11/23, 1:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
28/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 324 6917: I'm following
28/11/23, 1:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
28/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Right now it's clear l will ask if l have queries
28/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, On this note May I please know if you were able to complete your pending SOP form?
28/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Not yet
28/11/23, 8:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please make sure to complete the form today dear
28/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Okay, noted
28/11/23, 8:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, We will have a session tomorrow at 1:00pm, till then please complete the form as it's important in order to submit your application at the university. With this, Let's conclude our session for today, Have a good day!
28/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 324 6917: I will make sure that the form is completed
28/11/23, 9:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that @263713246917
28/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Okay, you as well
28/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 324 6917: I have completed the SOP ma'am
28/11/23, 9:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good @263713246917
28/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Okay, thank you
29/11/23, 12:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tawanda, I hope you are doing well. 

In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
29/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes, I'm available
29/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation Tawanda, Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes, off course
29/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Okay
29/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Tawanda. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
29/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
29/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Okay, l can see that
29/11/23, 2:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
29/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
29/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
29/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
29/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 324 6917: I'm following
29/11/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
29/11/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
29/11/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
29/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Noted
29/11/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
29/11/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
29/11/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 324 6917: No
29/11/23, 2:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Could you please let me know the reason why this explanation does not resonate with you?
29/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Because the fees strucure remain constant in alignment with academic year of 2023.
29/11/23, 2:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, With this benefit, it's a plus point for you. I am not able to understand your thought process here, could you please elaborate?
29/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Since the fees strucure is constant therefore there is nothing to worry about 
As you assist students in managing changes of fess structures
29/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that dear, Let's proceed with the next benefit.
29/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
29/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes
29/11/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
29/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/11/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 10, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
29/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 324 6917: No, it is very clear
29/11/23, 3:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
29/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes, I'm
29/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 324 6917: But l don't know how l would be assessed for the offer letter
29/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
29/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
29/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.

Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
29/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 324 6917: I'm following
29/11/23, 3:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
29/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes
29/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
29/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Noted
29/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 71 324 6917: I'm following
29/11/23, 7:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
29/11/23, 7:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
29/11/23, 7:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, You  will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
29/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 324 6917: What about if one chooses to reappear exam in June 2024
29/11/23, 7:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263713246917 This benefit will still be in the terms if the students wants to give reappear exam in June 2024, I hope that's clear?
29/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes
29/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes
29/11/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
29/11/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
29/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 71 324 6917: Yes
29/11/23, 7:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
29/11/23, 7:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
29/11/23, 7:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 71 324 6917: No, you have explained well ma'am
29/11/23, 8:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263713246917 So, are you excited to initiate the process?
