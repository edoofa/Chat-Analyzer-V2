I hope this message finds you in good health.

I am Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer at Edoofa. Currently, I am diligently reviewing the application files of students who are preparing to join us for the 2023 intake in India. During this process, I noticed that you have plans to commence your studies at PDM University.
12/09/23, 7:47 am - Milan Edoofa: As we eagerly await the arrival date confirmation from PDM University, I wanted to mention that we recently engaged in a conversation to finalize the details, and the university has indicated that they will be providing us with an update within this week.

Given the time at hand, I would like to seize this opportunity to discuss a potential option with you that could potentially enhance both the affordability and enrichment of your higher education experience in India. Would now be a suitable time for us to engage in this discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion?

12/09/23, 7:55 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to learn that you are open to discussing this matter. Before we get into the specifics, I wanted to share a recent development that could significantly influence your educational journey.

Edoofa has recently established a partnership with a new university here in India. This collaboration has prompted the academic board to revisit scholarship opportunities for a select group of students, including yourself, with the intention of providing a more enhanced educational pathway.
12/09/23, 7:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Under this new collaboration, the university is offering more substantial scholarship opportunities for the course related to your field of study, particularly in the field of Law.

Through this unique opportunity, you are in a position to secure a remarkable 90% scholarship on your tuition fee, along with a 100% sponsorship for your accommodation expenses. What's particularly striking is the potential to significantly alleviate the financial burdens tied to education. This could effectively bring down your annual expenses to just $1600, encompassing all essential aspects of your education and residence.
12/09/23, 7:56 am - Milan Edoofa: I am eager to hear your initial thoughts on this matter. Would you be interested in exploring this specialized course further and getting into the finer details of how this opportunity could potentially transform your educational journey?
12/09/23, 7:58 am - +263 78 620 1506: Yes sir
12/09/23, 8:03 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know that you are ready to know more about the opportunity. Moving ahead, after thorough reconsideration of your application as well as a proper analysis of your documents, the academic board has suggested that you should pursue the course BA LLB for your higher education here in India for the given opportunity since it would help you in having a better career in the future as well as you would also be able to make your higher education even more affordable. I hope you understand?
12/09/23, 8:04 am - +263 78 620 1506: Yes noted sir
12/09/23, 8:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, The name of the University is MVN University, and they are situated in the National Capital Region here in India. Moreover, their intake is about to begin since they have already released the dates for their students and that is in the month of September by the last week. Isn't that wonderful? <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 8:09 am - +263 78 620 1506: It is wonderful
12/09/23, 8:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -

12/09/23, 8:52 am - Milan Edoofa: No, please Tadiwanashe, you won't have to start again dear. The registration fee that you had paid earlier for PDM University will be shifted for your admission at MVN please.
12/09/23, 8:52 am - Milan Edoofa: If I may ask what is the reason that you are not interested in moving ahead with MVN instead of PDM please?
12/09/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 620 1506: I think it will take time because l am supposed to come there tomorrow but the admission team is not yet give me the online visa application form so l think shifting too will give me pressure and more days here
12/09/23, 8:55 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case Tadiwanashe, if I may ask have you already booked your tickets please? <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 620 1506: And sir can yu help me by sending some receipts the enrollment fee and the registration
12/09/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 620 1506: Yes yesterday but yesterday but l don't have the online visa form so the Embassy wont be able to grant me the visa so today am going to postpone my flight
12/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 620 1506: How about the visa requirements too sir
12/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 620 1506: Sir can you please kindly send me my receipts
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, here I would like to mention that, since we are having a discussion about getting you a better university for your higher education so that you can get more affordable option and along with that you can also get better quality education. I hope this is clear, right?
12/09/23, 2:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding, Tadiwanashe. I appreciate your patience and willingness to explore this opportunity. Now, let me highlight a few key reasons why MVN University might be a better choice for your higher education compared to PDM:
12/09/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. Scholarship Opportunity*: As mentioned earlier, MVN University is offering a remarkable 90% scholarship on your tuition fees, along with 100% sponsorship for accommodation expenses. This can significantly reduce the financial burden of your education, making it more affordable.

*2. Quality Education*: MVN University is recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and holds accreditation from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). These recognitions ensure high academic standards and quality education.

*3. Modern Facilities*: MVN University's campus is equipped with modern facilities, including state-of-the-art classrooms, well-equipped laboratories, extensive libraries, comfortable hostels, and sports facilities. These facilities create an optimal learning environment for students.

I hope you are following till here?
12/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Yes l understand but my mom said we have to opt for PDM because l have even relatives from PDM so it was  a good idea
12/09/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask who is your relative studying at PDM dear?
12/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Natasha Mubvumbanyama
12/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 620 1506: She is my sister
12/09/23, 3:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: I see, Natasha is your sister, and she's currently studying at PDM University. It's understandable that having a relative studying at the same university can provide a sense of familiarity and support.

However, on that note, I would also like to mention that PDM University is just an hour or two away from MVN, hence, you can always choose to visit your sister or vice versa, when you will be studying at MVN, I hope you understand that right? <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 620 1506: I do understand but l have to let my mother knows it too
13/09/23, 8:21 am - +263 78 620 1506: Good morning ms Vilsha can you please kindly send me the visa online form link

13/09/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tadiwanashe!

13/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Ok
13/09/23, 2:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is completely true. Now, on that note, I would also like to mention that as per the rankings that we have received recently MVN is much better than PDM in terms of quality of education as well as the facilities that it offers. Hence, you can surely move ahead to finalize your admission at MVN please. I hope this is clear now?
13/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Yes its clear
13/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 620 1506: So what is the fee structure of the University
13/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 620 1506: And how long does it take to complete the forms

13/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 620 1506: But sir this is going to take a long time of which l have to be there by next week
13/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 620 1506: So when will l be coming there
13/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear. And Tadiwanashe, can you please let me know why is it that you have booked your flight tickets already dear?
13/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 620 1506: No not the flight ticket but the dummy ticket.. I was given the arrival date here which was 13th of September and it seems like things are changing
13/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 620 1506: 1. The visa online application was being send here which had details of LPU of which l didnt opted for LPU but PDM which l was supposed to be sent the bonafide letter from it.
13/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 620 1506: So the process is now confusing me
13/09/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, I get that, however, now you do not have to be confused and not book any tickets until we ask you to do so. Moreover, when it comes to moving ahead with your admission at MVN University, we will now proceed to share your application with them and as soon as we receive a response from them, we will let you know.

13/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Because am afraid that the response it will take long. And is the scholarship surely 90% on tution and 100% for accommodation
13/09/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please Tadiwanashe, you won't have to worry about that since, it would not take that much time. Additionally, the students of MVN can arrive here in India by the month of October as well, hence, you do not have to worry about the same. 

Moreover, when it comes to the scholarship percentage, yes please dear it will be the same and the costs after scholarshipu will come out to be $1500-1900 per annum please.
13/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 620 1506: October its too far sir

15/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Ok noted
15/09/23, 12:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding your query, I would first like to mention that it is not true, since PDM hasn't yet released their arrival dates.
15/09/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Ok noted
15/09/23, 12:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, with that I do have an update to share with you here. After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from MVN University, along with a remarkable 90% scholarship!

15/09/23, 12:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a 90% scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
15/09/23, 12:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 620 1506: That's great news thank you sir
15/09/23, 12:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome dear. Now, please go through the letter and once you are done with that, please let me know of the same.
15/09/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 620 1506: I am done with it
15/09/23, 12:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
15/09/23, 12:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
15/09/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 620 1506: 1. $350
2. 0
3. $1 600
4. $125
5. $1 000
15/09/23, 12:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/09/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Yes sir
15/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/09/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
15/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Yes sir
15/09/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
15/09/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Yes noted
15/09/23, 12:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
15/09/23, 12:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
15/09/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Yes and l have a question sir
15/09/23, 12:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, what is it?
15/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 620 1506: So far how much have l earned from the EWYL program
15/09/23, 12:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, may I know if \you are in touch with your EWYL Mentor please?
15/09/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 620 1506: Ok noted we can continue
15/09/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note Tadiwanashe, I would like to mention that the EWYL Credits of a student can only be used to reduce their tuition fee and not the registration fee, since a student only becomes eligible to use the credits once the admission is completed.
15/09/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, how do you plan to cater for the balance admission fee further please?
15/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 264 0272: Monday morning
15/09/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Can you please also let me know of this as well?

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the cab. The cab will take approximately two hours to reach the university campus. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus.

Dear Parents and Guardians,

We hope this message finds you well. We have made several attempts to remind you about the outstanding tuition fees of *$425* 

This message serves as an official warning from the university administration. Failing to settle the outstanding tuition fees will have severe consequences for your child's academic progress. We understand that financial situations can be challenging, and we are committed to assisting you in any way we can. <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 11:14 am - +91 93546 23922: Consequences of not paying fee is *Academic Loss* Students with unpaid fees may not be allowed to attend classes, which will directly impact their education. This absence may result in missing crucial lectures, assignments, and exams. Attendance records would therefore be affected and hence Consistent absences due to unpaid fees can lead to a significant drop in attendance, potentially preventing your child to take up exams and therefore backlogs. Accumulating backlogs can result in additional academic challenges and the imposition of high penalty charges.

We genuinely care about your child's education and well-being, and we want to ensure they have every opportunity to succeed. Therefore, we are issuing this warning in advance to prevent any confusion and to allow you ample time to address the outstanding tuition fees.

Our primary goal is to support your child's academic journey and ensure they receive the education they deserve. Your cooperation is crucial in this regard, and we trust that you will take this warning seriously.

22/11/23, 12:12 pm - +91 93546 23922: Dear Parents,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of utmost importance regarding your child's academic standing at the college.

Despite several reminders and extensive conversations, it has come to our attention that the outstanding fees for your child's education have not been settled. We have made diligent efforts to work with you, engaging in negotiations with the university on your behalf. Regrettably, these efforts have not yielded a resolution, and the outstanding payment remains unresolved.

As a result of the persistent non-payment, the college has taken the difficult decision to block your child's access to classes. This means that, effective immediately, your child will be unable to attend any classes until the outstanding fees are settled.

We understand that financial matters can be challenging, and we have been committed to finding an amicable solution. However, the prolonged non-payment has left us with no alternative but to take this measure.

We urge you to address this matter urgently to ensure your child's uninterrupted academic progress. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. We believe that together we can resolve this issue and continue to support your child's educational journey.
