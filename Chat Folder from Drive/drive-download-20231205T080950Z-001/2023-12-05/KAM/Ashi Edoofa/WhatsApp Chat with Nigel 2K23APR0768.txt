02/08/23, 1:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nigel,

I hope this message finds you in high spirits, and I trust that everything is going smoothly with your visa application process. I wanted to inquire if you have managed to complete the visa application form by now, or if you require any assistance with it?

If there's anything I can do to help or if you have any questions about the application, please don't hesitate to ask. We are here to support you throughout the process and ensure a successful application at the embassy.
02/08/23, 2:09 pm - +27 84 209 6026: Good afternoon. We havent completed the Visa Application form yet. We are still busy trying to sort the Bank Statement aspect of it abd i think by midweek next week we would have put up enough resources to acquire the bank statement with money equivalent to a Semester's tuition fee. We will then go ahead and process other requirements. Thank you
02/08/23, 2:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, I understand and that is absolutely fine, take your time. Once you are done with the visa application form, kindly share the form with me here so I can crosscheck all the details and ensure everything is accurate. This will help us move forward with the next steps in the process smoothly.
02/08/23, 2:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: If you encounter any issues or have any questions during the form submission, feel free to reach out, and we will be here to assist you. We look forward to receiving the downloaded form.
02/08/23, 2:12 pm - +27 84 209 6026: Ok sir. Noted. Thank you.
04/08/23, 9:07 pm - +27 84 209 6026: Good evening sir. We need your advice and guidance here. In the event that Nigel fails to avail himself during the start of the first semester on 6 September is it possible for him to start later when the schools have opened or in the second semester? The reason why i am asking is because i am seeing that we are running out of time to pull up enough resources to have everything needed in time. We had hoped to have finalised the bank statement issue by next week but its not looking good. Even if we pass that hurdle there are flight issues to be sorted  and all the preparations for a new student abroad. Accomodation fees included. So we thought we should bring this to your attention before its late maybe his arrival can be rescheduked to a later date or month. So your assitance and advise on this issue will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
07/08/23, 9:33 am - +27 84 209 6026: Good morning sir. We are still kindly waiting for your assistance and guidance regarding our situation. Thank you.

18/09/23, 10:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nigel,

I am Ms. Vilsha, the head of admissions at Edoofa. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi has been feeling a bit under the weather for the past two days and, unfortunately, won't be able to connect with you. 

However, in her absence, please rest assured that I am here to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have.
18/09/23, 10:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Addressing your last message @27842096026, we understand your need for a bit more time to make necessary arrangements before your son's departure, and we appreciate your cooperation in this matter.

After careful consideration, we can offer two alternative arrival dates for your son:

1. Arrival between 26th September
2. Arrival on 4th October.

These dates should provide you with the additional time you require for preparations. We hope one of these options aligns better with your schedule, and we look forward to welcoming your son into the next batch.
18/09/23, 10:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Additionally, please note that the university will be closed from 20th September to 24th September and hence per the strict instructions shared by them, students are not supposed to plan their arrival during this period.
19/09/23, 4:14 am - +27 84 209 6026: Good morning mam. Firstly we are so touched  to learn that Ms Ashi is not feeling well. We wish and pray she gets well soon. Secondly we would like to thank you for attendong to our concerns.
19/09/23, 4:20 am - +27 84 209 6026: We have taken note of the new arrival dates offered. We will notify you our prefered arrival day by the end of the day today after discussing with the family. We really appreciate your assistance. Once again, thank you so much.
19/09/23, 4:21 am - +27 84 209 6026: Noted mam. Thank you.
19/09/23, 5:55 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely, Parents and Nigel, that would be absolutely fine. Please share an update with us today so that we can communicate with the university officials as well. Along with this, I also have an update to share with you concerning the arrival instructions for your travel.
19/09/23, 5:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is important to mention that the university and the route from the airport to the campus will be closed due to a VVIP event scheduled in the vicinity. The event, MotoGP 2023, will take place from September 20th to September 24th at the Buddha International Circuit. 

For security reasons, all roads will remain closed during this period, as the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Chief Ministers, and International VIPs are expected to utilize Galgotias University's world-class infrastructure for this event.

Hence, it is crucial for you to plan for your arrival on the designated arrival dates shared. I hope you have taken note of this update?
19/09/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 262 0323: Good evening sir. From the arrival dates that you have given us we have chosen the arrival date of the 4th of Oct. Preparations are already in place to ensure prompt arrival
19/09/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 262 0323: Yes we have sir. Is there any expected time of arrival?
19/09/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 262 0323: Good evening sir we would like to ask if he should carry original copies of his educational certificates. And on the issue of his visa we noticed it is for 1yr. How is  it  renewed and where.
19/09/23, 11:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your messages and for letting us know of the finalized arrival date of October 4th. Your preparations are much appreciated, and we look forward to Nigel's arrival in India.
19/09/23, 11:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Regarding the expected time of arrival, it's recommended that students consider flights landing in the morning around 08:00. You can consider flights such as Et686 and QR 570 for your convenience.
19/09/23, 11:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As for the educational certificates, students have to carry the original copies with them. These documents will be required for verification purposes during the reporting process at the universiy.
19/09/23, 11:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Regarding the visa, the duration and renewal process depends on the specific visa type your student holds, and hence most of the student visas are only valid for 6 to 12 months. Visa extensions are processed after the student arrives in India and has completed their reporting procedures. 

The university's international student affairs team will provide guidance on the renewal process and any necessary documentation needed for the same. I hope this addresses the query you had?
20/09/23, 5:27 am - +263 77 262 0323: Morning sir thank you for the clarification on all issues. We have managed to book a flight for him an arrival time of 1.45 am. Considering that it will be at night he will have to wait till morning at his arrival port. So my final question now is who will he get in touch with for assistance from then onwards

After you check out from the airport, do not leave the premises or take a taxi from the airport to the university. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and give a call to Mr. Rithvik at the number: +91 7696398732

3. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
