I hope you are doing well, I really appreciate your understanding and patience, however, I do feel better now so may I know if you are available to connect with us now to proceed ahead with the discussion?
14/08/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 982 1695: I am available now
14/08/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/08/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/08/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes we are clear
14/08/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/08/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/08/23, 5:43 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes I am
14/08/23, 5:44 pm - +263 78 982 1695: so step 3 is in the form of a video call..since it's timed
14/08/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand, no it will not be in the form of a video call, however, it will be carried through this platform only through texts.
14/08/23, 11:58 pm - +263 78 982 1695: okay
15/08/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 982 1695: good afternoon
16/08/23, 11:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, since we could not continue with our conversation may I know if you were able to connect with us now and move forward with the discussion?
16/08/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes we can continue
16/08/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/08/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/08/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 982 1695: so after paying the $500 -$700 I'm suppose to pay the fees
16/08/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263789821695 please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
16/08/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 982 1695: so what determines the amount of registration fees I am supposed to pay
16/08/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263789821695 The registration fee amount depends on the university and is determined by specific metrics, including the chosen academic program, the university's fee structure, and the availability of scholarships at the given time. As previously mentioned, you can be confident that the registration fee will fall within the range of $500 to $750. To be on the safer side, we strongly recommend all the parents that prepare the registration fee of $750. Should the fee amount be lower than this, it can serve as savings for you and can also be allocated toward your future expenses. 

I hope that this attends to the query you had?
16/08/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes it does
16/08/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 982 1695: we may proceed now
16/08/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
17/08/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 982 1695: yes we can
17/08/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gugulethu.

17/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
17/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
17/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
17/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

17/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
17/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
17/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
17/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 982 1695: okay I'm going through them now
17/08/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response, Please let me know once you are able to go through the videos.

17/08/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, let me share the audio version of the 4th video and we can connect again at 09.00 pm today.
17/08/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 982 1695: thank you
17/08/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, may I know if you were able to go through the last audio/ video by now?
18/08/23, 1:45 am - +263 78 982 1695: yeah I have gone through it
18/08/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, thank you for asking, I am doing great. Since you have mentioned that you were able to go through the videos so could you please share your understanding of the videos?
18/08/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 982 1695: i understood that Edoofa not only secures a place for a student but also sees to it that the student is employable in the current economy
18/08/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 982 1695: and that they see to it that you go to the best school as they consider us their children
18/08/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
18/08/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
18/08/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
18/08/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes I did understand that
18/08/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
18/08/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 982 1695: okay
18/08/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Todat at 09.00 pm.
18/08/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
18/08/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
18/08/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. 1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
18/08/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 982 1695: I don't have my Alevel results as of now
18/08/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 982 1695: I'm writing this year
18/08/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263789821695 I am aware of that, and that is why you can share the statement of entry for A- level if you have that because most of the students have them from now.
18/08/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yeah I do have that
18/08/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, you can share that also.
18/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
19/08/23, 8:02 am - +263 78 982 1695: greetings yesterday I failed to follow think and to download the PDFs you sent me due to network

21/08/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now, I noticed that you were able to go through the message before?
22/08/23, 8:11 am - +263 78 982 1695: good morning
22/08/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 982 1695: sorry for ignoring you it's just that I have been having second thoughts about this whole scholarship thing and I figured out that it is costly so I have decided to learn locally where I can qualify to be a medical practitioner with the subjects  that I do at A level . so I have decided to channel my energy into that pathways , sorry for the inconvinience
22/08/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, I appreciate you being transparent with your thoughts here. In that case, could you please help me know the per-semester fees if you are considering local admissions?
23/08/23, 7:28 am - +263 78 982 1695: good morning
23/08/23, 7:29 am - +263 78 982 1695: I think it's about $350 -$400 . that's what I was told from my sources
23/08/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, let me help you explain since you mentioned that in Zimbabwe per semester fees are $350-$400 to be on the safer side let us assume it is $500, now as you must be aware each academic year consist of 2 semesters so that will make your per annum cost of $1000 only for the tuition fee. 

Now, if you go to a university you will eventually move out and live close to the university, and for that accommodation, the cost could come up to $50 per month which will make your yearly accommodation cost $600, and moving on to the food, for a decent meal it costs $2 per meal, and for you to have 3 meals it will cost you $6 and this will also cost you yearly $600. Plus some miscellaneous costs of the examination fee which can cost up to $150 per annum.
23/08/23, 11:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now if we sum up the cost here, $1000 + $600 + $600 + $150 = $2350, and this will be the balance if you choose any local university and not the expensive ones and keeping in mind Zimbabwe's economy that degree will not be enough for you to make you employable.

However, here at Edoofa, we make sure that from the tuition fee to accommodation and food everything is covered within the $2000-$3000, and with the affordable education you will also get an international degree recognition alongside the EWYL program that specifically focuses on skill development and making students employable ready. I hope you are able to understand now?
23/08/23, 12:17 pm - +263 78 982 1695: I understand thank you for letting me know I will reconsider my decision
23/08/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation in the personal window, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
23/08/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes I am
23/08/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know by when will you be able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks?
23/08/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 982 1695: I'm not sure but I have it filled by tomorrow
23/08/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, can I anticipate that you will be able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks by tomorrow 01.00 pm?
23/08/23, 11:25 pm - +263 78 982 1695: okay
24/08/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 982 1695: i have filled the statement of purpose
24/08/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us. May I know by when will you be able to share the academic interview questions?
24/08/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 982 1695: before 9 pm today
24/08/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response.
25/08/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 982 1695: 2) What are the different types of macro-nutrients , explain and classify them with suitable examples?
- The two types are polysaccharides and polypeptides.Polysaccharides are made up of of simple sugars like glucose , fructose and galactose. examples of polysaccharides are starch, glycogen and cellulose.Polypeptides are made up of amino acid monomers . these are classified into Fibrous (keratin ), Globular (enzymes) and intermediate (Fibrinogen).

3) What are enzymes and what are the factors that affect the enzyme activity?
-enzymes are protein molecules that act as biological catalyst to speed up the rate of anabolic and metabolic reactions by providing an alternative pathway usually by lowering the activation energy. pH, Temperature and inhibitor affect the enzyme activity.

4) Which are the different types of vitamins, give an example of their source
-The different types of vitamins are Vitamin A, VitaminB, Vitamin C and Vitamin D .Vitamin A and B are found in animal products like meat , milk , eggs and fish-liver oils . Vitamin C is found in fruits and vegetables. Vitamin D is found from sunlight and carrots.

4) Define hormones, classify them with example

The classes are peptides (corticotrophins) , Steroids (estrogens ) , Amino acid derivatives (neropinephrine) and Fatty acid derivatives ( prostaglandins).
25/08/23, 10:22 am - +263 78 982 1695: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
25/08/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
25/08/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
25/08/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes that's correct
25/08/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
25/08/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes
25/08/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
25/08/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
25/08/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes I understand
25/08/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
25/08/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
25/08/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
25/08/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 982 1695: I understand
25/08/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
25/08/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes
25/08/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
25/08/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yesp
25/08/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
25/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
25/08/23, 10:15 pm - +263 78 982 1695: okp
25/08/23, 10:16 pm - +263 78 982 1695: good evening
25/08/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
26/08/23, 4:55 am - +263 77 389 0618: Greetings, may l know when the admission fee of 500-750 may be needed? For example is it for next year after results are out or before the end of the year?I have to prepared.
28/08/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, since it was the weekend, hence we could not get back to you. Yes, please let me help you understand since you have already shared your statement for entry for A- A-level, which will be enough for the universities to generate your offer letter. Since your year of intake is 2024. For a rough idea, you can consider that the admission fee of $500- $750 will be required till mid-September or early October. 

I hope we are clear here?
28/08/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
29/08/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 982 1695: okay
29/08/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 982 1695: yes
29/08/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, I am glad to know that you are clear now. As you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.

Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
04/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our discussion for the 6th of September at 01.30 P.M. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session.

I hope you are doing well, with regards to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
07/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you however, you did not respond, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, I understand that power cut can be a challenge, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
08/09/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 982 1695: yes I am
08/09/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great.  Now I believe you have had a discussion with your family regarding your admission process, so I would like to know if you have any queries or concerns to share?
08/09/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 982 1695: no there are none but will surely let you know if there are any
08/09/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
08/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 982 1695: no I wasn't
08/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand Gugulethu, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
08/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
08/09/23, 2:55 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
08/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Thank you so much for making it easy to pay the registration fee. It wasn't going to be easy to pay $750 at once
08/09/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, Indeed, considering that, the Academic Board came up with this Solution so, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
08/09/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes
09/09/23, 11:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for the delay in response, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 78 982 1695: greetings Ms Kirti  I'm sorry for the late reply, but I'm not available on the sabbath, I'm a seventh day Adventist , I will be at church on Saturdays
11/09/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Gugulethu.

12/09/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 982 1695: good morning p

I hope you are doing well, I was expecting to connect with you yesterday, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
12/09/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 982 1695: I'll be available around at 11 am
12/09/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges as I am certain that you are aware of our available working hours?
13/09/23, 6:20 am - +263 78 982 1695: yes ,I am very much under pressure as I'm preparing for my final exams so I may not be able to available
13/09/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, I completely understand that, in that case, may I know if your parents are available to connect with us now?
13/09/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 982 1695: I don't know but I'm sure they will soon as they get the message
13/09/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, please inform your parents to be active in the group as they can attend the discussions on your behalf.
13/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 389 0618: I'm available now.
13/09/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
13/09/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes. Kind clarify for us
13/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
13/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 389 0618: No l was not aware of that. Thank you for  considering us and taking note of that disadvantage
13/09/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/09/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
13/09/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Thus great. However can you further clarify on point number 7 especially the part on "guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of ......'
13/09/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits in detail now.
13/09/23, 4:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
13/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes it is
13/09/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
13/09/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
13/09/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Well articulated and understood, thank you.
13/09/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
13/09/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/09/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes. I perfectly understand that.
13/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
13/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
13/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 389 0618: I understand everything and got that from the last time l asked if the payments were expected next year
13/09/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
13/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 389 0618: More information please 🙏
13/09/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
13/09/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
13/09/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
13/09/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Okay. I get it now
13/09/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
13/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes
13/09/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
13/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes, but l would opt for number 2 ,thus if l could be asked to choose
13/09/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: yes, indeed. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe Gugulethu will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once her results come in 2024, she will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue her bachelor's degree then.
13/09/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for her exams, and her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
13/09/23, 10:36 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes it's clear
14/09/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday?

16/09/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes l am. Unless you feel there might be an additional information l may need
16/09/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, now moving further, 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and instead of reappearing for his/her exams and starting with his/her Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
16/09/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Okay
16/09/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
16/09/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Thus understandable and clear
16/09/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 389 0618: We just hope and pray for good passes and that Gugu pursue her degree on the next intake
16/09/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed, she will surely get good grades, and make you proud, Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
16/09/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Can we move forward
16/09/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes, they are clear.
16/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
16/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
16/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
16/09/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes we are on the same page. I here by give the go ahead on the proceedings. Im am mentally prepared although financial is another issue. But l promise to run around and make ends meet whenever it is needed.
16/09/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, however, let us complete the discussion first @263773890618 so, may I know if you are ready?
16/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes l am
16/09/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
16/09/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
16/09/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
16/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes
16/09/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
16/09/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes go ahead and clarify the two for me please.
16/09/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 16th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 01st of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
16/09/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes l understand
16/09/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
16/09/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
16/09/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 16th of September, the deadline becomes the 01st of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 16th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 01st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 01st of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
16/09/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 389 0618: We are on the same page and l opt for the Early Registration/ University Admission process
16/09/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
16/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 389 0618: They are clear . I chose the second option because it gives me time to harness my meagre resources and pay what is due in order for my child to get the opportunity to learn abroad
16/09/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great  now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
16/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 389 0618: If l got you correctly the issues are as follows. If we consider R750 as the university registration fee, the first Standard procedure requires payment to be done within the 15 days after receiving the offer letter from the university. Then the  second option.(Early Decision Benefits) has an advantage of a$150 waiver that would be paid by Edoofa. That leaves me with the obligation to pay $600 . The other advantage of the second option is that in this option l can pay it in instalments. Ie $300  in 15 days then the remaining within the next 30 days. I hope l got it well
19/09/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Gugulethu,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students.
19/09/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
20/09/23, 5:34 am - +263 77 389 0618: Good morning. Yes l clearly understand that.
20/09/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Gugulethu.

I hope you are doing well, I am glad to know that you are clear, may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the admission process?
20/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 982 1695: good afternoon ma'am
20/09/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263789821695 I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us?
20/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes l am
20/09/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
20/09/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *01st October* and *01st November*.
20/09/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *01st of October and 01st of November*), can you give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Gugulethu's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
20/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 389 0618: I am opting for the second option, that of Early registration. I also give you the green light to proceed with the university application procedures
20/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *01st of October and 01st of November*), can you give us the *go-ahead* so that we can prepare Gugulethu's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities?
20/09/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes
20/09/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes we are confortable
20/09/23, 10:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Gugulethu's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Gugulethu's higher education well.
20/09/23, 10:50 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Great we will do so.
20/09/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
20/09/23, 10:54 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Okay. Thank you
20/09/23, 10:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
26/09/23, 1:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Gugulethu!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
26/09/23, 1:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 12.30 PM. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
26/09/23, 1:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Thank you , it's so thrilling and we are so happy. Looking forward to work with you amicable and with dedication
26/09/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome! We will now connect with each other tomorrow at the scheduled time to discuss about the letter. Until then, have a good day!
26/09/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Thanks
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Gugulethu!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
27/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 982 1695: good afternoon
27/09/23, 2:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263789821695 May I know if you were able to go through the offer letter from Galgotias University by now?
27/09/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Tuition fee per semester is $900. Totallying to $1800 annually.
2 Duration of course is 3 years. ie 6 semesters
3.The admission and procedure fee is $300.
4
27/09/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 389 0618: 4 registration fee is $750 but since we opted for Early registration it would be $600
27/09/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
27/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 389 0618: I understood that perfectly
27/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
27/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Okay
27/09/23, 4:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
27/09/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes l am . Thank you for the clarification. Kindly assist me on payment procedures. How do l deposit the funds in that account?
28/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Gugulethu!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to discuss that moving ahead during our conversation please. For now, I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
28/09/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 389 0618: Yes. it means that the$200 exam fee added to tuition fees will add up to $2000  which was within the $2000_$3000 fees you explained during counseling setions .
28/09/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is very true! Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
28/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes. It is
28/09/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
28/09/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
28/09/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
28/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes. I will deposit the $300 before the 8th of October
28/09/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that pleas. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 389 0618: I don't have a foreign currency axchange bank account
28/09/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Due to that, there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 389 0618: I reside in Tsholotsho district which is a rural community in Matabeleland North province. The nearest town is Bulawayo which is roufly 250 km away.
28/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Will try to call him and see but getting there is quit a challenge
28/09/23, 3:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
28/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes. That is better. Thank you
28/09/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
28/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Thank you once again
28/09/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
28/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Okay.  We will work around that
28/09/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/09/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 389 0618: Yes. I understand that
28/09/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 389 0618: I understand. We will be willing to accept the program. And she Will begin working on that after her final national examination
28/09/23, 4:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
28/09/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 389 0618: I don't have any query
28/09/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
28/09/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour
