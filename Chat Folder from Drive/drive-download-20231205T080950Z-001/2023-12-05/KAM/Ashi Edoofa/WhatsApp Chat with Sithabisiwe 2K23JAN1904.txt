02/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 148 1985: They said my bank statement is not balanced it is supposed to have a balance that will cover my tuition fee of the whole year not of only one semester.
02/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 148 1985: Its just that I met with this other girl and she told me that she will be in  India on the14th because she wants to settle first before starting school.
02/08/23, 8:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Sithabisiwe, that is correct, the balance in your bank statement should be enough to cover the expenses for your first-year fee. To address the issue with the bank statement, I recommend contacting your bank as soon as possible to discuss the situation and explore options to meet the required balance. They will offer guidance on how to achieve this or provide alternatives to demonstrate sufficient funds for the entire academic year.
02/08/23, 8:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Regarding your plans to arrive in India, it's great to hear that you've made connections with other students. However, I am concerned that you might have received factually incorrect information. The official arrival date for all students, including yourself, has been shared as 6th September, and no student is supposed to report to the university before this date. The university has been meticulously making the necessary arrival arrangements in accordance with this specific date.

To ensure that all students have a seamless arrival experience, it is crucial that everyone follows the designated schedule. If you could kindly share the name of your friend who mentioned the 14th as her arrival date, I can personally verify this information and provide any necessary clarifications or corrections to avoid any misunderstandings?
02/08/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 148 1985: Noted will make a plan.
02/08/23, 10:21 pm - +263 71 148 1985: I think this person is not under Edoofa.We did not have enough time to discuss everything as she was buisy preparing for her submission and I was also buisy .May I know if you can send me any number of an Edoofian who will be going to the same university as me.
03/08/23, 7:13 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, I understand @263711481985 and addressing your request, the contact details for the students who would be joining Galgotias University would be shared with you in due time. An official from the Department of student welfare would be connecting with you after you have booked your flight tickets just to ensure you are connected with the students and to help you plan your arrival to India in a batch of students.
03/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 71 148 1985: Okay noted Thank you.

I hope this message finds you well. We previously shared important information regarding off-campus accommodation arrangements, and we wanted to follow up to ensure everything is proceeding smoothly.

Could you please let us know if you have been able to book your accommodation by now? If you haven't, have you been able to reach out to Ms. Eugene at her provided number?

Your response will help us ensure that all necessary arrangements for your arrival are in place, and hence we are looking to get a response before 01:00 PM. We are here to assist you every step of the way.
31/08/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 148 1985: Good afternoon.I have been in touch with Mrs Eugen but I couldn't deposit the money .

I am interested in understanding the specific difficulties you faced during this process.
31/08/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 148 1985: Your arrangements came to us late.We thought we have to look for accommodation by ourselves hence we got in touch with other students who are already in India and we managed to come up with something.

03/09/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Sithabisiwe,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 08:10 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
03/09/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
03/09/23, 3:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Sithabisiwe 2K23JAN1904*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.


5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India
03/09/23, 3:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport.

I have a crucial update to share with all of you. As you may be aware, whenever one makes an International money transfer, there is an amount charged by the bank which is usually around 18%. Due to exchange in fluctuation, Ms. Eugene has received the less amount needed for your resrvation. 

In order to cover the difference, a payment of $35 is now required to successfully book your accommodation. For more details and instructions regarding this payment, please reach out to Ms. Eugene directly. She will provide you with all the necessary information.
