Therefore, could you kindly inform me of your expected timeframe for filling out these forms from your perspective?
02/11/23, 6:29 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Good day Ms Ashi, just to intervene on this one, currently Munashe is writing his A level final examinations, so i think he will be busy with revisions in preparation of the examinations, so that time frame of those forms to be sent tomorrow by 12:30pm i don't think he can make it, hence now he is on study which he will finish late and tomorrow morning he is writing an exam, so the time to go print the forms, i don't think he can make it by 12:30
02/11/23, 6:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with us, I can understand that Munashe is currently into his exams right now. However, it's essential to strike a balance between your his academic journey and exam preparations. Hence, parents can complete the forms on the student's behalf. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?
02/11/23, 6:38 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Yes we are, but hence as he (Munashe) said earlier on, right now am behind the steering, that why i said just to intervene, because i could see Munashe was nolonger available.
02/11/23, 6:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @27631040255 I totally understand that, with that in mind could you please share by when you will be able to complete the forms?
03/11/23, 11:31 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Munashe,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. In our conversation yesterday, we were in the midst of addressing crucial aspects related to your academic journey.

However, halfway through our discussion, we did not receive a response from your end, and consequently, I have been expecting a reply from you. Could you please confirm if you had the opportunity to go through my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
03/11/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 108 2926: Good morning  Ms Ashi
03/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 108 2926: I will try to print the forms  but l will not make it before 12:00pm
03/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 108 2926: Could you please borrow me some time , probably Tuesday l would have signed all the forms
03/11/23, 11:40 am - Ashi Edoofa: @263781082926 I can truly understand that you need more time to complete the forms, However I would like to know the reason why do you need additional 3 days to complete these forms?
03/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 108 2926: Im at a boarding school so l would need permission  from my senior teachers (pass) to go and print the forms
03/11/23, 11:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: @263781082926 I appreciate your efforts in sharing your concern, however considering that you need more time to complete the form I would like to encourage you that your parents can fill these forms on your behalf as with this approach we will complete the process in a timely manner. Could you please share your thoughts on this?
03/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 108 2926: It would be nice but my father is even more busy than me . But l will try to sign the forms soon
03/11/23, 12:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781082926 I can understand the situations with you, I really appreciate your dedication towards your journey. Could you please share if you can fill the forms by tomorrow ?
03/11/23, 12:17 pm - +263 78 108 2926: I will surely  make an effort to do so
03/11/23, 12:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the assurance dear, I hope you complete all the forms by tomorrow so that we can proceed ahead with your journey.

04/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Ok . But l just need to really understand here .. 
I pay it twice?
04/11/23, 1:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No @263781082926, The registration fees is only paid once when you will receive your offer letter.
04/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Here .. its written " Further more ,after you pay the *same* and.....",  thats where  l am asking that do l have to pay the registration fee and that one for Visa application  which is the same amount if its $800 it will make it $1600
04/11/23, 1:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright Munashe, Let me help you understand in the above message *Further more ,after you pay the same* here the same is referring to the previous amount. Please note that you only have to pay the registration fess of $500 to $1000 at once during your registration at the university. You are not required to pay this amount during your Visa process. I hope that's clear now.
04/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yeah  l understand now .. thank you
04/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear, Now, Let's start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*
04/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
04/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
04/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes lm ready
04/11/23, 1:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263781082926 , I am sharing the videos with you, and I am sure you must be excited for the videos.

04/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Ok
06/11/23, 12:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Munashe, Wishing you all a Wonderful Day!

I hope this message finds you well. As we move forward with your journey, I would like to follow up on the videos we shared with you. Can you please confirm if you have watched the videos?
If you have watched the videos, please share your understanding and insights with us.
06/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Good day to you all
06/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes l watched the videos  ..


From the first video,  l realised that there is a feeling of indipendence through the EWYL program.  Also Edoofa offers a life transforming education .. last but not least one has to follow instructions,  be teacheable and be open minded

Following the second video, Edoofa makes education affordable  .It increases the capacity of succes (an example of cup and tank water carrying capacity has been given) thus making a student more responsible .

On the third video,  Edoofa spent decades looking for good universities which  meet certain criterias .From these prestigious universities one boosts confidence and skills .. it has become the bed rock of edooda.

Lastly  , the SOP  creates a unique opportunity to convince ones worthy  for admission into a certain university  ...
06/11/23, 1:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Munashe, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
06/11/23, 1:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
06/11/23, 1:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
06/11/23, 1:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
06/11/23, 1:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
06/11/23, 1:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
06/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes , l was able to understand  through  the videos
06/11/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263781082926, we have successfully completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office). Therefore, we will now progress to the second step in her admission journey, which is the statement of purpose.

06/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
06/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Thank you Ms Ashi
06/11/23, 1:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
06/11/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
06/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Can it be tomorrow?
06/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263781082926, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms and documents. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day  and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
06/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 108 2926: I have no queries at the moment
06/11/23, 1:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear
06/11/23, 3:42 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Following, hope you all well
06/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am absolutely well @27631040255Thank you for asking.
07/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
07/11/23, 2:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
07/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes  we discussed
07/11/23, 2:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
07/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes Im following
07/11/23, 2:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
07/11/23, 2:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
07/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes l have noted it
07/11/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
07/11/23, 2:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
07/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 108 2926: So $1800 will be my annual fee after l did the registration
07/11/23, 2:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Munashe, For the first year your pending annual fees will be $1800 as your $1000 which you will paid for your registration will be adjusted in your tuition fees.
07/11/23, 2:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
07/11/23, 2:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
07/11/23, 2:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
07/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Noted  .
07/11/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Aditi  and she has scheduled my session for 14 Nov 2023 <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 108 2926: No queries at the moment
07/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Can we continue tomorrow  same time Ms Ashi , now l have to go to class
07/11/23, 2:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
07/11/23, 2:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, Please make sure to work on the documents and we will continue tomorrow at 1:00pm. Have a good day ahead!
08/11/23, 12:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Munashe, 

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
08/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Good afternoon to you too Ms Ashi
08/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 108 2926: We may proceed with our discussion
08/11/23, 1:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263781082926. Now, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
08/11/23, 1:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
08/11/23, 1:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
08/11/23, 1:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 1:38 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Afternoon  Ms Ashi, following, bear with me am always following late
08/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No issues @27631040255we understand that.
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781082926 Could you please share if you have taken a note of my above messages?
08/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Noted and following
08/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
08/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
08/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Inspiring  indeed
08/11/23, 1:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
08/11/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
08/11/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
08/11/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
08/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Lets  proceed and  discuss them
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Proceed  ma'am
08/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
08/11/23, 1:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
08/11/23, 1:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
08/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Its a great benefit ma'am  l agree
08/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
08/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
08/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
08/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Very much resonate
08/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $850.
08/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
08/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes ma'am  l understand
08/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
08/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
08/11/23, 2:06 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Awesome
08/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 108 2926: I have understood everything nicely
08/11/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263781082926 . Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
08/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Im not quite familiar with the process  . Please shade some light
08/11/23, 2:09 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Quite interesting
08/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
08/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
08/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
08/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
08/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 108 2926: I understand ma'am
08/11/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
08/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes I agree
08/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
08/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes , those will be the only options left to the student
08/11/23, 2:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
08/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Its clear Ms Ashi
08/11/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
08/11/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Again its clear
08/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,

28/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 108 2926: The admission fee is removed from the annual feee right ma'am?  Correct me if lm wrong
28/11/23, 2:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details, let me correct you here please that your annual fees is $2250. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 75% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
28/11/23, 2:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263781082926, you are absolutely right and we will discuss more about this soon.
28/11/23, 2:25 pm - +27 63 104 0255: 1.Tuition fee after scholarship annually  > $1000
2.Accomodation annually >  $0 on hostel 
4. Sports and Misc after scholarship > $ 0
5.Admission and processing fee to secure scholarship  >$1000
28/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Ok
28/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Another question ma'am,  " Is this the offer letter l am going to receive or l will receive more"?
28/11/23, 2:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781082926 Let me help you here, I would like to inform you that this is the first letter we have received, you might get more offer letters from other universities in the future.
28/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Ok ma'am  , l understand.  

So if l delay paying the admission fee waiting to check if l receive more offer letters so as to get a choice to choose the University of my choice ,will this one from MVN  University still be on offer and available
28/11/23, 2:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781082926 I would like to emphasize that we should concentrate on this offer letter now. However, I have taken a note of your concern and we will discuss about it later. I hope you understand.
28/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 108 2926: I understand
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the understanding @263781082926, As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $2250  (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $2500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
28/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes it does , but lm not seeing misc fee ma'am
28/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 108 2926: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you here dear, that the miscellaneous fees is the uniform fee mentioned in the row (I).
28/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
28/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 108 2926: I have gone through  the messages,  we can proceed
28/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 108 2926: I understand
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - +27 63 104 0255: I got lost here ma'am, how has the fees dropped annually from $2250  to $1250 as said
28/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 108 2926: So the remaining  fee after l paid admission  fee is it supposed to be paid whilst lm in my home country
28/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me it's an error from my side, and thank you for highlighting the same. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $2250.
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781082926 The majority of your concern will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look continue to our discussion?
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Thought the $1000 for admission is what you have subtracted hence he will be admitted from the first year
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes l can work with that
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2250, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
28/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes
28/11/23, 3:40 pm - +27 63 104 0255: My question on this is, how will me as a parent know of the credit earned by my child to reduce the fees, hence will be preparing to make the payments
28/11/23, 4:10 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Are we done with the discussion?
28/11/23, 4:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me I had a network issue that time. Let me assist you with your concern please that Munashe's mentor will share a record of his credits earned at the end of every month. She will guide you how you can redeem them. I hope with this you doubt is assisted?
28/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Ok
28/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Are we continuing?
28/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Because l have some questions
28/11/23, 4:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781082926 Once we complete our discussion about the offer letter, we will clear all your doubts.
28/11/23, 4:20 pm - +27 63 104 0255: And in this case hence the admission fee, is subtracted  from the annual fees, for 2024 will be paying $1500, then there after it will be $2250 annually, is this correct?
28/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, you are absolutely correct. However, we will discuss in more detail about this soon.
28/11/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2250 - $1000 = $1250, which will need to be paid by your parents.
28/11/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how Munashe can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
28/11/23, 4:26 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Noted
28/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes
28/11/23, 4:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
28/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Noted
28/11/23, 4:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $2500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $1500 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
28/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 108 2926: The total university fees for first year will be $1500, yes l get that . But in second year it will be $2500 is it?
28/11/23, 4:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263781082926, For first year your university fees will be $1500 after your registration fees. From the second year, your university fees will be 2250 per annum. I hope that's clear. <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 108 2926: It clear now
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $2500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $2500 - $1,000 = $1500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
28/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Its clear
28/11/23, 4:40 pm - +27 63 104 0255: On that one ma'am, does it have to be paid all at once, or i can make payment plans
28/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes , same question l had
28/11/23, 4:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as December 11th, 2023*.
28/11/23, 4:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
28/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Explain please
28/11/23, 4:55 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Yes go ahead ma'am
28/11/23, 4:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *December 11th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *January 11th 2024, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
28/11/23, 4:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Munashe's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before December 11th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
28/11/23, 4:57 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Clear ma'am
28/11/23, 4:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/11/23, 4:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/11/23, 5:03 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Am currently working and staying in South Africa
28/11/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/11/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/11/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/11/23, 5:14 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Still on the same note, can't i make a payment to an individual who is there in India, coz if am sending money from South Africa to  India, it's cheaper compared to sending to Zimbabwe
28/11/23, 5:15 pm - +27 63 104 0255: I will be sending through Mama Money transfers
28/11/23, 5:18 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Can u also clarify here ma'am
28/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27631040255 We have already shared a payment plan for the registration fees. May I know if you have taken a note of the same?
28/11/23, 5:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, In that case you can use Mama Money to pay Munashe's Registration fees.
28/11/23, 5:23 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Yes on the registration fee, i  have noted, am asking on the balance that's to be paid when the student arrives in India
28/11/23, 5:23 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Noted
28/11/23, 5:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Yes there is also a flexible payment plan which will be shared with you later.
28/11/23, 5:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
28/11/23, 5:31 pm - +27 63 104 0255: Everything understood, u can move on to University insights

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?
01/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes we did
01/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Ms Ashi can l personally tell you the University which l opt for and apply for me , if l may ask ?

01/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 108 2926: No  ma'am
01/12/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, As you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
01/12/23, 3:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781082926 May I please know dear if are still connected?
01/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes ma'am

01/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
01/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 108 2926: So if we fail to meet the deadline for the first payment , will the offer still be available
01/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, May I please know why you are asking this concern as I must believe your father is ready to make the payment?
01/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 108 2926: It was not really my choice
01/12/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know dear why you are not interested in MVN University?
01/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 108 2926: I dont mean to bluff but it did not  meet some of my criterias that l specifically prefer
01/12/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know, I respect your decision. In order to have a better understanding, Could you please share which criteria have you mentioned here?
01/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Im not saying its bad ma'am but when l researched about its ranking MVN was quite below
01/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 108 2926: I know in India there are numerous  universities but l wish it have  a little higher than that
01/12/23, 5:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not continuing our session due to network error. Thank you for expressing your concerns, I completely understand the importance of choosing the right university for your education, and I appreciate the effort you have put into researching MVN University.

Your commitment to ensuring a good university for yourself is commendable. Hence, I would like to address your concerns and offer some guidance. I am sure you must be aware that there are different ranking bodies in India and when you research university rankings and reviews, it's crucial to consider reliable sources such as official university websites, reputable education portals, and recognized ranking platforms. <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 5:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: While online reviews provide insights, they might not always represent the complete picture. University rankings can vary based on the criteria considered, and some universities might excel in specific departments or programs.

To provide you with accurate information, MVN University is one of the leading universities in the Delhi NCR, which is the capital of India, and was recommended for you after careful consideration. Hence, I am not sure about the places you have looked for, but if I am correct, it seems as if you were exploring the wrong place, and thus these concerns were highlighted. <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 5:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, being Indians, we are not only connected with Ministries in Zimbabwe but are also connected with the ones in India, and hence the university recommendations we get, are approved and directed from them. With this, you can rest assured that the quality of the university would be up to the mark and would be the right fit for Progress.
01/12/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 108 2926: I understand your board's concern.So  well ma'am  l checked out India's university ranking list and l found out that MVN University is at position 807 which  is not that bad but  l would  like to explore on other offer letters and check their ranking too
01/12/23, 5:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
01/12/23, 5:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
01/12/23, 5:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
01/12/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Im clear with what you have said admissionofficer
01/12/23, 5:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263781082926. As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 108 2926: No ma'am l wasn't aware of that
01/12/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN University by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.
01/12/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
01/12/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Ok ma'am  thank you for shading some light
01/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university.
01/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
01/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes ma'am
01/12/23, 6:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that Munashe, With this approach May I know if you have any doubt?
01/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 108 2926: None have arise so  far
01/12/23, 6:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively.

04/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Yes ma'am tuition fees as a whole during my whole  4 year stay in India
04/12/23, 7:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, dear you can pay your tuition fees on a monthly bases as well.

04/12/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Not at the moment

04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.

04/12/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 108 2926: Thank you
04/12/23, 8:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of December 11, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $425, or you can opt to pay the full $850 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
