Shall we move forward with our discussion?🛩️
18/10/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 519 4734: Good morning Ms Ananya,  yes we may move forward
18/10/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/10/23, 8:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Faith!

How are you doing?
19/10/23, 8:34 am - +263 77 519 4734: Morning Ms Ananya I'm sorry about yesterday I got busy at work before we complete our session
19/10/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 519 4734: Morning Ms Ananya I'm available
19/10/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 519 4734: May you share the 2 key objectives
19/10/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely!  Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/10/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/10/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 519 4734: That's great Ms Ananya now I understand
19/10/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
19/10/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 519 4734: It's so interesting and motivating Ms Ananya
19/10/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 519 4734: Thank you for sharing
19/10/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: You are most welcome, @263775194734 <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/10/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 519 4734: I'm pleased to meet you Head of Department Ms Sanjana and head coach Ms Davi, thank you
19/10/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Faith* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 519 4734: Noted Ms Ananya
19/10/23, 9:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: MENTOR - Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Faith* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
19/10/23, 9:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 9:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude our session here for today. We will connect tomorrow to move forward with our discussion. ✈️

How are you today? Shall we move forward with our discussion?🚀
20/10/23, 8:43 am - +263 77 519 4734: Good morning Ms Ananya yes we may continue
20/10/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Faith*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Faith* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
20/10/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 519 4734: Thank you for sharing such important goals
20/10/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Faith* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
20/10/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263775194734 

How are you doing today? Shall we move forward in your with our discussion?
23/10/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 519 4734: Morning Ms Ananya are you doing?
23/10/23, 8:41 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am doing well! Did you have the time to read the document?
23/10/23, 8:42 am - +263 77 519 4734: Yes Ms I tried to go through though I was suggesting to print it so it become a hard copy
23/10/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, that would be great!
23/10/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *NAME* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *faith* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
23/10/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 519 4734: Noted Ms
23/10/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday - 9:30 am to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
23/10/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
23/10/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
29/10/23, 3:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Faith!

I hope all is well with you. I noticed you didn't follow your EWYL Ritual of saying the proud Edoofian on your EWYL Line this time. Due to this, I couldn't share your weekly activity with you, and this might impact your performance in the EWYL program. Therefore, I'm reminding you to include the ritual in your message when you can. This way, I can share our weekly activity with you!
30/10/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, @263775194734 
May I ask if you have sent the mails?
