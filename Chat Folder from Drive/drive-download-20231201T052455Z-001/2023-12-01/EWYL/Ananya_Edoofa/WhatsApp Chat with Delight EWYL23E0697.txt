06/10/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
06/10/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 769 7756: let me download it. I had a network breakdown for a moment due to electricity faults

06/10/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Delight?
06/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 769 7756: I'm done reading, thank you for considering me for this scholarship.

11/10/23, 8:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Delight!

Excellent job on submitting the form! I've promptly shared it with our highly dedicated counseling team. It's essential that you keep up consistent communication with the student and promptly attend to any questions or concerns they might have. Your proactive engagement will ensure a smooth process.
11/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 769 7756: This message was deleted
11/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 769 7756: Morning how are you. I m personally doing very well. I would like to say thank you for so much for your support. I really appreciate it.
11/10/23, 1:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dear Delight,

Good afternoon. I trust you're doing well. In my ongoing efforts to enhance productivity and efficiency in preparation for your future education, I have devised a new timetable. This update includes a *change in the timing* of your EWYL sessions.

Starting today, our sessions are rescheduled to run from *1:30 PM to 2:30 PM.* I have faith that you'll be able to accommodate this new timing and join our sessions accordingly.
11/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 769 7756: Can we please make it after 2 pm. By that time frame I will be having lessons
11/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Delight, don't worry! Your fast-track process is about to finish. So today would be the last session for that.
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 769 7756: Ok thank you so much. I m now off from school maybe we can connect now if you are available
11/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Delight, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
11/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 769 7756: OK thank you so much. I just realised that you are forever the best and I have to do my best to be always honest with you
11/10/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday - 9:30 am to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/10/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
11/10/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
11/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 769 7756: M I allowed to ask because on the projects I only understood the one for Community building
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 769 7756: ok its fine. noted
11/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 769 7756: On some days our sessions will be disturbed since the ZIMSEC examination time table is out and I will be writing final exams from next week. *Some of my exams papers will be clashing with my Edoofa Sessions*
11/10/23, 4:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Delight! We will have a detailed discussion on your projects once you are done with your exams. Is that alright?
11/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 769 7756: OK that's great. Whenever I get new applications forms filled up, I share with you here or in your EWYL Inbox
11/10/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here, Delight!
11/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 769 7756: OK thank you so much
11/10/23, 4:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, to put your session on hold, as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my exams.

Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼
