You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?
15/08/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

I wanted to inform you that we won't be able to connect for our session today, as we are celebrating our *77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳

On this day, _India gained freedom from British colonial rule after nearly 200 years of struggle._ The celebrations are a reminder of the courage and determination of our ancestors, who worked tirelessly to secure our nation's sovereignty.🌟

So, if there is something you are facing challenges with, share it with me.

I hope you're doing well. I've noticed that you haven't been joining your EWYL sessions and calls for the past three weeks. We only meet once a week for just an hour, and it's alarming that you have not been serious about your commitments. It is crucial that you attend if you appreciate the opportunities you've been given.

I understand that juggling everything can be tough, but remember, stepping out of your comfort zone is essential for your path to success. If you're struggling with time management or facing challenges, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here to support you; all you need to do is share your concerns.
30/10/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Danzel!

If school-related issues are taking up a significant portion of your time, we can work on finding a balance that allows you to manage both your school and EWYL commitments effectively. Communication is key, so please keep me informed about your schedule and any potential clashes. We can explore ways to adapt and ensure you can still participate in EWYL while maintaining your school responsibilities.
06/11/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: *_Rescheduling the call_*

I know that we had a call scheduled for Saturday; however, due to bad health conditions, I couldn't schedule a call with you. Kindly excuse me for that. 

To make up for our missed call, I have scheduled a call with you today at 6:30 p.m.I hope to see you there!

About the $300 plan training
I am ready to start
25/11/23, 10:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Danzel!

I hope you are doing well. I am happy to see your dedication while completing your training. 

Let's connect at 6:00 p.m. on Monday. I understand that ideally, we wouldn't need this additional session, but I'm rearranging my schedule to ensure you can complete your $300 training and receive the student leader certificate from DSW.

This means a lot to me, and I believe in the impact it will have on your journey. So, don't miss this session, as it's our chance to make a significant stride forward together.

29/11/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Danzel!

I was hoping to hear from you at 6:00 PM Monday however you did not text me.
29/11/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since this means a lot to me, and I believe in the impact it will have on your journey, I am here sharing the grant document with you and something discussed during the training.

So, I would like you to read and provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. Only after this will you be provided with the "Certified Student Leader" certificate.

29/11/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: *1. Different channels for finding potential students*

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
29/11/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
29/11/23, 10:41 am - +91 92891 81723: Sorry ma'am I thought you were going to call
29/11/23, 10:42 am - +91 92891 81723: Okay I will do so 
thank you
