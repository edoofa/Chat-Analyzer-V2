13/09/23, 2:53 pm - +260 97 8023486: My long term goa is to ensure that I complete my senior academic year this November, 2023, and then pursue my Bachelors Degree.  With the knowledge that I will acquire from the University, will help me apply the acquired knowledge in my field of specialisation to achieve my goal. I also want to ensure that I complete my degree and be able to work in a high office providing tech support to a variety of clients. I therefore see my self using computer knowledge to venture into the filed of civil Engineering because things which one can do using a computer are almost limitless and possibilities are endless.
The EWYL program will help me acquire more knowledge in my course which will help earn more points.It will help lessen my parents burden of school fees payment. This will help me complete my course and will lead to better employment. EWYL will help me build on skills that will help me succeed into today's workplace. EWYL has alot of benefits.
13/09/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This is wonderful Kooji!
13/09/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, have you heard of the EWYL Program before? If so, can you provide me with some information about it?
So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
13/09/23, 3:52 pm - +260 97 8023486: Yes , I have heard of it through the counselling sessions with Mr.Shubham and shivjeet.
It's a scholarship program that focuses on student employment abilities through what I can call hands on learning. This program provides students with professional skills that are needed on their course of study. Students are helped pick up job skills that are needed in today's employment aspect. 
EWYL also helps offer students an opportunity to pay not more than $2000-$3000 per annum on their tution fees which helps reduce the financial burden of the students and the parents.
Through the use of hands on kind of learning in EWYL program,  this helps not to take skills that are too theoretical but ensures that they do the practical lesson skills as this helps in preparing students ahead of any challenges that may come their way,a thing which opens their way to more employment opportunities. Basically this helps students in earning scholarship credits and other opportunities that will prepare them for life after leaving University.
13/09/23, 3:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, that’s correct!

The EWYL (Earn While You Learn) Program aims to provide accessible, affordable, and employable higher education.

14/09/23, 2:55 pm - +260 97 8023486: Yes madam.

Q1. In the Edoofa program has three main projects that one has to complete before being admitted into the program. The following are the projects that are involved.
1. Corporate alliance 
2. Community building 
3. African schools education reform mission.

 Q2.
PROJECT 1
CORPORATE ALLIANCES
This is the first project one has to complete on their earn while you Learn program .Below I have outlined my understanding of this project and what I have gotten from the information sent .
The main aim of this program is to Create a network of partner companies and potential employees and create a professional network as well earn scholarship credits . In order to achieve this, one must have a certain skill set which involves the us of networking skills and websites such as LinkedIn. Through this they will build confidence, good communication skills and they will learn the use of google sheets. They must have a mindset for reaching out to potential influencers, must be able to face rejection and must have a never give up attitude.
The main aims for this project are to identify companies, identify the decision makers in the companies, reach out to individuals to share Edoofas  vision, arrange a time for meeting and facilitate for the signing of a contract.
The first step includes finding potential organisations online and doing research about them to know almost everything about the company's employees, and how much  they make per year.
The second thing is  finding out about the decision makers in the stated companies and reaching out to them and funding out the companies they work with on platforms like LinkedIn.
The third being the sharing of Edoofas messages  to the connections that you have made.
The fourth being the acceptance of a call, which must be at a suitable time and finally must facilitate for the signing of a final contract.
Lastly they must create a google sheet in order to record their progress as they reach out to different companies.
Once all of these steps and activities have been completed then the first project comes to an end and one has completed their fist EWYL project.

Q3.
PROJECT 2
COMMUNITY BUILDING 
This is the second project of the the EWYL program that one has to complete on their journey. In the paragraphs I have payed out my basic understanding of this project and  things needed to complete this project.
This project is a field of practise that is directed towards the creations or enhancement of the community among individual within a region or area with common interests and needs. 
The main outcomes of this project is to reach out and extend the networks and offer them a chance to be part of the Edoofas ecosystem. The main target group of this project are the youths who are motivated and have the zeal and drive to create a great career. They must have a skill set I'm order to complete this project with the best results. These skills include networking skills, persuasion skills and must be blue to leverage social media. Having the right mindset is also key in this project. And these influences finding opportunities with enthusiasm and sharing these opportunities with others to make an impact on their lives.
So in short the main aim of this project is to reach out to students in Africa who have just recently graduated within the last 6 months and refers them to the Edoofa program. And this is done by filling in an application form which has a list of all the youths in your community who must all be recent graduates. After this, one needs to also acquire business development skills in order to gain scholarship credit. 
With the completion of each task one will get different amounts of which all go towards their scholarship credits and reduce their financial costs.
Once this has been done then one has come to the end of the second project and has completed the part of the earn while you learn program.

Q4.
 PROJECT 3
AFRICAN SCHOOLS EDUCATION REFORM MISSION
This is the last and final project of the EWYL Project and seems like,the core part of the Edoofas program . The following are some of the things that I have understood from this project .
It's main aim is to reach out to local schools  in your local region or area and connect them to the decision makers at Edoofas. This program is mainly aimed at helping African schools to improve and is only for secondary school students. One must have the following skill set in order to complete this project the best way possible. These skills include networking skills, the use of professional platforms (LinkedIn), they must have confidence, good communication skills and must be able to use google sheets. All these skills would have been acquired by one through the first two projects in the EWYL program. As mentioned In the other two projects, mindset is key in completing each task. Theses includes reaching out to people who are influential, being able to face rejections, must have a never give up attitude and most importantly they must also be able to give back to the community.
To do this project one has to make a list of all the schools in the area their school being the first on the list. They must also identify them through their LinkedIn accounts if they have any. Next is to reach out to them. It is important to also keep track of all your progress on google sheets. 
As this is done ,one will receive different amounts on different tasks being completed. Once this is done then one has come to the end of this part of the EWYL Program.

15/09/23, 11:25 am - +260 97 8023486: My brief understanding of the video is that it  explains the projects beginning with the 
1. Corporate Alliance  project  whose objective is to ensure that students gain an understanding of the market one plans to enter in future in order to begin preparing for it at an earlier stage. Due to the global pandemic experienced and the shift to online work,there is a great opportunity for one to connect with technology driven and digital companies.The task is now for one to identify such companies in ones  region or country. This can only be achieved by identifying the region network in my country, family members or even parents to my friends  who actually work in the same sector. Sharing of the objective and how Edoofa Is helping in developing necessary skills for future employability is one important aspect as well.The video as well recommends creating LinkedIn account which is a professional working platform which allows one to search for companies.  The video recommends as well that one should download the link from app store of which a quide on how to go about this will be given. Through the LinkedIn one will be able to reach out to managers of organisations and HRMOs who will be initiating meetings which should be communicated to Edoofa as well.Discussions to be shared as well with Edoofa as part of the program.It also includes information on the companies to target as well.

18/09/23, 2:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Kooji!
18/09/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

18/09/23, 4:16 pm - +260 97 8023486: *PROJECT 2: COMMUNITY BUILDING.* 
Having listened to the audio, my understanding is that the video explains that all those that are Edoofians have the ability to build the community. It explains further the meaning of the term community which has been explained as the" process of establishing and strengthening connections, relationships and shared identity among individuals within a particular group or community" This creates  aspects of inclusiveness, involvement where individuals will have to fill a sense of belonging and be able to collaborate, communicate by working towards the common goal. It actually aims at fostering a positive and cohesive community that fosters and promotes social interaction, participation in a more shared sense of responsibility and ownership which is aimed at achieving collective success. 
In this view, the shared goal is actually second goal belief which is community building whose primary aim is  for students to developing networking and participation skills and also learn how to go about social media in order to offer African students an apportunity to join the Edoofian education ecosystem and acquire international education  which  will prepare them for the future by actually reaching personal and extended networks.
Students will as well  be able to identify motivated youths who for career creation.
This project  as well encourages students to develop a mind set of identifying opportunities and share them openly so as to create an impact in the lives of others.
In order to successfully complete this project, students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools, completed their Secondary Education or are currently in their final year of their Senior Secondary school education.
As members of the team Edoofa, students are expected to use their networking persuasion skills to refer to the organisation in order to help the organisation more by creating an impact in the life of others.
To successfully complete this project,  students are required to reach out to African students  who have completed the senior education.
Through out the project,Edoofa will actually provide guidance and support in order to ensure that the students are successful in all their efforts.
This will therefore provide students an opportunity to earn scholarship credits through Edoofa program.
For every student that enrolls and pays the first part of the enrollment fee which every student will receive $20 worth of scholarship credit. Upon completion of the formalities of their university,  the student will receive $30 worth of scholarship credits. In  addition, the student will have an opportunity to earn an extra $5 worth scholarship credits. For every student Edoofa connects with.
18/09/23, 8:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: That’s awesome- Kooji, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
18/09/23, 8:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project. Are you ready?
18/09/23, 8:27 pm - +260 97 8023486: Yes I'm ready

Here is the message -
18/09/23, 8:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe.
 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

- As part of the project, the student will have to reach out to schools in their local area to inform the Headteachers about the Edoofa programs 
Thereafter,make a lost of schools  preferably secondary schools in my local area. Importantly  beginning with my own school by connecting with the school director telling them reasons why I have joined the Edoofa scholarship. 
I have have to tell them how I have planned about my future and then share the program with them. After that   I have to ask them of at all I can set up an online program with them with the Edoofa director where both can exploration.  After this then share the contact details of the principal with the EWYL mentor.  The format will bee provided. Further more and very important is the aspect of reaching out to schools to arrange meetings with the school Headteachers and the Edoofa program director.

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?

Q2. Name of the Province where your school is located.
18/09/23, 9:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Are you following it Kooji?*
18/09/23, 9:21 pm - +260 97 8023486: I'm following
18/09/23, 9:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the *School is not connected* with Edoofa:
18/09/23, 9:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
18/09/23, 9:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the *School is connected* with Edoofa:
18/09/23, 9:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
18/09/23, 9:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
18/09/23, 9:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Is everything clear until now Kooji*

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, "I am a proud Edoofian.

Since we discussed that we share wednesday Lesson on wednesday. 
I am waiting to share the same with you. 
But our chat has been locked since you did not follow the ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian'.

Kindly follow your EWYL ritual on he EWYL Line so that I can share the wednesday lesson.
20/09/23, 10:28 am - +260 97 8023486: Duly noted madam
20/09/23, 10:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: Kooji ,
This is a gentle reminder that you have still not written *I am a proud Edoofian'* on the *EWYL Line*.
I am waiting for your text.
20/09/23, 11:17 am - +260 97 8023486: I have already the message twice on the platform
20/09/23, 11:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes Kooji Noted.
I am extremely thrilled to welcome you on the EWYL Line
I have shared the today's Wednesday Lesson on the EWYL Line. Kindly go through it and share your understanding of the same before our next session.
20/09/23, 6:16 pm - +260 97 8023486: My understanding of the audio shared on EWYL line is that:
It talks about skills, lessons and experiences that will actually make the Edoofians become more creative and be able to discover themselves.This will then help them develop skills which will aid them in their journey of becoming successful professionals.
The main topic that was under discussion was freelancing which is a dynamic and flexible career path in which people can work on contract and after their services to the clients or companies on project by project basis without really entering into long term employment contract. This is something which is contrary to the tradition approach of employment because students are seen to be working independently in a form of self employed arrangements.
The lesson will teach about instructions and the benefits a student can have through. So the video simply explains on the benefits of the students when the venture into it.
21/09/23, 10:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Kooji
I hope you are doing well

Thank you so much for submitting your understanding of the wednesday Lesson.
I am waiting for you to come online in the EWYL Line

25/09/23, 9:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am waiting to start our schedules session today.
25/09/23, 11:36 am - +260 97 8023486: Greetings, I have already done so on EWYL line.
26/09/23, 8:26 am - +260 97 8023486: Hello Madam Sharda,
Hope this finds you well,  I would like to take sometime to explain some of the skills that i possess that give an advantage over others involved in the same program. For starters my interests mainly lie in the programming field, though I have just learned the basics of programming activities. I am still expanding my horizon and as of now I am currently teaching myself some skills due to the lack of a teacher and also the subjects I am involved in at school.I have managed this through my skill of learning skills quickly and finding creative ways to solve problems and apply them to other. I am a very quick leaner and I grasp concepts very quickly. The skills I learn in one field I can use to solve problems in other field in a creative way. For example,if I was to learn something in graphic designs, I would use those skills in other fields like software programming.In particular when I start my course, my main interests are In software programming, cyber security, and graphics designs  and game designs in the programming field. I am self motivated and in terms of mathematics and computing skills I am fairly good, and I have great problem solving skills. 
Not only this but my communication skills are fairly good and my attention to details is good , and I like to keep my things organised and clean.  In terms of my social skills, I am fairly adequate and I am able to interact with most people in different social groups, and  get along with most people due to being in contact with people from different backgrounds. In terms of my writing skills, I would say that I am a pretty adequate writer and have some skills here and there as seen through this masterpiece:).
Thank you for your time,your consideration in this matter will be greatly appreciated as these opportunities do not come very often in ones life so when they do one must make the most of them. Thank you.
26/09/23, 8:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Kooji
I hope you are doing well.

Thank you so much for submitting your response.
26/09/23, 8:45 am - +260 97 8023486: My pleasure Ms.sharda
28/09/23, 9:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning Kooji
I hope you are doing well

Kindly come to the EWYL line for your scheduled session and follow your EWYL ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian'.
28/09/23, 9:46 am - +260 97 8023486: Good morning Ms.Sharda. Noted
29/09/23, 11:02 am - +260 97 8023486: My response to the news letter is that the founder of Edoofa is appreciating the comments students share in the news letter with their mentors on how they intend to transform the society.
It further contains wise quotes which are shared with students and this helps in transforming the mind set of the students in order to remain focused and committed to their programs for better success despite the many challenges that may come their way.These challenges may be encountered due to many choices that come there way.
The wise sayings contained in the news letter are of much greater help to the students. They are encouraged further to ensure that they become more happy with what they already have because happy people always engage in staticifying  all the time. This is considered to be one of the pillars.
Generally, the news letter is a very inspirational piece of message to all the students to remain focused and be better people in the communities and work places where they will be offering services.
29/09/23, 11:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Kooji

05/10/23, 10:57 pm - +260 97 8023486: LESSON SHARED
My understanding is that as people, we experience our first sense of belonging at home with our immediate families.As we grow older as individuals, our search for belongingness in
 other areas now begin to increase. 
It is therefore important to a have a better understanding of belonging to the Edoofian community because everyone in the Edoofian community is a very important person as this is essential for every success in ones journey because it provides important aspects such as motivation  support,knowledge, networking, accountability,emotional well being and above all the opportunity to leave a lasting impact, things which help an individual to succeed. 
The above aspects are important for success because they make an individual develope the feeling of belonging to a family greater than oneself through networking opportunities.
Belongingness is some thing that is offered by Edoofa an indication that students are not alone on this journey of developing youthful skills that help lead them on the journey of becoming successful professionals. This is effectively done with the help of the mentors. 
Therefore, in conclusion, the news letters shared by Edoofa are of greater importance because they provide students with reach content of information on what is expected of them as they journey through university process.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
