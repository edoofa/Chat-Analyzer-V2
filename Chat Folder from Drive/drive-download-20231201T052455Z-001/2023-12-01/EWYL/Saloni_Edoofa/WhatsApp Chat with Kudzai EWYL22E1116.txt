16/09/23, 10:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Saturday* from *08:00 AM - 09:30 AM* from next week onwards⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 355 1079: Noted with thanks ma'am
16/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 355 1079: Its just that we are experiencing bad network but on Saturday iam available
21/09/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day! I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that due to the _organization being closed this Saturday_, our next session will be rescheduled to the following week, specifically on *Wednesday, September 27, 2023* _12:00-01:00 PM_. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

27/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 355 1079: Greetings Ms Saloni Rastogi
Im kindly asking for a session on Saturday because during the week i will be at work. 
Sorry for the inconveniences
27/09/23, 12:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that you and your parents may have commitments here at the school, but it's important to recognize that you've come a long way already. You've successfully completed the counseling process and paid your enrollment fees, showing your dedication to this journey. Just as we follow a fixed timetable for classes and office hours, we have a similar schedule for these essential sessions.
27/09/23, 12:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I want to assure you that I value your time. On my end, I've streamlined the process to just a few days, and in some cases, it can even be completed in a single day. Your participation is crucial, and I kindly ask for your cooperation in acknowledging and attending these sessions. It's a small investment of time for the long-term benefit of your education and future success.
27/09/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 355 1079: Well noted ma'am
27/09/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 355 1079: We may proceed with the session  but i might be responding a bit late due to pressure at work
27/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, I understand.
27/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: But let me also shift your session on Saturday so that you can attend it.

30/09/23, 8:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
30/09/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 355 1079: Greetings ma'am 
Yes let's start
30/09/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Kudzai will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

How are you?

May we begin with our session?
07/10/23, 8:05 am - +263 77 355 1079: Morning Ms Saloni
07/10/23, 8:05 am - +263 77 355 1079: Yes ma'am
07/10/23, 8:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Kudzai can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 8:14 am - +263 77 355 1079: Ok
07/10/23, 8:15 am - +263 77 355 1079: Yes we are on the same page ma'am
07/10/23, 8:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
07/10/23, 8:18 am - +263 77 355 1079: Noted ma'am
07/10/23, 8:19 am - +263 77 355 1079: For now Kudzai is at school and he will be starting his exams next week
07/10/23, 8:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Kudzai takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Kudzai is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
07/10/23, 8:26 am - +263 77 355 1079: Its ok ma'am
07/10/23, 8:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

the work that you do.
 I should arrange for a call/video call meeting between Edoofa and these
Organizations and then Finally facilitating the signing of Contract

29/11/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 977 5226: As far as I understood..I should search for companies and find companies that match my criteria then secondly I should get information on those companies for example how they operate and then I have to study the website of those specific companies and then I should check the various social media platforms of the company ,then after that I have to study the background of the founder and other core members then lastly I should reach out to those members by dropping for example an invitation note
