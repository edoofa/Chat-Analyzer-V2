15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Thus fine sir
15/09/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Sorry ms Saloni I.had said sir
19/09/23, 12:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
19/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 714 8442: Very well and you  ,yes let's begin
19/09/23, 12:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how NAME can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
19/09/23, 12:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 371 3750: Yes we are
19/09/23, 12:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So now we are ready to start a new journey🎉
19/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
19/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
19/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
19/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
19/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
19/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
19/09/23, 12:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

19/09/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 371 3750: I'm worried of going astray and make uninformed decision for my child
19/09/23, 1:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We're excited to welcome your child to this enriching academic journey, and we want to ensure a smooth experience for everyone involved. To kickstart this process and keep you informed every step of the way, we kindly request your cooperation in completing a few basic formalities.
