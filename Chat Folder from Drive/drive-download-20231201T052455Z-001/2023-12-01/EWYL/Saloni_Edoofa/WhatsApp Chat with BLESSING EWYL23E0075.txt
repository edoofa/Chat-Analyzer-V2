I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Monday and Thursday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 5:57 pm - +263 71 590 5125: Greetings Ms Salon. 

Please note the student is at school right now until 30 November 2023. I can do the required sessions on behalf of the student. The scheduled days and time sounds good to me. Many thanks
16/09/23, 10:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I acknowledge that you as parents can attend the session.
21/09/23, 12:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

Let's begin with our session🌈
21/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 590 5125: Good day I am good thank you. My apologies I was caught up in a meeting and I didn't have my phone with me
25/09/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How did your weekend go?
This is just a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening on *MONDAY and THURSDAY* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳ this week.
_Please make sure that either you or your parents are present in the session_🚨
25/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 590 5125: Greetings Ms Saloni. I was looking foward to your message between  12:30 and 12:45 when I saw you not online I thought we were  not having our session today
25/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 590 5125: Noted with thanks
26/09/23, 10:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Blessing and parent!

We were having our session and I had a student's case that required my immediate attention. Please excuse me if it caused any inconveniences.
27/09/23, 8:36 am - +263 71 590 5125: Greetings Ms Saloni hope you are doing great, thank you.

Kindly advise on when are we resuming our sessions hopefully maintaining the same time previously scheduled time
28/09/23, 10:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Blessing and parents!
How are you?

As discussed and notified earlier, our scheduled session will be happening on *MONDAY and THURSDAY* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳ this week.
28/09/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
28/09/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 590 5125: Good day ma'am, my apologies my work schedule overlapped, if its OK with you we may proceed
28/09/23, 1:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, let us proceed.
28/09/23, 1:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
28/09/23, 1:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
28/09/23, 1:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
28/09/23, 1:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
28/09/23, 1:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

28/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 590 5125: Thank you for the above information, I suggest we put this on hold and allow the student to take part in the sessions when she has finished her exams on 1 December 2023. I feel she has to be able to do  these sessions on her own with our assistance for a better understanding and also for her to enjoy the journey of how to become a Proud Edoofian. Also as I sometimes get busy with work schedules I may fail to be on the platform everyday which may put her at a disadvantage of acting as if she is someone not committed, yet it might not be fault but the parent working on behalf of her.
28/09/23, 8:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before she takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before she herself is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
03/10/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing!

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

18/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 71 590 5125: Good evening Ms Saloni.
Thank you for the Newsletter. I enjoyed reading the newsletter it's quite motivational. I liked the part which says "it's not what about what you do best but being able to taking risks". This has helped me to think outside the box when planning about my life that is not only to focus on my desires but must go an extra mile of trying different options. That means sometimes you have to take risk in life for you to move on to another level.
19/10/23, 9:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I wholeheartedly thank you for investing your valuable time in perusing our newsletter. Just as you've shown your support, we are committed to continuously delivering extraordinary newsletters from our side. Your engagement and enthusiasm are truly inspiring!
