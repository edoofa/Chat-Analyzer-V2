16/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Tanatswa!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 10:24 am - +263 78 902 9727: Good morning
We will take the second option <This message was edited>
16/09/23, 10:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, you would be opting for a session on Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.?
16/09/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 902 9727: Yes
16/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 288 6038: Well she will take the second option.
16/09/23, 12:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, thank you.
Have a good day.
25/09/23, 10:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

I apologize for being unable to take your Saturday session because the organization was closed. Your understanding is greatly appreciated.
30/09/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
30/09/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 902 9727: Good morning, we are having connectivity issues
30/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 902 9727: So I will face a lot of challenges with consistency throughout the session 
My sincere apologies
30/09/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand but let's do our best to work through the connection problems and make the most of our time together.
30/09/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Tanatswa! I'm thrilled to catch up with you and get all the details about your current project progress and the amazing ways you've been upskilling yourself. So, let's dive right in and share the incredible journey you've been on!
30/09/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 902 9727: I am also very excited to get in touch again but as my parents and I have mentioned earlier, we had put the EWYL program on hold because of school and we informed the EDOOFA family via email
30/09/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 902 9727: So I haven't started the ewyl projects
30/09/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I get it. I was of the notion it was Tanatswa's phone number.
30/09/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Tanatswa* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
30/09/23, 9:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/09/23, 10:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, this concludes our session for today but I expect you to be more active in your sessions.

07/10/23, 1:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Tanatswa, okay I understand please share your schedule with me so that I can align our timings so that you do not miss out on these sessions.
07/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Good Afternoon, The next 5 weeks I'm not going to be available, even on weekends because I have started examinations.
On weekends I will be having much needed revision sessions

No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 2:00, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
30/11/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 902 9727: Noted

30/11/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Can you share what you've retained till now from your EWYL Sessions so that we can resume from that point?
30/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Yesterday you shared this document with me and asked that I go through it and give a brief of the document, so in essence I understood that the document outlines the activities for the EWYL program as well as the skills attained and the scholarship   credits received for each completed task
30/11/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
30/11/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
30/11/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Noted
30/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 902 9727: I have gone through the audio twice
30/11/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
30/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 902 9727: The audio explains the document to be specific Cooperate Alliance
The Edoofian is expected to identify technologically driven companies in their region and share and market  Edoofas vision
The Edoofian also has to create a linked in account and get in touch with managers and shareholders and set up a meeting for the company of choice and Edoofa
30/11/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
30/11/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
30/11/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
30/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 902 9727: The document is a guide for searching for companies that would best suit the ideal companies Edoofa wants to target, nature, scale and founding details come into play
The document also gives examples of such ideal student centric companies 
Furthermore the document explains ways to get in touch with such companies be through their social media or company apps
30/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 902 9727: Before we continue I have a question
30/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 902 9727: The document mentions different companies from different countries but the earlier document had said the companies which we are to get in tough with have to be local
So to make the task clearer is it possible that you give examples of companies that meet your required criteria that are Zimbabwean <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic! <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
