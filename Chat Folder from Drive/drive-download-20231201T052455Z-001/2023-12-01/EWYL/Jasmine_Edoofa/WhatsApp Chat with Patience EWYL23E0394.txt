31/08/23, 12:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
I hope you are doing well. Yes, I have removed him.
08/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
15/09/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

25/09/23, 12:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon!*
I hope you had a wonderful weekend and are ready to kickstart a productive week ahead! 🌞 _*I would like to remind you that we have our session scheduled for today from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM.*_

I'm looking forward to our discussion and making this Monday a great start to your week. Make sure that you are on time
25/09/23, 12:47 pm - +260 96 7808874: Noted.
25/09/23, 2:02 pm - +260 96 7808874: Just to try, one of them is to make sure the student is able to earn some credits for her tuition fees while learning.
25/09/23, 2:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Patience is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals. <This message was edited>
25/09/23, 2:09 pm - +260 96 7808874: I have understood fully now. Thanks.
25/09/23, 2:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
25/09/23, 2:12 pm - +260 96 7808874: Well noted.
25/09/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.

Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
25/09/23, 2:16 pm - +260 96 7808874: Noted.
25/09/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your eff
25/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 96 7808874: Alright.
25/09/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. Have a great day ahead!
25/09/23, 2:42 pm - +260 96 7808874: Thank you same to you.
26/09/23, 1:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Greetings, 
We are about to start our session in the next 5 minutes. 
*So are you ready?*
26/09/23, 1:31 pm - +260 96 7808874: Yes. Thank you.
26/09/23, 1:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So today I will be telling you about the Program Structure
26/09/23, 1:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Faith to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
26/09/23, 1:52 pm - +260 96 7808874: Noted. But how do we proceed with this program since the student herself won't be available for those sessions due to limited access to the internet? Or we are allowed to do it on her behalf before she is done with her exams on 16th November 2023
26/09/23, 1:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, This structure will be followed once she is back from the exams.
26/09/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
26/09/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 2:17 pm - +260 96 7808874: Well noted.
26/09/23, 2:17 pm - +260 96 7808874: Very inspiring. I have benefited also.
26/09/23, 2:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Patience can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
26/09/23, 2:28 pm - +260 96 7808874: We are together.
26/09/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if Patience is available. If yes then I can have a session with her 2 times a week. 

If she is not available then I would suggest you put the program on Hold and resume when she comes back. <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 2:44 pm - +260 96 7808874: She is not available for now until November 16.
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Then I am sharing the EWYL LINE number with you.
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Save this number and our sessions will be conducted on the Line only
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
26/09/23, 3:01 pm - +260 96 7808874: Noted and saved the number.
26/09/23, 3:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to draft a mail on behalf of Patience to me stating that:

29/09/23, 2:08 pm - +260 96 7808874: Ok. So we are going ahead even in her absence?
29/09/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No No
29/09/23, 2:10 pm - +260 96 7808874: Alright.

Today, I'd like to share some insights about *Dussehra, a festival observed in India on the 24th of October* Dussehra marks the triumph of Lord Rama, an embodiment of the deity Vishnu, over the demon king Ravana. As per the epic Ramayana, Ravana had kidnapped Lord Rama's wife, Sita. This festival signifies the victory of righteousness (Rama) over malevolence (Ravana). Allow me to describe how I personally celebrated Dussehra.
