18/08/23, 2:32 pm - +260 97 8133366: Thank you for the knowledge empowerment
18/08/23, 3:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
18/08/23, 3:49 pm - +260 97 8133366: Studying abroad will give me a higher chance of achieving my goals seeing as your country is more advanced in the technological field
18/08/23, 3:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
18/08/23, 4:01 pm - +260 97 8133366: Not yet...most of them are post results... And I can only be able to apply once I've written my exam
18/08/23, 4:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great So as you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
18/08/23, 4:16 pm - +260 97 8133366: I have no idea
18/08/23, 4:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
18/08/23, 4:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
18/08/23, 4:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
18/08/23, 4:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 4:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
18/08/23, 4:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Before moving on ahead, Do you have any questions regarding the information shared with you so far?
18/08/23, 4:47 pm - +260 97 8133366: There are no questions so far
18/08/23, 4:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

26/08/23, 8:20 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Ms Chewe @260977762453, How are you?
26/08/23, 8:21 am - +260 97 8133366: @260977762453 is not around for today... But she left me with a few questions to ask you
26/08/23, 8:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please ask Faith!
26/08/23, 8:26 am - +260 97 8133366: 1. The $350 is only to be paid this one time right❓
26/08/23, 8:27 am - +260 97 8133366: 2. How is the EWYL program considering I'm a boarder and I'll be opening school on the 4th September ❓
26/08/23, 8:28 am - +260 97 8133366: 3. The payment of the $350 should be done using "Axis" bank❓
26/08/23, 8:29 am - +260 97 8133366: 4. Assuming she does get accepted completely... Once she leaves next year... When does she come back to Zambia ❓
26/08/23, 8:30 am - +260 97 8133366: 5. Assuming she does get accepted... Who pays for the plan ticket ❓
26/08/23, 8:30 am - +260 97 8133366: Those are the only questions she left me with... But I do have one of my own
26/08/23, 8:34 am - +260 97 8133366: Assuming I do get accepted... Are the next steps able to be done without me❓... Because I'll be going back to school soon
26/08/23, 8:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: 1. Yes please, The Enrollment fees is a one time fee.
26/08/23, 8:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: 2. Please in that case you will be continuing your session whenever you get back from school after the 4th of September. You will just need to update your EWYL mentor about the specific timelines on when you will join and your EWYL projects will then commences or continue accordingly.
26/08/23, 8:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: 4. Please she can visit back during the vacation period. Every year there are two vactaions time during the summers or winter breaks
26/08/23, 8:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: 5. If you understand the concept of international education that finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
26/08/23, 8:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
26/08/23, 8:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, this means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
26/08/23, 8:40 am - Shubham Madhwal: As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also acquire the visa with ease.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $400-$600, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preperations
26/08/23, 8:41 am - Shubham Madhwal: 3. Please you can pay it directly to axis bank or if you have seen in pg-4 of the letter you can also pay through our associates of Zambia, Penmal Connect for easy transactiions
26/08/23, 8:42 am - Shubham Madhwal: I even shared there contact details with you earlier. So you can follow the procedure ahead easily.
