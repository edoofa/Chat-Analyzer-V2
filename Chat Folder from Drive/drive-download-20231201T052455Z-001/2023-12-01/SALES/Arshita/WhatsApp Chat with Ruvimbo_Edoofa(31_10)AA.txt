31/10/23, 12:29 pm - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
31/10/23, 12:29 pm - Arshita: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 
Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 


The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2500+ Zimbabwean who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

31/10/23, 4:17 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
31/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 973 1169: Waiting for this message
31/10/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/10/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
31/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 973 1169: Yes
31/10/23, 4:22 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
31/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 973 1169: How is it done?
31/10/23, 4:24 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
31/10/23, 4:24 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
31/10/23, 4:24 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
31/10/23, 4:24 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
31/10/23, 4:24 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
31/10/23, 4:24 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

31/10/23, 4:24 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
31/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 973 1169: Well, I have to say that I agree with your assessment of the benefits of studying law in India. The cultural and personal benefits would be incredibly valuable, and I think the "Earn While You Learn" program would be a great way to gain practical experience while studying. I think that it's a great opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience and apply the theory they learn in the classroom to real-world situations.
31/10/23, 4:30 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
31/10/23, 4:30 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 5:26 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *12:30 am CAT on Wednesday(01/11/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

01/11/23, 4:42 pm - Arshita: *1.

Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
01/11/23, 4:42 pm - Arshita: *2.

Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
01/11/23, 4:42 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
01/11/23, 4:42 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
01/11/23, 4:42 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,

03/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 973 1169: Yes i have and the earnings are okay
03/11/23, 3:43 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
03/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 973 1169: My father
03/11/23, 3:49 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with him after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
03/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 973 1169: They're totally okay with me studying abroad
03/11/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
03/11/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
03/11/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?

10/11/23, 3:11 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
10/11/23, 3:11 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
10/11/23, 3:11 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
10/11/23, 3:11 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
10/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 973 1169: Yes please
10/11/23, 3:16 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
10/11/23, 3:16 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
10/11/23, 3:30 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
10/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 973 1169: Not yet

How are you doing?
16/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 973 1169: I'm doing okay thanks
16/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 973 1169: Yourself?
16/11/23, 1:11 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you!
16/11/23, 1:11 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 973 1169: yes I did go through it
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
16/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 973 1169: noted
16/11/23, 1:22 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
16/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 973 1169: 5
16/11/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: No we have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
16/11/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
16/11/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
16/11/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
16/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 973 1169: yes you've made things clear
16/11/23, 7:24 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

17/11/23, 1:19 pm - Austin#276: It is good to connect with you today, Mrs Dengwani 

I hope you are doing well
17/11/23, 1:19 pm - Austin#276: I am doing well, thanks for asking
17/11/23, 1:19 pm - Austin#276: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
17/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 71 973 1169: From what I've heard so far, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a great opportunity for students who are interested in studying in India like me . I love that it's affordable and that it emphasizes cultural harmony and inclusiveness. However, I have a few questions about the details of the program.  What kind of criteria do you use to select recipients? Do you prioritize academic merit, financial need, or other factors?
17/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 71 973 1169: I've got a few more thoughts about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. First, I'm curious about the living conditions and support services available to students who receive the scholarship. Do they have access to housing, food, and other necessities?   I'm also wondering about safety - what kind of measures are in place to ensure that students are safe and secure while studying in India?
17/11/23, 8:43 pm - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 10:53 am - Austin#276: Good Morning to you all!
How are you today?
18/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 973 1169: We are doing just fine thanks
18/11/23, 10:59 am - Austin#276: Good to hear from you, Ruvimbo!
18/11/23, 11:04 am - Austin#276: The eligibility procedures are the criteria or set of evaluations that you need to get through inorder to be eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.They include-
-Scholarship Test(Online/Offline)

Your Academics, understanding of the program, willingness to be a part of the Edoofa family, personal traits, qualities, previous experiences, career aspirations etc would be evaluated!
18/11/23, 11:04 am - Austin#276: There are two options for Accommodation from which you are free to choose. 

1) Campus Accommodation- Students live in hostels inside the University premises.You are free to choose the type of hostel rooms and the seaters. There are single seaters, two seaters and more. 

2) Outside Campus-Accommodation is arranged in apartments outside the University campus.It is close to Universities and cheaper than in campus

After the University Sessions you will be given these options and can choose from them
18/11/23, 11:05 am - Austin#276: Students have various food options such as Kiosks, Campus canteen, Monthly packages, tiffin services and can even cook by themselves
18/11/23, 11:06 am - Austin#276: The question regarding your welfare and personal development is absolutely understandable. 

Just to give a glimpse, with a community of more than 2000 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14 years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout the duration of their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While you Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your family will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

18/11/23, 11:24 am - Austin#276: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 11:24 am - Austin#276: Have I addressed your questions, Ruvimbo?
18/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 973 1169: What does the Scholarship test compose of?
18/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 973 1169: yes you have .
18/11/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 973 1169: What happens if one fails the Scholarship Test?
18/11/23, 11:27 am - Austin#276: It includes Basic Mathematics, English Comprehension and Grammar and Essays
18/11/23, 11:27 am - Austin#276: Good to know!
18/11/23, 11:27 am - Austin#276: The applicant will be disqualified from the program
18/11/23, 11:28 am - Austin#276: At the same time, if the aggregate score of the test and Interview is still satisfactory, they have a chance to proceed
18/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 973 1169: what marks does one have to score so as to avoid being disqualified?
18/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 973 1169: oh okay
18/11/23, 11:32 am - +263 71 973 1169: Wow, it's great that students have the option to choose between on-campus and off-campus housing! Living in a university dorm can be a great way to make friends and get involved in campus life, while living off-campus can be a more independent experience and a great way to explore the local area.
18/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 973 1169: That's really interesting and gives students a chance to make up for lower scores in one area with stronger scores in another.
18/11/23, 11:44 am - Austin#276: They need to have at least 60% score on the scholarship test and the final evaluation will be the interview with the Program Director?
18/11/23, 11:44 am - Austin#276: Indeed, Ruvimbo!
18/11/23, 11:45 am - Austin#276: Absolutely, what else would you like to ask me ask me please?

18/11/23, 1:51 pm - Austin#276: When are you planning to discuss the same?

23/11/23, 8:13 pm - Austin#276: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
23/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 973 1169: To summarize:

1. I will be studying through the Edoofa Program in the Bachelors of Law program.

2. As per the information I have been provided with, I will be studying in lndia through the Edoofa program.

3. The average cost of studies in India without a scholarship is around 400-650 USD per year.

4. I will have to pay an annual fee of 8,500 USD per year, after the scholarship adjustment.

5.The enrollment fee for the Edoofa Program is $150 USD, and it is payable within 7 days of receiving your offer letter from the university. This fee is non-refundable, and it is used to cover the administrative costs of processing your application and registering you as a student. It is important to note that this fee is separate from the tuition fee, and it must be paid before your enrollment can be confirmed. 

6.Sure, let me elaborate on my understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words:

The Earn While You Learn program is an exciting opportunity for students to earn and learn simultaneously. It is a program that offers students the opportunity to gain work experience in their field of study while they are still pursuing their degree. The program allows students to work in a related industry, and earn a salary while they complete their studies. The goal of the program is to give students a head start in their career, and to give them the experience and skills they need to be successful after graduation.The program helps students to gain real-world work experience in their chosen field of study, and at the same time provides them with financial assistance to help cover the costs of their education.
I am clear about the registration fee, and I understand that it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship.

7.Yes, I am clear about the registration fee process. Once I receive the offer letter from the University, I will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize my selection and reserve my seat. This fee will be adjusted in my first year's annual fee after scholarship. I understand that this process is to ensure that I am committed to my studies and will be able to cover the costs of my education.
