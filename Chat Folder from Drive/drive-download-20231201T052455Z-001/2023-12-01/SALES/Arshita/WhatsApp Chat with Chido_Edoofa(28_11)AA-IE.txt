29/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 139 7505: That's interesting
29/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 139 7505: Wow this is amazing
29/11/23, 12:30 pm - Arshita: Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of law?
29/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 139 7505: No not really

29/11/23, 12:40 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
29/11/23, 12:40 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
29/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 139 7505: I'll work as hard as I can to achieve it
29/11/23, 12:46 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
29/11/23, 12:46 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
29/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 139 7505: Not yet I hadn't applied at any university yet
29/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 139 7505: My deepest condolences my network is tripping
29/11/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: I can understand the challenge
29/11/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

*BA LLB: Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law*

Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 139 7505: A Bachelor of Legislative Law, also known as LL.B., is an undergraduate degree in law. It is a professional degree that prepares students for a career in the legal field.

29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Arshita: If you have understood the course well, can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?

29/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 139 7505: So I believe that with that I'll be able to achieve my career goals
29/11/23, 1:43 pm - Arshita: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career.I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.
 
So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
29/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 139 7505: University System: Undergraduate education in India is primarily offered by universities, both central and state c universities, as well as autonomous institutions and colleges affiliated with universities. Each university or institution has its own admission criteria, curriculum, and evaluation methods.

Entrance Examinations: Many undergraduate programs in India require students to appear for entrance examinations for admission. These entrance exams assess the students' aptitude, subject knowledge, and skills in specific areas. Some of the prominent entrance exams in India include the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for engineering, the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical courses, and various state-level entrance exams.
29/11/23, 1:59 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your knowledge

Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system.

29/11/23, 1:59 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
29/11/23, 1:59 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics

29/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 139 7505: I didn't know this you really shocked me
29/11/23, 2:16 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
29/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 139 7505: No  am not
29/11/23, 6:12 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/11/23, 6:12 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 6:12 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
29/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 139 7505: Not really
29/11/23, 6:16 pm - Arshita: I can understand that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
29/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 139 7505: No can you explain more further
29/11/23, 6:22 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
29/11/23, 6:22 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
29/11/23, 6:22 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/11/23, 6:22 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/11/23, 6:22 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
29/11/23, 6:22 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje

29/11/23, 6:22 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
29/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 139 7505: Yes of course
29/11/23, 6:58 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
29/11/23, 6:58 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 139 7505: Now it very clear thank you
29/11/23, 7:01 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
29/11/23, 7:01 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
29/11/23, 7:01 pm - Arshita: *2.
