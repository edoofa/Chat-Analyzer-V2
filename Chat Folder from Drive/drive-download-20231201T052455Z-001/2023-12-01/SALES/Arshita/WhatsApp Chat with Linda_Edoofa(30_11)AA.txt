30/11/23, 6:40 pm - Arshita: As per the protocols of the program, the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary for the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So I am making you the admin of the group so please add them and let me know once they are added.*

In case they are not available right now, they can still be part of a group and catch up with the conversations later. Let me know the names with which I should address them.

30/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 561 1920: 1) Well l got motivated by the facts that the edoofa scholarship program not only gives opportunities to the disadvantaged but it provides favourable circumstances for every bright student to apply which demonstrate s that the edoofa scholarship program is considerate
Secondly the edoofa scholarship program is affordable which reduces the pressure and stress from our parents and guardians
Another factor which motivated me is that the edoofa scholarship program offers quality education to its students according to my understanding of the program
30/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 561 1920: 2)Well from my discussions with kudzai l understood that the edoofa scholarship program was initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions pvt Ltd which allows disadvantaged and Bright students to persue their education abroad at lower cost. Edoofa scholarship program has its own benefits which include the facts that it is affordable, provides good education for the students and there is a reduction of tuition fee through the Earn while you learn program. The Earn while you learn program is an added advantage in the sense that a student's semester fee is reduced n this not only advantages the student but also the family of the student as they will not have to worry about being able to afford part of the fees and above all a student will not have to worry about employment after acquiring knowledge as the edoofa scholarship program will be available to offer help in finding employment. I also understood that the edoofa scholarship program stays with it's students throughout their course which is  a great advantage.
