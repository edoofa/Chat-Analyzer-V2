Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I have been expecting proper participation, for your application for Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
