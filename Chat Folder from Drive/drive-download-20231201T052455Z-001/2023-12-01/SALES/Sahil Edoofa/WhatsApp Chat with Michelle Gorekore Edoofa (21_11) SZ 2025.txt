23/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 235 4301: My father

*"Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." – Winston Churchill*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
24/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 78 235 4301: Yes I'm ready
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Michelle!
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Michelle. However, since the coursework is extremely intrinsic for the evaluation, can you please share your previous term results in a textual format?
24/11/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I don't remember my exact scores but l got zero points from all the 4 subjects
24/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether there is a specific reason for that, please?
24/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Nope. I just did not study hard enough
24/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
24/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I am confident
24/11/23, 2:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe you will ace your exams with flying colors, Michelle! Can you please brief me regarding your A-Level subject combination? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I'm doing Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Statistics
24/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! That information will suffice for now but I believe you will be sending the documents as well.
24/11/23, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
24/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 235 4301: What kind of documents
24/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I want to be a gynecologist
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your previous term results, Michelle.
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew you towards that peculiar domain, please?
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Oky l will
24/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I just want to help women to maintain their reproductive health and to make sure they have  access to quality care. I also want to help women to feel comfortable and supported during sensitive and personal appointments.
24/11/23, 3:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your dedication to supporting and advocating for women's reproductive health is truly commendable. The fact that you aspire to ensure women have access to quality care while also prioritizing their comfort and emotional well-being during sensitive appointments reflects a deep sense of compassion and understanding, Michelle! Could you please share why you didn't pursue Physics in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
24/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yes it is very crucial and l also didn't understand it when l was doing my O level
24/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 235 4301: That's why l did not pursue it.
24/11/23, 3:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
24/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 235 4301: So l have to study Physics too?
24/11/23, 3:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Michelle Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with your A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yes please
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that you could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
24/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Bachelor of science in optometry
24/11/23, 3:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what do you find fascinating about that domain, please?
24/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Learning more about eyes
24/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bachelor of Science in Optometry
*Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.

It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.

The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.

Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.

They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.
24/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Thank you for the information
24/11/23, 3:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So does the course align with your career aspirations?
24/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yeah l think it does
24/11/23, 3:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have any other course in mind, please?

24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
24/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 235 4301: The science field captivates me the most and my interests came from the fact that my father was also science student but he did not get the chance to study further so he is giving me the opportunity to study and become a doctor not that I'm doing it for the fact he did not become one bt for my love of sciences as l am a very curious person just like him.
24/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You mentioned your affinity for the Science field. Since Science encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues you?
24/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Biology
24/11/23, 10:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>

*B.Sc Microbiology*
*B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Do you want me to guide you about the course in depth?
27/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yes
27/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: B.Sc Microbiology
*B.Sc. in Microbiology* is a 3- year long, full- time course divided into 6 semesters, with each semester lasting for a period of 6 months. Microbiology has emerged as a key biological science since microorganisms provide the model used in molecular biology for research purposes.

Such research at the molecular level has provided and continues to provide answers to numerous fundamental questions in Genetics, Metabolism, Cell forms & functions. There is a growing recognition of the potential of microorganisms in a range of applied areas.

The ability of microorganisms to degrade oil in oil spills, herbicides, pesticides, and to supplement food, produce energy, besides other uses of microorganisms is becoming increasingly relevant and useful. Microbiologists study these organisms using tools, like microscopes, genetics, and culturing.

Microscopes allow scientists to magnify microbial cells that are otherwise too small to see. Genetics and Molecular Biology help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships between microbes and their habitats. Culturing is the term used to describe growing microbes, usually combined with tests to see what the microbes like to eat or what conditions they can live in. A petri dish is a common place where microbes are cultivated.

Infections from pathogenic bacteria can sometimes clear up on their own, or with help from antibiotics. Antibiotics are the various medicines that fight bacteria by damaging proteins, the cell wall, or carrying out other damaging attacks on bacteria. A flipside to antibiotics is that they can rarely tell the difference between good and bad bacteria.

 *What is it about?*

Microbiology is a broad discipline that involves the study of the biology of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. The main focus of the course is the pathogenic potential of the organisms that cause disease in man. The course also covers aspects of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms.

Recently, our knowledge of how microbes function has expanded enormously, both in the disease process and at the molecular level. Genetic engineers use bacteria and viruses to clone eukaryotic genes to study and treat human genetic disorders. Vaccines are being developed for diseases such as AIDS, Legionnaire's disease and listeriosis.

In the areas of biotechnology, agriculture and food production, microbes are continually exploited for the benefit of man. Microbiologists are needed to do the research required for the future battle against diseases worldwide and to apply microbes in the production of food.

 *Career Prospects*

Microbiologists are in demand in medical research, quality control, and the biotechnology industry. Many such graduates secure jobs as researchers working in universities, pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and institutes.

Successful graduates of the course also progress into laboratory-based careers in clinical or technical roles which do not involve research. The transferable skills one develops also equip one well for a wide range of careers outside the lab.

There are several job opportunities for those who want to pursue a career in microbiology. Microbiologists can find job opportunities in sectors such as government and private hospitals, food industries, research and development organizations, chemical industries and pharmaceutical industries.

They can also choose a career as science writer, writing articles for professional microbiologists.

*Some of the popular professional avenues open to such graduates are:*
*Bacteriologist*
A Bacteriologist is responsible for studying various kinds of bacteria, which are constantly changing and evolving. They typically perform research in a laboratory, mostly for government or pharmaceutical agencies.    

*Virologist*
A Virologist is a professional who studies the growth, development, structure and characteristics of different viruses. He isolates and makes cultures of significant viruses in a standard inhibitory medium, controlling certain factors, like, aeration, moisture, temperature, and nutrition.    

*Mycologist*    
A Mycologist is a scientist who studies fungi that is known to be an independent organism similar to animals, algae, plants and bacteria. Mycologists study operations of organism- based processes of poisonous, edible and parasitic fungi in order to discover organisms useful in medicine, industry and agriculture.    

*Cell biologist*    
Cell biologists research and study the properties, interactions and structure of cellular molecules from which they can extrapolate basic principles or generalizations about the effects of cell behaviour on an organism. For example, looking at how certain cell behaviours contribute to the progression of cancer in the body.     

*Biochemist*    
Biochemists work with the chemical composition of living organisms and perform studies of the chemical processes involved in all basic life functions. Through research, experimentation and study, these professionals provide us with much of the background knowledge on topics like genetics and heredity.

*"Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot, but make it hot by striking." - William Butler Yeats*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
29/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 235 4301: Yes I'm ready
29/11/23, 11:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Michelle!
29/11/23, 11:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
29/11/23, 11:44 am - +263 78 235 4301: Yes l am. Thank you
29/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 235 4301: No  I'm not familiar with with the costs
29/11/23, 11:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Michelle! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
29/11/23, 11:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 11:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
29/11/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 235 4301: I really don't know
29/11/23, 12:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please elaborate, Michelle?
29/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I think my father should be the one answering that because he is the one who pays my fees
29/11/23, 1:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Michelle. I will be waiting for his response.
29/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 235 4301: He said it's affordable
29/11/23, 7:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Michelle! You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
29/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Nope
29/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Michelle. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
29/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
29/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
29/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I think so
29/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
29/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
29/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
29/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

29/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
29/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yes l understand
29/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
29/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
29/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
29/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 235 4301: The fact that students are helped in gaining real world experience instead of academic theory, Scholarship credits that help by reducing the cost of our education, Edoofa being there for us in the journey of higher education.
29/11/23, 8:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Michelle! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
29/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Edoofa staying with us throughout our journey of higher education
29/11/23, 8:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Michelle. One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
29/11/23, 8:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Thank you
29/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 235 4301: They are okay with it
29/11/23, 8:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
29/11/23, 8:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
29/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yes it is
29/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
29/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
29/11/23, 8:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 8:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
29/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Okay I see
29/11/23, 8:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
29/11/23, 8:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
29/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Okay
29/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
29/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Michelle Gorekore Edoofa (21/11) SZ" to "Michelle Gorekore Edoofa (21/11) SZ 2025"
29/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 235 4301: I think we have discussed everything and I'm still at phase 01
29/11/23, 8:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
29/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yes please
29/11/23, 8:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
29/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 235 4301: Yes I'm clear
29/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
