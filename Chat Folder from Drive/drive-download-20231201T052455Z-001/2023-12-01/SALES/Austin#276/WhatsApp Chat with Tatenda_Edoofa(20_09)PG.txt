As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add your mother and brother to the group?*
In case they are not available right now, they can still be part of a group and catch up with the conversations later

21/09/23, 9:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Mr. Edwin Chidakwa,

I am Ms. Pallika, a career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us, Mr. Austin, Senior Career Counselor, and  Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa


We have received the application of Tatenda for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
21/09/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 330 5022: Thank you Ms. Pallika, and Hi everyone. I am available for the next 30 minutes from now.

I really appreciate for considering Tatenda's application.
21/09/23, 9:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Edward. I truly appreciate your support for Tatenda's application.

Since Tatenda is pursuing higher education abroad, I'm curious if you've had a chance to discuss what's been happening in the group so far? It would be wonderful to hear your thoughts and insights on the matter.
21/09/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 330 5022: We had a short brief last night about that. My opinion I think it's a good program for him viewing on the young man's dreams, ambitions and finance status... I will be grateful to see him being successful enrolled on the journey and hoping it will giving him a better future and able to assist others
21/09/23, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Edwin, Thank you for sharing your thoughts, and it's wonderful to hear your positive perspective on the program for Tatenda. Your support and optimism are greatly appreciated, and we all share the hope for his success and bright future, one that can benefit not only him but also others in the long run. <This message was edited>
21/09/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 330 5022: I appreciated
21/09/23, 10:25 am - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate Tatenda, that he had shared thoroughly about himself.
21/09/23, 10:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Edwin, Continuing our discussion, Tatenda mentioned that he wants to pursue Bio-Medical Laboratory Science or Nursing Science, So, may I know what fascinated him about pursuing this course and career in this?
21/09/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 330 5022: The main challenge tatenda is facing is financial assistant and better quality education. Looking at the tertiary education in our country especially in science and technology programs. The education system is performing well.
21/09/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 330 5022: I am the only one who was providing fees for him and also ensuring that he get all the basic needs of life. But its now getting out hand for me to continue. I am also taking care of our mother and also my family. I don't know if he highlighted this. I am also  a living Kidney donor to my elder brother and at the moment I am also assist my elder brother for him to getting the medication which he is taking for a life time.
21/09/23, 10:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Edwin, Your dedication and the responsibilities you've shouldered are truly commendable. We understand the challenges you're facing. Please note that the scholarship program aims to provide a student 50-100% scholarship also, Students can achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship as a 100% scholarship, students won't have to pay the *tuition fees* and will be left with only the living expenses. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family that will surely lessen your burden,
21/09/23, 12:09 pm - +263 77 330 5022: Noted its sounds good
21/09/23, 12:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!
21/09/23, 12:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Edwin, Tatenda has shared her A-level results with me, and she has stated that she wishes to study Bio-Medical Laboratory Science or Nursing Science, correct?

May I know why the grades are so low?
21/09/23, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country. Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.


So, Mr. Edwin, If she wants to pursue a career in that field, why did she not choose Physics for her A-Level?
21/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 330 5022: I am noting all your messages. Can you allow me to answer in the afternoon when I find time. Cause now i am going for a meeting
21/09/23, 12:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Mr. Edwin, Please let me know once available.
21/09/23, 9:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you very much. 

I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused.
22/09/23, 9:22 am - +263 77 330 5022: Good morning everyone
22/09/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 330 5022: My apologies for the late response. Yesterday I went busy with work.
22/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 330 5022: From my assessment, it was due to family issues which were running during his time for studying and examination. We were being affected heavily cause that was the period when my brother was recovering and me as well. So it affected every member in our family. But from how I know him he is a person who all tries to do the best in everything that he does
22/09/23, 9:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
22/09/23, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Edwin, Thank you for sharing that insight into his challenges during that period. It's clear that he's dedicated and strives for excellence despite the difficulties. We appreciate your understanding. However, we have courses in *Bio-Medical Laboratory Science* available to support his education and growth.

Thus all true on what Tatenda has sited. We tried to manage the little resources (avaliable funds) and we have agreed that we hold on clearing the outstanding amount at his previous school although we are in the process of raising funds to clear it and we ensured that we make him to re-register this year exam sitting after seeing him his ambitions and determination ... The only result we have was online results thus the ones we share on Friday. So the school helped Tatenda for the sake of this program to proceed and they decided to share the results directly to you...

26/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky as l mentioned  above that I know india as one of the best countries interms of Medical and Engineering sector.

Studying  in India will have a positive impact on my career because Indian degrees are globally recognized which will be an advantage  in opening doors to a wide range of  opportunities even job opportunities outside the country.

Studying in india will be of my advantage  in terms of my practicals as compared doing my degree here in Zimbabwe were we have poor laboratories , apparatus  and technology.

So if l study in India l will have more practical  skills which will help  especially  the time l will be in industry. 

And lastly studying in India  according to my own reach is very affordable and they have various scholarship, so it will be easy for me , since my family is even failing to support me with secondary  fees
26/09/23, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tatenda.

26/09/23, 4:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 643 4112: Good Morning  to you!

My apology for late reply, but thank you for the video. I feel so comfortable  and l hope 1 day l will stand and testify as a proud  Edoofian. 
I am ready for today's session.
27/09/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 643 4112: So yesterday  Ms Pallika  you asked me if we are aware of the expense of high education for an international student.

Yes we are aware
27/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 643 4112: My brother Edwin.
27/09/23, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable, Tatenda

So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
27/09/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 643 4112: If my elder brother Nelson gets job maybe he will be able to contribute also but its almost 3 years since he lost his job after kidney transplant operation
27/09/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 643 4112: My family always wanted me to study abroad despite  financial  challenges. And l can see everyone now  is hoping  that maybe this is now going to happen through Edoofa .
I can say now Edoofa is our only hope
27/09/23, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, That is well noted!!
27/09/23, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tatenda, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
27/09/23, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
Isn't it?
27/09/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes it is
27/09/23, 1:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed Tatenda,

When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
27/09/23, 1:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
27/09/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you are clear upto this. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
27/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes you can go ahead <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 643 4112: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tatenda, I'll tell you more about this cycle later, but I'm interested in the source of this image, and where did you acquire it.
27/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 643 4112: From 1 of edoofian student who is already in india now. I acquired it when l was search and trying to get to know more about Edoofa
27/09/23, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the name of the student and what relation he/she is having with you?
27/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Vincent and he is a friend to me
27/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you
27/09/23, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that Vincent is your friend, and you will be glad to know that he's doing exceptionally well and earning substantial scholarship credits here.
27/09/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tatenda, please note that It is important to remember that you don't have to hurry, considering that both your courses and journeys are distinct. There's no need to rush by seeking information from him or through the internet, as I'm here to provide you with thorough guidance and support.
27/09/23, 2:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Proceeding further, Please let me tell you that This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
27/09/23, 2:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 643 4112: I really do appreciate
27/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Noted with thanks Ms Pallika
27/09/23, 2:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 643 4112: As for me l think we were on stage 1 for stage 2 up to 6 am not sure
27/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Am sorry Ms Pallika the last message you have sent on 1500hrsCAT am not being able to see it because of my whatsapp version <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 3:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Tatenda.
27/09/23, 3:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Tatenda,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
27/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky it is so clear to me now
27/09/23, 3:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please acknowledge this, Tatenda.
27/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky Ms Pallika.  

Thank you for helping and counselling  me
27/09/23, 3:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tatenda, please ensure that you carefully read all the information shared in this group. In the previous message, I mentioned that I could explain the remaining steps, but it appears you may have missed that part. Active participation is crucial, as emphasized from the beginning, so please keep that in mind moving forward.
27/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes you can explain to me
27/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Excuse me for the late reply.
Am sorry Ms Pallika
27/09/23, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
27/09/23, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
27/09/23, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
27/09/23, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tatenda, Are we connected?
27/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 643 4112: So my family will be the one to pay the registration fee or edoofa will help me
27/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 643 4112: I had lost network so l was trying to fix it
27/09/23, 4:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tatenda
27/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Sure
27/09/23, 4:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tatenda, Please note that The registration fee($500-$750) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600
27/09/23, 4:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/09/23, 12:00 pm - Austin#276: I am so glad to hear this, Tatenda!
29/09/23, 12:01 pm - Austin#276: So may I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
29/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 643 4112: My family appreciate Edoofa for making it affordable  for me to study in India if am found eligible, we saw that for  an international  student to study in India  will need almost $6000 to $8000 per year without scholarship  and to be honest there was never going  be a way for my family to afford this.

Now they do appreciate  Edoofa  that it will reduce these costs to $2000 to $3000  per year which is affordable  for an average family.

 Now being honest looking at the state my family is in right now it is still difficult for them to afford  it even if l am found eligible and they were seeing that as a block, until they had about Earn while you are learning program where l will get credits per month to reduce the costs and that will be our only hope and l will have to work hard for me to get more credits  so that they will be able to afford , but besides  earn while learning program,it will be so difficult for them
29/09/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 643 4112: And interms of enrolment  fee it might be a challenge  raising $350 within  7 days but when it was explained to us that  Edoofa will provide with a flexible fee paynent option as well,where if the student found eligible then instead of paying entire fee in 7 days,parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days. We saw that it will make it so easy for them and they did appreciate . <This message was edited>
29/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Excuse me for late reply , right now am facing netwrk challenge.  But am trying my best to fix it

06/10/23, 12:06 pm - Austin#276: That is correct, your application will be revoked and the scholarship seat will be allotted to the next deserving candidate. This is the reason, we have a process where we discuss the preparations and timeframe in detail and proceed only with the confirmations of the family so that there is no unfortunate incidents towards the end
06/10/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky sir how about the registration fee .what will be the time frame
06/10/23, 12:36 pm - Austin#276: The registration fee is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $1800 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $1800-600= $1200
06/10/23, 12:37 pm - Austin#276: Our Admissions team will guide you through payment plan and you will receive few weeks to more than a month to pay the same

06/10/23, 1:28 pm - Austin#276: I understand and how much time will your family require to raise the first part of the enrollment fees?

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

a) The Change of Nature
b) The Will to Fight

d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.

3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ?
a) enfeeble
b) thriving
c) strengthen
d) debase

4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’.
a) Find peace in times of difficulty.
b) To remain calm and not to lose hope.
c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty.
d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.

5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

a) The Change of Nature

d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.✅

3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ?
a) enfeeble✅

*_SECTION 5 ESSAY WRITING_*

Write a short essay of about 200 words 

*_TOPIC: Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient?_*

The assumption that many Africans have poor diets due to stagnant and inefficient farms might be true but its  oversimplification that fails to consider various factors.

Firstly, it is crucial to recognize the immense diversity across the African continent in terms of geography, culture, and agricultural practices. While some regions may face challenges in agricultural productivity, it is inaccurate to generalize the entire continent based on specific cases. Many African countries have made significant progress in modernizing their farming techniques, adopting sustainable practices, and utilizing technology to enhance output.

Moreover, the focus on farming alone disregards other significant factors that contribute to poor diets, such as socioeconomic inequality, limited access to quality healthcare, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of education on nutrition. These multifaceted issues intersect to impact individuals' dietary choices and overall nutritional status.

Furthermore, the portrayal of Africans as solely reliant on traditional farming methods ignores the vibrant and growing urban areas where diets are often influenced by a range of factors, including access to processed foods, changing lifestyles, and globalization.

It is important to move beyond the oversimplified assumption that stagnant and inefficient farms are the primary cause of poor diets in Africa. A comprehensive understanding of the complex factors involved is essential for effective solutions.

"My Inspirational Story"

Everytime l imagine my self going to work l always see my self wearing a lab court, working in Hospital  Laboratories as l told my self that l am a great labouratory scientists. At the time l was form 2 , l saw it becoming difficult  for me to become  a laboratory  scientist as l was learning  school which specialised in commercials and arts .

I used to cry and understimate my self until l choosed to believe in my self and to go for what l wanted to become and thats where my journey  begins. I started to study science  subjects alone and most of my friend discouraged  me, sayinh negative words but l just countined to keep my eye focus on the price. 
I did my studies and when it was time to register my parents were not able to afford money to register science  subjects for me, at first it did affected me a lot until l choosed to start working and selling different beverages for me to raise money to register. It was a tough moment but as day there is always the sunrise and light will always shine at the end . I was so happy when l managed  to pass my O level and  l went to A level .

I am really inspired and always motivated with the way l grow up and here to tell to everyone who might be going through challenge  in his or her career to keep pushing hard because at the end light always overcome the darknes .l am happy now that soon l mighy be a Medical laboratory scientist through Edoofa program.
