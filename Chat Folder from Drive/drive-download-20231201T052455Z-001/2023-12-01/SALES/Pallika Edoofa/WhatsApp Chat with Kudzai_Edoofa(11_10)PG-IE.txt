Continuing our discussion, you mentioned that you want to pursue as a Lawyer or motivational speaker, So, may I know what fascinated you about pursuing this course and career as a Lawyer or motivational speaker? and to which course you are more inclined to?

13/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Beforehand we got there..i wanted to ask you..that.. for one to pursue law how many points do you expect them to have
13/10/23, 3:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kudzai, please let me know if you are referring to the points in A level

I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
13/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Yes points at A level
13/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Ohhhh.. ok
13/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 842 0354: So this makes me inclined to law
13/10/23, 8:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Thank you

20/10/23, 8:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by DAY, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?

23/11/23, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's not a problem
23/11/23, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/11/23, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*

23/11/23, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
23/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 842 0354: I don't know. Would you mind telling me

24/11/23, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Thank you

24/11/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
24/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 842 0354: So $75 is the minimum a student gets
24/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 842 0354: My parents will be helping me
24/11/23, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kudzai, It depends upon the student's hardwork!! ad there is no limit to earn as much scholarship credits as she/he can <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
24/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Thank you
24/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 842 0354: They are okay with it and are in fool support as they want that which is best for me
24/11/23, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kudzai, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
24/11/23, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 842 0354: A level results 
A students Visa
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
24/11/23, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 842 0354: For affordability right
24/11/23, 1:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
.
24/11/23, 1:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes!!
24/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Yes you may
24/11/23, 1:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
24/11/23, 1:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/11/23, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Ohhh I understand
24/11/23, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!
24/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Do u also help students with their Visa
24/11/23, 2:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Kudzai, We will be assisting you in the Visa Procedures too
24/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Thank you
24/11/23, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Kudzai, before ending the session, I would like to know when will you be sending your A level results with me ?
24/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 842 0354: I will give them to you in January.... when the zimsec board has done marking them
24/11/23, 2:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, So, do you have your term results?

24/11/23, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Thank you for understanding
24/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 842 0354: I think it's 2
24/11/23, 2:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
24/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Ohh really
24/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 842 0354: You may go on
24/11/23, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
24/11/23, 2:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
24/11/23, 2:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
24/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 842 0354: Yes..I am
24/11/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Kudzai, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*

The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 
This cost can be further reduced by an Edoofian through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program
29/11/23, 5:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are two options for Accommodation from which you are free to choose. 

1) Campus Accommodation- Students live in hostels inside the University premises.You are free to choose the type of hostel rooms and the seaters. There are single seaters, two seaters and more. 

2) Outside Campus-Accommodation is arranged in apartments outside the University campus. It is close to Universities and cheaper than in campus

After the University Sessions you will be given these options and can choose from them
