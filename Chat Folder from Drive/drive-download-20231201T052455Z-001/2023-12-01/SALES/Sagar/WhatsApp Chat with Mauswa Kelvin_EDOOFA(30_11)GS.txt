30/11/23, 4:07 pm - Sagar: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you did not mention what course you would like to study, could you please share that and what motivates you behind this field of study?
30/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 968 2598: I would like to study businesses management because l feel like for you to understand the insights of any business for example your own business you should be in a position to manage it so well because business management looks both the internal and the external environment of the business what are the strength , weaknesses, threats and opportunities of the business so by studying business management l will be in a position to know fully about the business or company in particular and since am that one person that analyzes things more before concluding by doing management l will be in a position to make informed decisions that's why l chose to business management
