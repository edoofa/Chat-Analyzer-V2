30/11/23, 8:37 am - Sagar: Noted.

30/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 928 5360: After 2 hours
30/11/23, 8:52 am - Sagar: Noted.
30/11/23, 4:36 pm - Sagar: Hi Vimbai, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
