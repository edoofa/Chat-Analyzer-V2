For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
11/08/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we can
11/08/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I have through the image
11/08/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
11/08/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
11/08/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes they are
11/08/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
11/08/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
11/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I'm following
11/08/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/08/23, 2:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
11/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes they are very clear
11/08/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
11/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I want ask the Visa process
11/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I want to ask about the Visa process
11/08/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, dear. May I know what you wish to know about the VISA process?
11/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I want to know if I will be the one to pay for the visa
11/08/23, 2:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased that you inquired about this; it reflects your enthusiasm for your higher education. Allow me to provide assistance in this matter. The VISA fee needs to be submitted directly to the embassy by either the student, parent, or guardian. This expense falls under the category of additional costs that you will need to cover. I hope we are on the same page here?
11/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 804 2552: How is the visa
11/08/23, 2:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are referring to the price?
11/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes how much
11/08/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The VISA fee amounts to $83. It's worth noting that this visa fee is a one-time payment and remains valid throughout your entire higher education journey in India. Please let me know if you are clear?
11/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Okay thanks
11/08/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
11/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes please
11/08/23, 2:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, Sibonginkosi. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
11/08/23, 2:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

I am sharing you with the videos now, dear.
11/08/23, 2:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
17/08/23, 1:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
17/08/23, 1:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now, dear?
17/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we are
17/08/23, 1:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, dear. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
17/08/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by this evening at 9:00 PM.
17/08/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully.

18/08/23, 2:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the document with me. Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.

*For that, I believe you want to pursue BBA course for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake, right?*
18/08/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes that's what I want
18/08/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
19/08/23, 7:03 am - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I'm ready
19/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 804 2552: Good morning
19/08/23, 10:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Sibonginkosi. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please let me know if you are available to proceed with the session. <This message was edited>
19/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I'm available
19/08/23, 2:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, dear. Shall we now proceed with the sesison?
19/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we can
19/08/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
19/08/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
19/08/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes that's true
19/08/23, 2:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct, dear. So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
19/08/23, 2:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.
19/08/23, 2:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
19/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes he did discuss them
19/08/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
19/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes it is
19/08/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
19/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes it is clear
19/08/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months.
19/08/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
19/08/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I'm following
19/08/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be?
19/08/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I don't have any queries but I want to ask about the registration fee
19/08/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, dear. Please ask
19/08/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 804 2552: The the registration fee is paid after I have received my A level results
19/08/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For that, we have a piece of exciting news for you coming up and I am happy to share it with you on Monday. So for a hint, you can proceed with the registration with the help of your Statement of Entry. For Further details, we shall have a detailed discussion on Monday at 12:00 PM. May I know if this works for you?
19/08/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 804 2552: At 12PM I will be at school may you reschedule it please maybe b4 12
19/08/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, dear. In that case, shall we connect at 7:30 PM Monday in the evening?
19/08/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we can connect
19/08/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, let us conclude our conversation for now and we will reconnect on Monday at 7:30 pm for our next session. Have a great weekend.
19/08/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Thank you and take care
22/08/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Sibonginkosi. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I was not abe to connect with you yesterday as I was occupied with some unforeseen work. Please let me know if you are available anytime now to proceed with our sesison.

22/08/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I'm available
22/08/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Sibonginkosi. Kindly excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. Please, shall we continue?
22/08/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes
22/08/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs. Furthermore, your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program is scheduled to begin alongside our ongoing session. So, I am now sharing you with the EWYL details first.
22/08/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Sibonginkosi EWYL23E0528*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/CBitrTXWTHv0fZQ91LyClv"
22/08/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Magwazimbiza Sibonginkosi and my EWYL group name is Sibonginkosi EWYL23E0528.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
22/08/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
22/08/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Thank you and I will do so soon after I connect with my mentor
22/08/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, dear. Now dear, let's delve into the eagerly awaited announcement. We have some fantastic news for students like you who are currently navigating the admission process. This unique opportunity is time-sensitive and brings with it significant advantages for those who opt to finalize their admission ahead of schedule, specifically before your *A-Level/Grade-12* results are released. This can be achieved with the assistance of your statement of entry.

By making this early decision, you can position yourself to reap benefits that can reduce your cost of Higher Education. I hope we are on the same page here?
22/08/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we are
22/08/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear! I've reviewed the session you had with your counselor, and it's heartening to see the unwavering support your family is providing to help realize your dream of higher education.

While the pursuit of education is a significant achievement, it's important to recognize that it's not the sole responsibility your family bears. They have various other commitments and obligations, and over time, they might encounter certain challenges that they'll strive to manage without burdening you.
22/08/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes that's true
22/08/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, on behalf of your application, I want to emphasize that we're committed to assisting you not only during the enrollment process but also in managing your finances for university admission. Just as we facilitated your enrollment fee payments in installments, we're here to extend similar support for the admission process.
22/08/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Speaking of which, there's an exciting Early Decision Benefit available for applicants for the 2024 intake. It's designed to provide advantageous terms for those who choose to make an early commitment to their admission process. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
22/08/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 804 2552: No I haven't been made aware
22/08/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I understand Sibonginkosi, it is alright. So, basically under this program, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.*
22/08/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
22/08/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes it is that's wonderful news
22/08/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed. So, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
22/08/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I would love to know
22/08/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
22/08/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 804 2552: No I wasn't
22/08/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Get Early Access to Scholarship Seats in the Top Indian Universities with Edoofa.

2. Get an opportunity to keep your university fee structure as of the current batch of admissions.

3. Get an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. No Financial Pressure of making the payment in one go, there is an option of making the payment of the registration fee in 2 parts over a period of 30-45 days.

And for the student, who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, they get the following 2 benefits as well if they choose to get the early decision benefits:

5. If a student fails to bring in a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, an option to change the course to a Diploma Program will be given so that the student doesn't lose a year.

6. If a student fails to bring in a minimum of 2 passes in the A-level Examination, and neither wants to start a diploma course, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program.*

Are you clear on these benefits?
22/08/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we are
22/08/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:

1. Since you are yet to get your A-Level results, but when you connect with the universities for your admission process now, it makes you an early applicant. Here, you will be given a provisional letter of intent from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned after you complete your registration formalities when your result comes, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point.
23/08/23, 12:25 am - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I am
23/08/23, 12:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Sibonginkosi. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.
23/08/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Afternoon how are you
23/08/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am fine, thank you for asking. May I know if you are available to further proceed with the session?
23/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I am
23/08/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. That is wonderful to hear, dear. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.

Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.

Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
23/08/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes
23/08/23, 2:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I am glad to hear that. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
23/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes
23/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I need to assist something may I
23/08/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes please, dear.
23/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Okay thank you
23/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I want to ask that are we going to pay the registration fee in January or it will Feb ... I just want to know so that my parents will be able to arrange the money
23/08/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern with me. If you are planning to proceed with your registration for the early decision benefits, you will be able to receive the offer letter within 2 weeks' time and will be able to pay the fees accordingly. Meaning within a time span of 45 days from the date of the arrival of the offer letter.
23/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Okay I see so January is very far
23/08/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is accurate, dear. If you are clear shall we proceed with the discussion?
23/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we can
23/08/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I am pleased to hear that. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving the option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 1st September 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 1st September 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 1st Octtober 2024. Any queries so far?
23/08/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I don't have any
23/08/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 5. That is great to know. Now, when your A-Level Results come and if you fail to bring a minimum of 2 passes, then it means, you cannot get admission for bachelor's courses anywhere around the world.

But, here at Edoofa, we all understand that due to several reasons such as poor teaching practices, the absence of better learning resources, and the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the students have not been able to give their best and adjust to the new methods of learning, so keeping the same in mind and to ensure the best for our students, we will get the students admitted to a Diploma course so that the student doesn't waste a year and have a break in higher education. Isn’t it a good solution?
23/08/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes it is
23/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 804 2552: What if the students passes his / her A Level with 13-15 points
23/08/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you would have the chance to revise your scholarship percentage, dear.
23/08/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Okay okay thats great
23/08/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 6. Glad to know that. Here, it might happen that if you failed to bring 2 passes in your A-Level, you may not wish to pursue a diploma course, nor you may want to re-write your A-Level Exams or join a Bachelor's program.

So, this basically means that you want to put your Academic Career to a halt. In such cases, you will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee that you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects. Along with that, you will also be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program.
23/08/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Okay I understand
23/08/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 6 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 6 points clear?
23/08/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes they are clear
23/08/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. So, we shall connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM for further process of our session. Have a great day ahead.
23/08/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Thank you

01/09/23, 12:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Sibonginkosi!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
01/09/23, 10:52 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I was facing challenges with the network
02/09/23, 8:29 am - +263 77 804 2552: Good morning
02/09/23, 10:23 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Sibonginkosi. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

02/09/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I'm available
04/09/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Sibonginkosi.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further on Saturday, as an unexpected meeting came up with the team and my presence was required. 

For the missed session that was planned, I would like to schedule our session this evening at 8:30 PM CAT. Please let me know if this timing works for you?
04/09/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes it does
04/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Afternoon how are you
04/09/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. May I know if you are ready to continue with your session for the admission process?
05/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Good afternoon
05/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I'm very sorry for yesterday there wasn't any network
05/09/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. May I know if you are available now to proceed with the session?
05/09/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I'm available
05/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Sibonginkosi, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day.
06/09/23, 5:19 am - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we did have an opportunity and my father said he will try his best and as I know that his job doesn't pay much  I was thinking of looking for some part time work after I have finished my A level
06/09/23, 5:19 am - +263 77 804 2552: A good morning to you
06/09/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Name.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 

It's wonderful that you've discussed the advantages of early decisions with your father. It shows a proactive approach to your education.

Considering your plan to potentially seek part-time work after completing your A levels, that's a commendable idea. For further continuation please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
06/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I am available
06/09/23, 3:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
06/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes they are available and they do not have any queries
06/09/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
06/09/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
06/09/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
06/09/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I do recall
06/09/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
06/09/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
06/09/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
06/09/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I am
06/09/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply our first slot of the day had just ended. That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
06/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we can
06/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 10th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 25th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
06/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes yes
06/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
06/09/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
06/09/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 10th of September, the deadline becomes the 25th of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 10th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 25th of September 2023, making the second deadline the 25th of September, 2023).

*Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?*
07/09/23, 7:02 am - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we are
07/09/23, 7:02 am - +263 77 804 2552: Good morning

07/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
08/09/23, 3:22 am - +263 77 804 2552: Yes they are clear

12/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the continuation of the previous message. Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, the deadline becomes the 1st of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 1st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 15th of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
13/09/23, 7:52 am - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we are

15/09/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we are available
15/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
15/09/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes they are
15/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
15/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Okay let me do so
15/09/23, 10:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.
15/09/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 804 2552: There's early registration and this has a grant that is paid by Edoofa of 150 and 600 will be left  , the first part of 300 is paid within 15 daysand if the deadline for the first part is 15 September then the second part will be paid will have to have been paid on the 15 of October
15/09/23, 10:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
15/09/23, 10:29 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Then there is standard registration where one has to pay 750 as per the procedures once one has received the offer letter from the University
15/09/23, 10:31 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I'm clear
15/09/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
15/09/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.
15/09/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *3rd October* and *3rd November*.
15/09/23, 10:37 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Would you mind if I call her father and see what he has decided whether the early decision benefit or the standard
15/09/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines (*3rd October* and *3rd November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Sibonginkosi’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
15/09/23, 10:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, kindly do that, please.
15/09/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Okay thank you
15/09/23, 10:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to have a discussion with your family and let us connect tomorrow in the meanwhile if you have decided to go ahead with the admission you can drop the request here. Have a great night.
15/09/23, 10:44 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Good night
18/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon dear parents and Sibonginkosi,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. How was your weekend?
18/09/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Our weekend wasn't okay because sibo was sick
18/09/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sorry to hear that. May I know what happened ?
18/09/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 804 2552: She was suffering from stomach ache
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How is Sibonginkosi doing ?

20/09/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes
20/09/23, 4:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding our previous conversation, may I know if your parents are connected with us to give us the official go-ahead for your university scholarship application?
20/09/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 804 2552: They aren't connected yet sir
20/09/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know by when they might be available to give us the go-ahead?
20/09/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 804 2552: When I get an update I will inform you they are not here at the moment they have gone to my grandma's place
20/09/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I shall wait for the same.
