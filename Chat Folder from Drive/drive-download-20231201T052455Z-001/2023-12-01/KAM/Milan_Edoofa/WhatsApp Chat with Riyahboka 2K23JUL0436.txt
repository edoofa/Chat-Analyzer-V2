17/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Riyahboka.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM. I understand that your schedules can be quite hectic, but I believe that dedicating just one hour of your time will be worthwhile. Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
17/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Get well soon
17/09/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Thank you hope you will be strong soon

I've been unwell, but I'm glad to report that I'm now on the path to recovery and looking forward to reconnecting with all of you. Are you currently available to connect with us?

We are alway available
07/10/23, 10:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 78 786 2520: We said that we are going to apply to universities and wait for them to respond and then we choose the one that is best
07/10/23, 10:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, may I know if you also recall the registration fee as well to reserve your seat with the university?
07/10/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 786 2520: $800
07/10/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are definitely close, the registration fee ranges from $500- $750. May I know if you recall now?
07/10/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 786 2520: Ohh yes I do recall <This message was edited>
07/10/23, 10:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
07/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 786 2520: No
07/10/23, 10:38 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
07/10/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 786 2520: Ok
07/10/23, 10:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
07/10/23, 10:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
07/10/23, 10:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
07/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 78 786 2520: Thank you
07/10/23, 10:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
07/10/23, 10:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
07/10/23, 10:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
07/10/23, 10:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
07/10/23, 11:02 am - +263 78 786 2520: Yes I am done
07/10/23, 11:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
07/10/23, 11:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263787862520 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
07/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 786 2520: Ok
07/10/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
07/10/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India. <This message was edited>
07/10/23, 11:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
07/10/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
07/10/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/10/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
07/10/23, 11:12 am - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
07/10/23, 11:12 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
07/10/23, 11:12 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
07/10/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 786 2520: No let’s continue
07/10/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 786 2520: Please provide information
07/10/23, 11:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 11:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 11:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
07/10/23, 11:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
07/10/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
07/10/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
07/10/23, 11:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
07/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 786 2520: Ok
07/10/23, 11:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/10/23, 11:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
07/10/23, 11:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
07/10/23, 11:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
07/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
07/10/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
07/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 786 2520: Ok
07/10/23, 11:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 786 2520: No
07/10/23, 11:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
07/10/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
07/10/23, 11:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. 
With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
07/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Ok thanks
07/10/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
14/10/23, 9:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Riyahboka.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

14/10/23, 3:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University.

14/10/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear, I will wait for the same.

2 The standard duration of a course is 3 years
3 The admission and procedure fee is$300
4 The registration fee is $750
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
15/10/23, 9:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 9:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 9:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Ok
15/10/23, 10:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
15/10/23, 10:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
15/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
15/10/23, 10:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
15/10/23, 10:53 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
15/10/23, 10:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 10:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 10:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 10:55 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
15/10/23, 10:55 pm - +263 78 786 2520: So is this the only university that accepted me
15/10/23, 10:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: We will discuss this as well moving ahead Riyahboka, for now may I know if you are clear till here?
15/10/23, 11:00 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
15/10/23, 11:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/10/23, 11:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier yesterday, hence, can you please let me know of this so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
16/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Good day
16/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 289 9378: We stay in Victoria falls
16/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/10/23, 4:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Ok thanks so this must be paid by 28 oct , let us try we will update when we have paid
16/10/23, 4:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right! Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
16/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Woo ok I think that will be better to use the same contact person
17/10/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
17/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Thank you i was wondering if we can wait for result of my daughter to come out in February so that we  all move together .To is we feel knowing how she performed with her results will motivate us more .This is our feeling as parents of Riyahboka but we also appreciate all the efforts you have done to make our daughter secure a scholarship. Is there an room to be patient until we see results so that we start paying the admission fees .
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if you wish to wait till the coming year, for completing Riyahboka's admission process, then being the Senior Admission Officer here, I would advise you to not do that, since there are several reasons to that. 

1. You would firstly lose on the Endowment Program Benefits that you are getting here. 
2. By the coming year most of the students would have completed their admission processes already and in that case Riyahboka might not get the same scholarship offers that she is getting now. 
3. Moreover, over the past 5-6 years that I have been helping the students in completing their admissions, I have seen that untimely actions in securing the scholarship often leads the students into getting to a position where they lose out on the scholarship seats entirely as by the time they become ready, the seats are already filled in. 

I hope you would understand the same right?
17/10/23, 6:11 pm - +263 78 786 2520: We do but what if my parents are not financially stable to pay at the moment
19/10/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Riyahboka!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 7:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Afternoon yes we will be available
19/10/23, 7:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Riyahboka!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Yes
19/10/23, 8:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, can you please help me in understanding more about the challenges that you are facing with respect to the finances please?
19/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 786 2520: We haven’t paid the school fees in full and the school is demanding their money
19/10/23, 8:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, if I may ask how much is the balance school fee please?
19/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 289 9378: US$300
19/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 786 2520: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 8:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, regarding that, by when do you think you would be able to raise the registration fee as well?
19/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Next year in February  2024
20/10/23, 12:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, I would like to know the reason why is that you are planning to move ahead with your admission in the coming year 2024 please?
20/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 786 2520: We already stated the reason of financial stability
20/10/23, 12:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that. However, on that note, you would lose on the the benefits as well as the scholarship opportunity that is being offered to you, and being your admission officer, I do not want that to happen, I hope you understand?
20/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, rather than directly moving the admission process to February 2024, shall we move ahead to discuss a plan with which you can secure the opportunity now without putting a strain on your finances?
20/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Ok
20/10/23, 9:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Moving ahead, if I would be able to discuss this with the academic board and get you the permission to pay the fee in more than two parts on a monthly basis, starting this month, would you be comfortable with the same?
20/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 786 2520: We have to settle the school fee first because it is due this month
20/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand your concern about the school fee, and it's important to prioritize your immediate financial obligations. However, I'd like to emphasize the significance of the scholarship opportunity at Galgotias University and why it's beneficial to secure it without delay.

On that note, if we can find a way to work together to manage both the school fee and the registration fee for the university, it would be ideal. You don't want to miss out on the scholarship opportunity, which could be a life-changing experience for your daughter right? <This message was edited>
24/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.

As you may know, today was Dussehra, a significant festival here in India, and our team was not available due to the holiday. On this auspicious occasion of Dussehra, I also extend my warmest wishes to you and your family. May the festival bring joy, prosperity, and success into your life. ✨

On that note, I would like to schedule a conversation with you at 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our discussion here about your admission process. I look forward to our discussion tomorrow, until then have a blessed evening!
25/10/23, 3:56 am - +263 77 289 9378: Thank you
25/10/23, 9:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 09:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
25/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 786 2520: Waiting for this message
25/10/23, 9:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. I understand the significance of providing you with some financial flexibility during the examination period to ensure your daughter's education remains a top priority. It's essential to balance education and finances.

On that note, I'd also like to emphasize the importance of your daughter's university admission. The deadline for securing her spot and the scholarship opportunity is approaching. If we delay, there's a risk of losing out on this valuable opportunity, and it could impact her future educational journey. I hope you agree with this, right?
25/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Am also at the conference in Zambia for 3 days maybe if we can chat in the evening
25/10/23, 4:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know at what time can we connect with each other for that?
26/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Let’s connect in the evening I will be back around 7-8 pm
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
02/11/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/11/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: It has been quite some time since we have connected with each other here. Moving ahead, can you please let me know what would be the right time for us to connect with each other here so that we can discuss more about Riyahboka's admission process please?
02/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 289 9378: We are good , let’s do it Monday around 11 am
02/11/23, 8:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. We will connect with each other here on Monday please.
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 06:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 06.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 6:08 am - +263 78 786 2520: Thank you
07/11/23, 6:45 am - +263 77 289 9378: Evening my brother it’s fine we will try to be available sometimes, we run a shop please also forgive us it will be busy and we forget our timetable
07/11/23, 6:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Riyahboka!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Good evening yes am around now
07/11/23, 8:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, can you please help me in understanding more about how is it that you are planning to proceed with your admission process?
07/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 289 9378: For us we said it’s important for us to see the results first . Then we can start the admission process
07/11/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask, how would getting the results first be helping you in the admission process?
08/11/23, 6:09 am - +263 78 786 2520: So that we can be motivated if the results have come out alright
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/11/23, 7:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand the importance of receiving the results first for motivation, as it's essential for the admission process. However, I'd like to highlight another crucial aspect to consider in this situation. While waiting for the results, there's a possibility that this delay might have certain implications.
08/11/23, 7:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: The concern here is related to the Endowment Plan Benefits and the potential financial challenges you might encounter if the admission process is delayed. It's true that waiting for the results may provide motivation, but there's a risk of losing out on the financial advantages available now.
08/11/23, 7:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: The Endowment Plan Benefits include the $150 Grant as well as the option to make the payments in two parts that might not be available later if the admission process is postponed. This could potentially result in facing financial hurdles in completing the admission at a later time, especially if these current benefits are no longer accessible. I hope you understand?
08/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
08/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Ok maybe let us say we pay on January
08/11/23, 9:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Like I mentioned earlier, the Endowment Plan Benefits that you are getting here are only available for now, and later on by the month of January, the academic board might as well close them. I hope you understand?
08/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
08/11/23, 9:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. On that note, can you please let me know what do you wish to do considering that the benefits won't be availble for much longer?
08/11/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 786 2520: We will still pay in January
09/11/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/11/23, 1:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if you wish to do that, you can surely go for the same, however, being your admission officer, I would still advise you towards not doing the same, since it is only for your benefit.
09/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 289 9378: Thank you for the advice , we are also weighing those options if we don’t get good results what next
14/11/23, 9:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.
14/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes thank you
14/11/23, 9:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, since you were weighing the options earlier, can you please let me know if you were able to plan about how do you wish to move aheadw ith the admission process?
14/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Let’s proceed with the other steps we are about to finish paying our school fee
14/11/23, 10:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. On that note, how are you preparing to complete your admission process as well?
14/11/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 786 2520: We will start budgeting after finishing the school fee
15/11/23, 6:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/11/23, 6:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
15/11/23, 7:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know that you are planning to complete the registration fee after the school fee. And on that note, if I may ask, by when are you planning to complete that as well?
15/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 786 2520: End of November
15/11/23, 7:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, can you please also clarify that if you are mentioning about paying the registration fee end of November or the school fee?
15/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 786 2520: School fee <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, if I may ask, by when do you think you would be able to raise the registration fee as well?
15/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Maybe end of December
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. I understand that. Now, I am glad to hear that you are now ready to take a step forward towards making sure that Riyaboka's higher education can be made possible, however, on that note, I would also like to mention that you may as well face challenges in the financial end since the Grant as well as financial benefits that you are getting now would not be available in December. If I may ask how would you be navigating that sitaution as well?
15/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 786 2520: We will see it through
15/11/23, 9:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask, have you thought about that as well, since it would only be increasing the financial challenges for you, right?
15/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
15/11/23, 9:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, in that case, don't you think the better option would be to work on a payment plan and take things in control as you would wish to so that we can get the financial benefits and complete Riyahboka's admission timely as well?
15/11/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 786 2520: It is but money is not that easy to find especially for civil servants
15/11/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I do understand that and in that situation I do wish to help you with a payment plan that might suit your situation here. Shall we discuss that now?
15/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Ok
15/11/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, since you are wishing to move ahead with Riyahboka's admission process, how do you think of a monthly payment plan that you can follow until you complete the admission and only pay a certain amount every month towards the fee?
15/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 786 2520: And how much will be that
15/11/23, 9:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: About that, we would only be able to draft a plan that is comfortable to you once you will share about the amount that you are comfortable in paying per month towards Riyahboka's registration fee?
15/11/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Ok
15/11/23, 9:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263787862520 May I know if you were able to understand what I tried to say here?
15/11/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
15/11/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: So, can you please let me know of your thoughts on that as well?
15/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 786 2520: It is something
15/11/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you well here, can you please come again?
15/11/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 786 2520: It’s a great idea that we can think about
15/11/23, 9:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, can you please also let me know of the amount that you are comfortable in raising on a monthly basis that we can use for Riyahboka's registration fee? <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 10:41 pm - +263 78 786 2520: $50
17/11/23, 7:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?
17/11/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 786 2520: No
17/11/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: If I may ask why is that please dear? What happened?
17/11/23, 10:28 pm - +263 78 786 2520: We have no network and had no electricity so our batteries are low
17/11/23, 10:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please. On that note, we will connect with each other here tomorrow to move ahead. Until then, have a blessed night!
17/11/23, 10:42 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Thank you
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?

24/11/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, earlier when we had connected with each other here, you mentioned that you are comfortable in raising $50 every month towards your registration fee, right?

24/11/23, 6:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, since it has been quite some time since we had that discussion, may I know how have you progressed towards raising your registration fee?
24/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 786 2520: We will be updating in December but we have started
24/11/23, 8:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that, however, for us to be able to work on a payment plan and put it into place, it is important that we have clarity on the situation, right?

24/11/23, 9:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, on that note, are you certain that you would be able to work on the $50 per month payment plan and complete the registration fee?

25/11/23, 10:22 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Riyahboka!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/11/23, 10:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, let us assume that you have paid $50 this month to start your registration process, then how much amount do you think you would be able to raise in the coming month to contribute towards that?
25/11/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 786 2520: We are planning on paying the full amount on April
25/11/23, 12:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, as we had already discussed, are you wishing to let go of the Endowment Plan Benefits as well as the $150 Grant that you can get now?
25/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 786 2520: Yes
29/11/23, 12:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents and Riyahboka!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Thank you for sharing the confirmation with me here and I will share the same information with the admissions team as well as the academic board forward so that they will be helping you with the same.
29/11/23, 12:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, I wanted to share an important update with you here that today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
29/11/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as the Head of Admissions, Ms. Vilsha, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer. <This message was edited>
