So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
10/10/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Hello...
10/10/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I am Uyvett Mujuru and am happy to be joining the sessions from now on
10/10/23, 7:00 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I am prepared
But I might have a bit of trouble joining you for each and every session with my final exams coming up ..
10/10/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now, and I shall be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM for further progress in our session for the admission process. Have a great day ahead, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well!
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Yes
12/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 279 8193: We are very clear
12/10/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)

The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
12/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I understand
12/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Yes sure.....I understand
12/10/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
12/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I don't have any questions
12/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 279 8193: And I ve been greatly enlightened.. thank you
12/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
12/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
12/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Yes we are on the same page
12/10/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
12/10/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
12/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I am ready
12/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
12/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
12/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
12/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 279 8193: i have reviewed all the above points
12/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply. Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan - <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
12/10/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
13/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Good afternoon
13/10/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
13/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I am available
13/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 279 8193: We may proceed
13/10/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
13/10/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
13/10/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 279 8193: It indeed does
13/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
13/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 6:53 am - +263 78 279 8193: Yes
14/10/23, 6:53 am - +263 78 279 8193: I understand
14/10/23, 8:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Uyvett.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session? <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 279 8193: I am available
14/10/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 279 8193: We may proceed
14/10/23, 9:18 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/10/23, 9:18 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/10/23, 9:18 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/10/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 279 8193: That is very convenient
14/10/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 279 8193: Oh...I understand
14/10/23, 9:24 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 279 8193: No ...I understand
14/10/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 279 8193: I am not familiar with the assessment process
14/10/23, 9:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 9:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
14/10/23, 9:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
14/10/23, 9:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
14/10/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 279 8193: Oh that sounds good
14/10/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 279 8193: Oh I understand
14/10/23, 9:56 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/10/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 279 8193: The program is very convenient
14/10/23, 9:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/10/23, 9:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/10/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 279 8193: The solution is very clear
14/10/23, 10:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
14/10/23, 10:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 279 8193: We are clear
14/10/23, 10:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/10/23, 10:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 279 8193: I understand
14/10/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 279 8193: Yes please
14/10/23, 11:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Uyvett's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Uyvett is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
14/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 279 8193: Yes I am
14/10/23, 11:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Uyvett application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
14/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 279 8193: Okay we made proceed
14/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 279 8193: May*
14/10/23, 11:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
14/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 279 8193: Very well
14/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 279 8193: Thank you
14/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 210 4454: Good afternoon,as Uyvett  s parents we went through your discussions with her and understand every step and how it works,once again thank you have a nice weekend
17/10/23, 11:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Uyvett,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am Ms. Vilsha, and I serve as the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. We have some incredible news to share with you and your family!

18/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I have gone through the letter
18/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I do have a few queries
18/10/23, 8:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am glad to hear that you have noted the queries down @263782798193, please go ahead and share the queries you have on your mind so that we can help you address them and see how best we commence today's discussion.
18/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 279 8193: May u please explain the scholarship details
18/10/23, 9:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, as we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 9:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Yes we may proceed
18/10/23, 10:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. Now that we are all set to discuss Uyvett's offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 10:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s Uyvett's per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/10/23, 10:31 pm - +263 78 279 8193: 1,..…900USD
18/10/23, 10:31 pm - +263 78 279 8193: 2,.....3years
18/10/23, 10:33 pm - +263 78 279 8193: 3,....300USD
18/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I don't quite understand the last question
18/10/23, 10:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That is alright, let me help you with the same. As outlined in Uyvett's offer letter, her course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling six semesters for her degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means her annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/10/23, 10:35 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Yes it does
18/10/23, 10:38 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased that we have been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/10/23, 10:38 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/10/23, 10:38 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, Uyvett can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- Uyvett will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist her in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, Uyvett as a student can also look for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/10/23, 11:28 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I understand
19/10/23, 8:48 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263782798193. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. 

Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
19/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 279 8193: Yes...it is clear
19/10/23, 11:34 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. Continuing the discussion regarding Uyvett's offer letter, now as you can see in the offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
19/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 279 8193: We are clear
19/10/23, 11:45 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to Mazvita's overall cost of education.
19/10/23, 11:45 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your *deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on October 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
19/10/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 279 8193: So my parents are supposed to pay $750 within in the next few weeks otherwise the scholarship ain't secured????
19/10/23, 11:55 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263782798193, a regular international student is supposed to do the same to secure the scholarship. However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Uyvett through Edoofa and the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that she is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 279 8193: Yes....I would like further explanation
19/10/23, 12:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Let me help you here. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Uyvett's behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/10/23, 12:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Uyvett's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Oh okay...I understand
19/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 279 8193: We are clear
19/10/23, 12:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that @263782798193. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, I would also like to move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 12:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Yes .. Harare
19/10/23, 12:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/10/23, 12:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/10/23, 12:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Very well thank you
19/10/23, 12:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
19/10/23, 12:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 11% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
19/10/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Yes please
19/10/23, 1:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please. If that was a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
19/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Thank you very much
19/10/23, 1:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur for Austin at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
19/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Very well I understand
19/10/23, 1:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established Uyvett's total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.
19/10/23, 1:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/10/23, 1:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
19/10/23, 1:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 279 8193: It is clear
19/10/23, 2:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263782798193. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Uyvett with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
19/10/23, 2:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of her annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
19/10/23, 2:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how Uyvett can effectively make her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
19/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 279 8193: It it indeed very helpful
19/10/23, 2:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Correct @263782798193. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Uyvett will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education. Her mentors will undoubtedly provide her with valuable guidance to help her reach her academic and financial goals.
19/10/23, 2:13 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 279 8193: No
I don have any queries
19/10/23, 2:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
19/10/23, 2:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
19/10/23, 2:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
19/10/23, 2:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
19/10/23, 2:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
19/10/23, 2:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities. This virtual tour provides you with a unique opportunity to explore the campus online and gain insights into the university's infrastructure and amenities. 

You can access the virtual tour through this link: [Galgotias University Virtual Campus Tour](https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour).
19/10/23, 2:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: These resources are designed to help you familiarize yourself with the university and its academic environment, even when physical visits are not possible.

19/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 210 4466: Good day. I was just following on the conversation and noted that this is but one offer that you sent. I would prefer to compare various offers since India has so many universities.  I have just looked at but one university. Do we not have the liberty to compare and contrast what is offered they cannot all be homogenous. Thank you
19/10/23, 3:07 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good day to you as well, @263772104466.

I hope this message finds you well. I am glad to see that you've been following the conversation, and I appreciate you sharing your query. Addressing your concern:

The assumption you have made is not accurate. This is, in fact, the first university that has accepted Uyvett's application for a scholarship. It's a significant achievement for her because this university is ranked among the top 100 universities in India. Allow me to help you understand how the university admission process works, so we can address the concern you've raised more effectively.
19/10/23, 3:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As you know Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
19/10/23, 3:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As of now, Uyvett's application has been accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared her application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others. 

Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I hope we are together with this?
19/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 210 4466: Thanks for the clarity. Whilst I might not be well informed about the various universities, what I know for a fact is there are quite many.  would have liked a situation were we can compare so as to understand what options differ and have an idea of the operating environment within India.
19/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 210 4466: Also i have noticed the payment deadlines, are they not flexible. You had clarifies issues earlier on how the amount can be reduce and paid in two instalment. We did not anticipate the application response to be that swift. Would prefer to pay between November and December as we have other commitments. How can you assist in that case?
19/10/23, 8:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @263772104466 and I resonate with your perspective. Our goal is to ensure that Uyett gets the best of the options and hence, as you know each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, in that case, there is a transfer option. 

Let us say, you wish to wait for an update from University A, and in the same process, you end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias University. With this, Uyett would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias University and wouldn't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with such a situation, the transfer option comes into play. Are you aware of that?
19/10/23, 8:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, regarding this question, rest assured that I have taken note of it, and I will address it once we have resolved the first issue you raised.
20/10/23, 10:21 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Uyvett,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. In our conversation yesterday, we were in the midst of addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission and the scholarship offer letter from Galgotias University.

However, halfway through our discussion, we did not receive a response from your end, and consequently, I have been expecting a reply from you. Could you please confirm if you had the opportunity to go through my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
20/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Good morning
20/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Yesterday you were addressing my father's queries on the payment plans and I was going to wait until you were through so that we could continue
20/10/23, 7:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, @263782798193, to continue with our discussion, I was expecting a response from you and your family. Since we didn't receive one, I reached out to check if we were still connected. In my previous message, I also mentioned that we would discuss the query regarding the payment plans after addressing the first query. Were you able to review my previous message where I mentioned the same?
20/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 210 4454: Yes we are still connected and we can continue with our discussion regarding the payment plans
20/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 210 4454: I think for now since some of the universities can take time to respond we can deal with the one which gave us offer letter   so that Uyvett would not lose out the scholarship from Galgotias University
20/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Yes I reviewed the message
20/10/23, 8:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That is alright, to provide you with a better perspective on the transfer option: You can confidently reserve your scholarship seat at Galgotias University by paying the registration fee without any worries or concerns.

In the future, if you receive a better scholarship offer and decide to change your university, you will have the opportunity to do so without incurring any additional costs.

Alternatively, if you receive another offer letter in the future and find that Galgotias University's offer is still the better choice, you can pursue your education there without losing the entire scholarship. This flexibility ensures that you can make the best decision for your academic journey.
20/10/23, 8:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To illustrate this with an example: Let us assume you have paid $750 to Galgotias University to reserve your seat there. Later on, you received a better offer from University A, where the registration fee is also $750.

If you decide to switch your admission to University A, in that scenario, you would need to pay $750. However, because you had already paid $750 to Galgotias University, this same amount would be adjusted against your fee at University A. Therefore, you would not need to pay any additional money to secure your scholarship seat at University A or to make the switch.

I hope this explanation clarifies the process, addresses your query and provides you with a better understanding of how it works?
20/10/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Yes I understand
20/10/23, 8:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, @263782798193. Before we proceed and address your father's query, could you confirm if the first question has been resolved to your satisfaction or if you require further assistance with it?
20/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 279 8193: It's been resolved
I understand
20/10/23, 10:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to address the query shared by your father, I can certainly see the concern you and your family have. This is something we at Edoofa resonate with. That is the reason, there has been a special gesture of the Endowment Plan that has been granted to students like you, considering the economic challenges in Zimbabwe and the financial priorities parents have in place.

However, it's essential to understand that you are competing for an international scholarship, and students from all over the world are vying for this scholarship seat. Given this, universities have to establish timelines to provide equal opportunities to all students.
20/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I understand
20/10/23, 10:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, if you were to expect the offer letter early next year, in line with the Endowment plan, you would not have a longer timeframe to pay the registration fee of $750, and will have to pay this fee within 15 days.

Furthermore, by securing the scholarship seat now, you are getting the financial benefits we discussed earlier. This basically means your per annum cost of education might be slightly higher in the future, as universities may revise their fee structures.
20/10/23, 10:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: By adopting this approach, you'll be saving on long-term finances. I hope this perspective helps you see the bigger picture, and with some adjustments in your financial preparation, you might be able to work out a plan.
20/10/23, 10:40 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Yes ...I think it is indeed convinient
21/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 279 8193: Good morning
21/10/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 279 8193: Regarding the queries my Father had could theybe addressed a bit later when he is back
He travelled to a remote place and there severe network challenges
26/10/23, 9:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Uyvett,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the messages you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Good evening I hope you have been well
26/10/23, 9:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263782798193, thank you for your concern. Due to the festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In consideration of this, I believe it would be beneficial to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 09:00 am*. By selecting a specific time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. This discussion will provide an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and offering guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 9:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence, for me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
26/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 279 8193: The time is okay
26/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 279 8193: I will available
26/10/23, 9:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your response @263782798193. I am glad to hear that you will be available tomorrow at 9 am. We look forward to our discussion and will be ready to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. If you have any specific topics or questions you would like to address during our discussion tomorrow, feel free to share them here in your admission group overnight, and we will make sure to cover them tomorrow.
26/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 279 8193: Very well thank you
03/11/23, 1:55 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Uyvett,

I would like to extend my appreciation for your patience. I was occupied in a series of meetings with the university officials as we were concluding the admissions for the month of October. Unfortunately, this kept me from being available to connect with you.
03/11/23, 2:00 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that you and your family are in good health. I have reviewed your previous message and based on the last feedback and from your end, it seems that the timing of the offer letter and the payment deadline took you by surprise, and you had initially expressed a more comfortable payment period between November and December. 

To address this, we reached out to the university to discuss the possibility of extending the payment period and providing you with more time to arrange the necessary funds. In light of the same, we have a piece of good news to share with you.
03/11/23, 2:01 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Considering the challenges we have had in connecting with each other. I would like you to share the time that you are confident you will be able to connect with the admissions team to discuss your offer letter and plan your university admission. Whether it's tomorrow or today, we are here to assist you in moving forward with your academic journey.
03/11/23, 8:11 am - +263 78 279 8193: Oh I understand
Have you been well
03/11/23, 8:12 am - +263 78 279 8193: Oh alright

25/11/23, 10:31 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to connect with me here earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding Uyvett's admission process.

28/11/23, 12:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. On that note, I would like you to write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with the admission officer and that you are certain about making the payment of the registration fee on 30th November so you are asking them if the Endowment Plan Benefits will still be offered to you. 

Once you are done with writing the mail, please let me know.
28/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 072 9798: Okay thank
28/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 072 9798: You
29/11/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Uyvett!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Following our last conversation, I had informed the academic board that you would be sharing the mail with them shortly, and they were waiting for your email regarding the confirmation of the payment plan as well as the date of making the payment. However, as it wasn't sent in a timely manner and considering the imminent closure for the current round of applications that will be taking place by tomorrow, I personally took the initiative to have a conversation with the team and university officials on your behalf.

After presenting strong cases and emphasizing the challenges you've encountered, they empathized with your situation. Understanding the circumstances, they have kindly granted an extension for the payment deadline up till 30th November. Hence, it's imperative to proceed with making the payment before the stipulated date.
29/11/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: This extension was secured by showcasing our dedication and efforts on your behalf. It's essential to exhibit our goodwill and ensure that the commitment made on your behalf is upheld.

Please proceed with the payment as agreed upon before the extended deadline. Should you encounter any difficulties or need further assistance, feel free to connect with me at your earliest convenience.
30/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 210 4466: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 5:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Uyvett!
I hope you are doing well today.

Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly. <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 210 4466: Okay
