I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM.

Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.

07/10/23, 11:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Computer Science) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
07/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 78 955 2899: It is sir,  you're very accurate
07/10/23, 11:12 am - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
07/10/23, 11:12 am - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
07/10/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
07/10/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
07/10/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 955 2899: Yes sir I clearly understand that. let's proceed
07/10/23, 11:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
07/10/23, 11:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
07/10/23, 11:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
07/10/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 955 2899: yes sir you're correct
07/10/23, 11:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 955 2899: I'm following
07/10/23, 11:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
07/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 955 2899: yes u did
07/10/23, 11:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
07/10/23, 11:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
07/10/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 955 2899: noted
07/10/23, 11:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
07/10/23, 11:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
07/10/23, 11:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
07/10/23, 11:39 am - +263 78 955 2899: yes sir
07/10/23, 11:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 955 2899: I have another question apart from these if you could allow me to present it
07/10/23, 11:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: yes please @263789552899 ?
07/10/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 955 2899: ok I want to about the registration fee  which you've mentioned that itfor reserving my seat at the university that I would have been offered scholarship.

my question is , is this fee totally different from that $200 we've been asked to pay and it was mentioned that it's for reserving my seat, so can you clarify that
07/10/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand. I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350,  and the $750 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
07/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 955 2899: it's okay thank you,  we can proceed
07/10/23, 11:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
07/10/23, 11:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
07/10/23, 11:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
07/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Yes sir thank you soo much, it would be exciting to get the offer letter
07/10/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct Recall. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
07/10/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
07/10/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
07/10/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
07/10/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Yes Sir we can proceed
07/10/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
07/10/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
07/10/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Recall, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
07/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 955 2899: noted
07/10/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
07/10/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
07/10/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 955 2899: it does explain well
07/10/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
07/10/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/10/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 955 2899: yes sir
07/10/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
07/10/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
07/10/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
07/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 955 2899: No queries,  I understand
07/10/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/10/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 955 2899: please I would like to know more
07/10/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
07/10/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
07/10/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
07/10/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 955 2899: yes sir I'm noticing
07/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/10/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 955 2899: yes
07/10/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263789552899 I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
07/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 955 2899: yes you're correct
07/10/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/10/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/10/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 955 2899: very clear on that
07/10/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
07/10/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
07/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 955 2899: yes sir
07/10/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
07/10/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 955 2899: glad to know that
07/10/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 955 2899: no queries please move forward
07/10/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
07/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 955 2899: yes sir,  very excited
07/10/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
07/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Likewise,  it's been a wonderful time we had
07/10/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that you had a wonderful time. Have a great day and weekend ahead.
07/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 955 2899: likewise
14/10/23, 9:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Recall.

14/10/23, 1:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

14/10/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Recall, you have not answered question number 3 dear, may you please answer that as well. <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 955 2899: $300 ( Waived off under Early Registration)
14/10/23, 1:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
14/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Yes it is sir
14/10/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
14/10/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
14/10/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
14/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Noted
14/10/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
14/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Surely we are on the campus
14/10/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
14/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 955 2899: very clear
14/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
14/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 955 2899: we're good Sir
14/10/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
14/10/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
14/10/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
14/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Yes sir
14/10/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
14/10/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
14/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 955 2899: No I'm not in Harare, I'm residing in Chipinge
14/10/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
14/10/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
14/10/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
14/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Thank you for that
14/10/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was going through your application file and I noticed that you made the payment of your enrollment fee from South Africa using Mama Money, in that case, if you wish to make the payment of your registration fee through the same mode as well you can do that. 

For that, you can let me know when you are ready to make the payment and I will then get the Mama Money order generated for you. Is that clear?
14/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 955 2899: yes it is sir thank you.
14/10/23, 2:26 pm - +27 62 910 6062: Wooow thus great  sir I am so glad to hear such  good  news.

14/10/23, 3:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, as I mentioned that if you are planning to make the payment from South Africa, in that case, you can use Mama Money, I hope you are clear, right?
14/10/23, 3:01 pm - +27 62 910 6062: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 3:02 pm - +27 62 910 6062: Okay  thanks u

14/10/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, in that case, if you wish to make a bank payment, you can do that as well on the details mentioned in the offer letter, I hope this is clear?
14/10/23, 3:20 pm - +27 62 910 6062: No I don't  mean that  .l want to ask for my stop order  money  account  from my bank account  because  the give a period  for processing
14/10/23, 3:21 pm - +27 62 910 6062: Then I will pay by mama money  here the banks  don't  transfer  money
14/10/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. You can use any of the modes that you prefer. Moving ahead, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: /,
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Recall!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed with our discussion here please?
16/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 955 2899: i request some more time as me and my parents are settling something down
16/10/23, 4:58 pm - +27 62 910 6062: Good  evening  sir  .Were fine  but ummm  I thought  there was going  to be  a variety  of universities  for us to compare this seam to be so expensive  .We don't  want  our child  to get  stuck
16/10/23, 4:59 pm - +27 62 910 6062: Because  we're earning  in rands  against  the  US dollar  so I am sorry   this one is too expensive
17/10/23, 1:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Recall!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, I understand that the university might seem expensive to you, however, on that note, I would like to mention that we have also share Recall's application with some other partner universities of ours and we are expecting their response on the same within the coming weeks. Moving ahead, in that situation, are you aware how is the admission process carried out and how can you make sure to secure the seat while waiting for the other offer letters please?
17/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 955 2899: no we are not
17/10/23, 4:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here?
17/10/23, 4:56 pm - +27 62 910 6062: We do understand   your  procols but as we calculated  the expenses  needed  for Recall  to access in the schools  of lndia   thus too much  for us and Recall  is starting  writing  exams  tomorrow  and we have to pay before  the out come  of the results  ummm it's  a blow to us
17/10/23, 4:59 pm - +27 62 910 6062: So thus  why were deciding  to quit  whilst it's  earlier  much better  for Recall  to try  to continue  his academic around  Africa  of which  is home  because   here the prices  are much reasonable
17/10/23, 5:11 pm - +27 62 910 6062: My boss 's child is in the university  of cape town  here in South Africa  but the fees  are much more better  and you said it's  scholarship  and this fees  doesn't  mean  scholarship  I  have to pay a lot
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and reall!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that I completely understand your concern about the finances for Recall's higher education, on that note, I would like to mention that the offer letter that we have received is only the first among the ones that we are going to receive, and if you will make up your mind only on the basis of the first letter, I believe you won't be making an informed decision, right?
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moreover, when it comes to letting Recall pursue his higher education in South Africa, I believe you understand that there is a huge difference between the quality of education that is being offered here in India vs the one that you will get there in Africa, right?
19/10/23, 7:26 am - +263 78 955 2899: yes I know that you are tight
19/10/23, 7:27 am - +263 78 955 2899: we just needed to figure something out and see if anything good comes out
19/10/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Recall!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 7:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 955 2899: that could be difficult Sir, I can't promise to be available but I will try
19/10/23, 7:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Recall!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
19/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Can we talk
19/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Yes I am
19/10/23, 7:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, on that note, can you please also help me in understanding about what is it that you are wanting to figure out please?
19/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 955 2899: ok, I'm sorry to say this. As we sat down with my parents we discussed on the matter of financial stability towards this application which in the same situation led to a lot of questions . 

You know we could not figure out what to do in the case that I failed to obtain  the required results for the scholarship,  we will have to do the procedures for transferring back the money  so why not wait for my results.
19/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 955 2899: I understand there are protocols in things like these but you know we get things from a different a  angle,  I understand the seat reserving fee is to be done and why but I'm not alone in this
19/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Are you still with me
19/10/23, 8:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear, thank you for sharing your thoughts with me here. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that you are being very negative here, if we here at Edoofa have complete confidence in you that you will surely score good, then you should also have the same confidence.
19/10/23, 8:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, if you wish to wait till the coming year, for completing your admission process, then being the Senior Admission Officer here, I would advise you to not do that, since there are several reasons to that. 

1. You would firstly lose on the Endowment Program Benefits that you are getting here. 
2. By the coming year most of the students would have completed their admission processes already and in that case you might not get the same scholarship offers that she is getting now. 
3. Moreover, over the past 5-6 years that I have been helping the students in completing their admissions, I have seen that untimely actions in securing the scholarship often leads the students into getting to a position where they lose out on the scholarship seats entirely as by the time they become ready, the seats are already filled in. 

I hope you would understand the same right?
19/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Yes I get that sir
19/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Thank you for the overview and eye opening, let me see if I along my family members could reconsider this issue
19/10/23, 8:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome please. Now, on that note, I believe you would help your family in understanding the same, right?
19/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 955 2899: Yes  sir
19/10/23, 8:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you are clear till here as well?
20/10/23, 12:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Recall!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion, for now, can you please let me know of the time when we can connect with each other here to proceed with our conversation?
24/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Recall!
I hope you are doing well today.

As you may know, today was Dussehra, a significant festival here in India, and our team was not available due to the holiday. On this auspicious occasion of Dussehra, I also extend my warmest wishes to you and your family. May the festival bring joy, prosperity, and success into your life. ✨

On that note, I would like to schedule a conversation with you at 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our discussion here about your admission process. I look forward to our discussion tomorrow, until then have a blessed evening!

26/10/23, 3:04 pm - +27 62 910 6062: It seems  as if it's  not working  for  both  of us because  Recall  is nò yet started  the university  and the pressure  is to high for me now it's  giving  me depression  and I have  to  concentrate at work  and the dates you are  giving  me I think  maybe  to quit whilst it's earlier much better for  both  of us
26/10/23, 3:07 pm - +27 62 910 6062: What  more now  when  Recall  is in lndia  I might  get into  problem  ummm  I am afraid  I don't  want to  risk because  I will  be  budgeting not knowing  your dates and you don't  give  time  it has to work  according  to your  advantage
26/10/23, 3:31 pm - +27 62 910 6062: Let it pass  I don't think  it's  for Recall  I can't  force things I  will  end up in problem  I will  see other  ways
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and REcal!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 07:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 07.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 7:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Recall!

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 955 2899: hello sir
