14/12/22, 7:24 am - You were added
31/07/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, kindly excuse me for the late reply. May I know if you are available for a session.
01/08/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Tanatswa. How are you doing this evening?
05/08/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 085 5400: I am clear
05/08/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
05/08/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
05/08/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 085 5400: Yes sir
05/08/23, 10:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600 and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
05/08/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 085 5400: Yes, we're also working on The projects, however  Mr Shivjeet, after our last session and today about these universities, my parents have said that they will be sticking to PDM University, they have found themselves comfortable around the idea that we will be going to PDM University, I hope you can understand
05/08/23, 10:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, dear. I understand your inclination toward PDM. I would like to pass the same information on to the academic board as well and request them to process your remaining admission formalities at PDM University. 

As soon as we get an update from the university regarding your admission acceptance letter, we will let you know. In the meantime, we would encourage you to be patient while the university completes your remaining admission formalities.
05/08/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 085 5400: Sure sir, I have a question sir if you don't mind
05/08/23, 11:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, dear. Please ask, I am more than happy to help you.
05/08/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 085 5400: So about our packages, how many bags and kgs are we expected to have
05/08/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 085 5400: We would really want to know what we should pack, that is very important for us not to leave behind
05/08/23, 11:46 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Sure, I understand your concern. For our packages, each student is allowed to carry two bags with a maximum weight of 23 kilograms per bag. It's important to pack efficiently, and we recommend considering essential items such as clothing suitable for the destination's weather, personal toiletries, travel documents, and any specific study materials you might need. For further details I advise connecting with your travel agent, dear.
05/08/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 085 5400: Okay thank you sir, that was really helpful
05/08/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, dear.

31/08/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope this message finds you well.

I am *Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer* at Edoofa. As we gear up for the 2023 intake, I have been diligently reviewing the applications of our prospective students. During this process, your admission file caught my attention, and I'd like to discuss a significant aspect with you.
31/08/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I noticed that you were previously offered a remarkable opportunity by MVN University, presenting a generous 90% scholarship on your tuition fee. However, according to your application, it appears you decided to pursue your education at PDM University. This contrast in choices has prompted me to reach out to you, as I believe this decision holds more potential than meets the eye.

I am eager to explore this further and would like to know if now is a suitable time for us to connect and have a meaningful discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion? <This message was edited>
01/09/23, 12:50 am - +263 78 085 5400: Is it okay if we talk today at 11:00am today
01/09/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Hello
01/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 390 4171: Sorry for diverting you a bit when do intent to sent the opening days ? May you just tell us the month. Again there is need for documentation to prove that they are travelling so that they receive their yellow fever vaccination. Please on that one
01/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 390 4171: Please assist on that👆🏿
02/09/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 085 5400 started a video call
02/09/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 085 5400: ......
05/09/23, 9:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/09/23, 9:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in the arrival of the next batch of students here in India. Now, moving ahead, may I know if we can continue with our discussion here?
05/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 085 5400: My dad was hoping if you would assist us on this
05/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Hello
06/09/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 085 5400: ....
06/09/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Hello there are some questions I need to ask about MVN
06/09/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 085 5400: We're considering MVN we need to ask a few questions
06/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 085 5400: After paying $1000 how much are we supposed to pay after we get there to school. We're supposed to pay $1600 per year so we're supposed to pay 800 per semester is that it
07/09/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/09/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding this, since yo have already paid $750 for PDM, you would only have to pay the remaining $250 to complete the $1000 admission fee. Now, moving ahead, this $1000 will be adjusted in your first year fee, which means you are left with the $600 balance only. Is that clear now?
07/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Will we be paying when we get there or the second semester
07/09/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The balance fee is to be paid when you will arrive here in India please.
07/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 085 5400: I am not following please
07/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 085 5400: You said our school fees is $1600 yearly, which means $800 per each semester and you said $1000 balance you will subtract our fees so for the first semester are we not supposed to be covered
07/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right. However, the fee structure for MVN University is followed as a yearly plan for the first year and from the second year onwards you can make the payment in two parts, one every semester. I hope this is clear now?
07/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Is it possible to pay the remaining $600 on our semester break
07/09/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: That would not be possible Tanatswa, since the balance fee is to be cleared as soon as you will arrive here in India please.
07/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Okay we will give you our decision later, i need to know after paying that 600 There won't be anymore money needed besides exam fees . Will we get food at school and how many students in one room
07/09/23, 4:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Tanatswa, regarding that, I would like to mention that only the accommodation is sponsored by the university, rest the food costs are to be borne by the students themselves please.
07/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 085 5400: We cook on our own
07/09/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding the food, if all the students residing together will prefer self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please.
07/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Sure
07/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 390 4171: Hello how are you
07/09/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 390 4171: It appears you are now short changing us . The costs are building up and expecting us to pay at short notice. Remember I am sending my two daughters. Its so stressing now. All along you have been quiet hoping that everything is in order. Now you are changing the university with extra costs . Uuuu bear with us please
07/09/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that however, if you look at the long term costs, you will see that it is a better option, right?
07/09/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 390 4171: When do you expect them there?
07/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 390 4171: It will also be better for you to spread the balance over a longer period instead of one off payment
07/09/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 085 5400: If we were to choose MVN
07/09/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 085 5400: When will be the last batch
08/09/23, 8:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/09/23, 8:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Once you finalize your admission at MVN University, then after the payment of the balance admission fee of $250 each for you and Jesca, we will move ahead to the VISA Process for you both and you will be coming to India by the end of this month please, is that clear?
08/09/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 085 5400: Let me hear from my father
08/09/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 085 5400: Continue with my admission and my twin sister's jesca Vandirai to MVN
08/09/23, 9:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, we will share the same information with the university officials as well. Moving ahead, as you may recall that the admission fee for MVN University is $1000 and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. 

Now, for both you and Jesca, the amount comes to $500. Hence, can you please help me understand by when do you think you would be able to complete this payment as well so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
08/09/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 085 5400: We will talk to father maybe over the weekend
08/09/23, 9:23 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case Tanatswa, since we would have to complete your admission process first in order to move ahead with your VISA Process and travel arrangements, I would advise you to discuss the same with him as soon as possible. 

Hence, would you be able to do that by tomorrow?
08/09/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 085 5400: I will inform you when my father is back from work
08/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear. Once you are done with that, please let me know.
11/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well today.
11/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask what was the reason that led you to choose PDM over MVN please?
11/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 085 5400: The same reasons as of we discussed a while back, comfortability and financial issues
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well today.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, may I know if you have finalized the same for both Jesca and Tanatswa?
12/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 390 4171: Yes what we would have done for one twin we will be obliged to do the same with the other twin
13/09/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well today.
13/09/23, 1:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update with me here. Now, on that note, I wanted to have a discussion with you here, may I know if we can do that now?
13/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Yes
13/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Of course we can
13/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Now, here I wanted to have a discussion with you about your finances please. Earlier, you had mentioned that the main reason that you do not wish to transfer Jesca and Tanatswa to MVN is that you are facing financial challenges, right?
13/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 390 4171: Yes as there was an increase to the fees which was to be paid in a short period of time that was our challenge
13/09/23, 3:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if you would get enough time to raise the required fee, then I believe it won't be an issue for you right?
13/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 390 4171: We have now opted for PDM I think with that decision we will not face any challenges
13/09/23, 3:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I do get that, however, can you please also let me know of this as well?
13/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 390 4171: Yes of course but I think this issue has been over subscribed why can't we move on. Thank you for the concern
13/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: That won't be the wise decision please, because in that case, you would indeed be relieved of the costs that you have to pay now on an immediate basis, however, you would be bearing a difference of more than $1000 on both Tanatswa and Jesca's per annum costs every year, do you think it would be a good decision to do that?
13/09/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 085 5400: The costs for PDM are okay with us
13/09/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 595 8280: As parents we have opted for PMD and l am sure we are done on this
14/09/23, 9:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well today.
14/09/23, 9:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, I completely get where you are coming from, however, you would also have to understand that the recommendation of MVN University that we shared with you here was based on the experiences that students had over the past few years and that is why the academic board wanted you to opt the same for both of your children. 

Moreover, I would also like to mention that once you would have chosen the university for both of them and when they will arrive here in India, hence, at that time it won't be possible for us to change the university. Therefore, before you finalize your decision, I would like to connect you with Ms. Vilsha, the Head of Admissions so that you can discuss the same with her. For that, can you please let me know what would be the right time when I can conect you with her?
14/09/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 390 4171: If possible make 4pm after work here
14/09/23, 9:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, let me schedule your call with Ms. Vilsha at 04.00 PM CAT Today.
14/09/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 390 4171: Its fine
14/09/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Helloe
14/09/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Good afternoon
14/09/23, 4:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Please!

May I know if you are ready for the call?
14/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Due to network I think an audio call would do.
14/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 085 5400: My father is unreachable so you will talk to me untill he is able to connect
14/09/23, 4:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for giving me the confirmation, Ms. Vilsha will be giving you a call as early as possible.
14/09/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Sure
14/09/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 085 5400 started a call
14/09/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 085 5400: May you send messages the reception is poor here
14/09/23, 7:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa started a call
14/09/23, 7:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tanatswa,

I am Ms. Vilsha, the Senior Admission Officer at Edoofa. We recently had a conversation regarding your university choices, and based on our discussion, here is a summary of the key points. Please confirm if these align with your decisions so that Mr. Milan from our team can assist you with the remaining procedures:

1. You have chosen to finalize Tanatswa and Jesca's admission at MVN University.

2. On Tuesday, you will proceed with the payment of $500. By Thursday, we will work to provide you with the acceptance letter and the bonafide letter required for the visa application process.

3. Following this, the students will initiate their visa application process, and you will work on securing the $850 needed upon their arrival.

4. As we discussed, you may require some time to gather this tuition fee needed on their arrival. Once you can confirm the date by which you will have the necessary funds, we will finalize the students' arrival date and assist them in fulfilling their dream of studying abroad.

Please review these points and let us know if they accurately reflect your intentions. Your confirmation will help us proceed smoothly with the next steps of the admission process.
14/09/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 390 4171: Yaah that is true these are our intentions
14/09/23, 8:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for confirming the same, @263773904171. I will be updating Mr. Milan in our team. He will be connecting with you tomorrow to guide you on the most feasible mode of payment for the fee. If you have any queries, please feel free to share them with us here in the admission group.

On that note, I would like to conclude our discussion for today. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well. <This message was edited>
14/09/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 390 4171: Thank you
15/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/09/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: As per the discussion that you had with Ms. Vilsha earlier on the call, may I know if there is anything that you need to ask or any query that you wish to clear?
15/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 390 4171: My only concern is on management of 850 us to be paid on arrival of my children as I pointed out in our discussion requested for the extension of payment period
15/09/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that, however, I am sure Ms. Vilsha must have given you the assurance that we here at Edoofa do not only focus on getting the students here in India, but once they arrive this side, we also act as their local guardians and this means that if you will be facing any challenges in raising the balance fee, we will be helping you with that as well by putting in the payment plans if required, right?
15/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 390 4171: I am glad to hear that
15/09/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, moving ahead, as you mentioned that you are planning to clear the balance fee of $500 by Tuesday, hence once you do that we will then move ahead to the next steps in your admission journey.
15/09/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 390 4171: Thats fine
18/09/23, 7:12 am - +263 78 085 5400: Can you send the details for the  money transfer
