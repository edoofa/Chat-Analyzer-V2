09/11/23, 12:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Ngaakudzwe!

I would like to let you know that we as a team will not be available from the 9th to the 13th of November and will be available on the 14th, on the occasion of one of our biggest festivals Diwali, also known as Deepavali, which is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 12:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

14/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. Today holds particular significance for us here in India as we celebrate Children's Day, commemorating the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru on November 14th. This day is dedicated to acknowledging and advocating for the well-being and rights of children, fostering an environment that supports their growth and development through various events and activities. Wishing you a joyful Children's Day, I am eager to embark on today's session. With that said, I am ready to take on today's session. Please let me know if you are ready to proceed with the session.
14/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Good evening Mr Shivjeet. Thank you for informing us on this special day in your culture. I am ready for today's session
14/11/23, 6:46 pm - +91 92050 95612: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
19/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet. I apologise for my unavailability. We haven't had  electricity for the past few days.  Could you please clarify whether you are asking for my understanding of the entire admission process or the "offer letter" stage please.
20/11/23, 6:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to connect with you further as it was past my available hours. It is alright. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Good evening Mr Shivjeet. I ma ready to continue with the session
20/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
20/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Yes please
20/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
20/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
20/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Yes, we are very clear
20/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
20/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
20/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Yes l understand. We may continue
20/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
21/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 449 1907: Thank you Mr Shivjeet. I think I fully comprehend the process
21/11/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to connect with you further as it was past my available hours. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
21/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Good evening Mr Shivjeet.. I am ready to proceed
21/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
21/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 449 1907: Yes l understand the process
21/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
21/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
21/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 449 1907: I am proud to be part of the journey with EDOOFA and l'm ready
21/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students.
