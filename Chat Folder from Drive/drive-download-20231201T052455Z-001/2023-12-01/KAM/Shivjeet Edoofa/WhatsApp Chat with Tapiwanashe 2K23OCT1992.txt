02/11/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/11/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
02/11/23, 6:05 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Clear 🙏
02/11/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/11/23, 6:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/11/23, 6:07 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Yes sir
02/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/11/23, 6:10 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Understood i want to how long from now roughly when  to pay the amount
02/11/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The deadlines for the offer letters depend on the universities, but it would be mostly two weeks, and please do not worry as you will be well informed in advance about the deadlines. Please let me know if you are clear to proceed with the session?

02/11/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/11/23, 6:25 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Yes we can continue
02/11/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
02/11/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

I got the fact to get employment you need more than skills meaning you need the correct orientation. 
 I also got the point that Edoofa chooses the right university with correct accreditation for us, universities with correct infrastructure and services for better learning. 
I heard that edoofa has invested its time which more than 10 years in creating this platform and it has become a platform to trust as it has helped many students internationally to achieve their dreams.
02/11/23, 7:40 pm - +27 67 963 4448: I also heard that to be successful under edoofa we need to follow instructions since edoofa is going to be our parent and every parent sometimes put tough rules for the benefit of children at the end . Even if some rules will look tough but at the end we will appreciate and use the skills acquired in future in building our brands or working at an organization
02/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
02/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
02/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
02/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
02/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
02/11/23, 7:44 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Yes I agree and I saw it in the videos
02/11/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
03/11/23, 3:37 pm - +27 67 963 4448: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 3:55 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Entrepreneurship is linked with economic development on the fact that activities of Entrepreneurs leads to economic growth and if economic growth is greater than total population we say the country has experienced economic development. Entrepreneurs play a pivotal role towards economic development since the GDP of a country is made by Entrepreneur's activities. It is on that note that we have a linkage on Entrepreneurs and economic development. For example the income that Entrepreneurs get which is a profit can be used to find GDP using income method which in turn the GDP calculated is used to to measure GDP by dividing GDP and total population and find per capita  GDP , a measure of economic development .countries with Entrepreneurs who make huge profit tend to be developed economically because there is a correlation positively between Entrepreneurship and economic development. Entrepreneurship is the bedrock of economic development as it contributes to the GDP of a country. Governments must must give Entrepreneurs incentives as they lead to economic development
03/11/23, 4:17 pm - +27 67 963 4448: GAAP means generally accepted accounting principles.The GAAP is a set of accounting principles,  concepts and rules companies are required to follow in preparation of financial statements. 
The four principles denotes on cost, revenue,  matching and disclosure of financial statements. GAAP allows uniformity and standardization of financial statements which allow financial stakeholders to make decisions locally and internationally bases financial statements. In terms assets GAAP states that assets should be recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value, meaning we record our assets on the lower value between the two , this is done in line with the prudence concepts. Prudence concept state that assets and revenues must be undervalued while expenses must be overvalued, thus creating a buffer for the business on its revenue and assets.
The GAAP makes companies to match the cost of buying the asset versus the revenue generated by that asset. The GAAP is a set of accounting principles which makes companies to present uniformly their financial statements. On matters disclosure the GAAP allows companies to disclose truthful and correct information so that stakeholders are not misled and it says that every accept of financial statement must be in line with international accounting standards
03/11/23, 4:34 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Accounting standards are generally accepted rules universally.  They allow uniformity in presentations of financial statements . For instance IAS1 provides guidance in presenting information under going concern and accrual basis . The going concern states that the business must operate with the fact that tomorrow it will be operating and also accrua basis in IAS1 states that prepayment of expenses are subtracted in income statement while accruals are added.This is done in order to get a correct expense incurred for that year not expense paid because in income statement we need expenses incurred and revenue earned not revenue received. All this is possible thanks to IAS1. 
The next is IAS2 with gives guidance in valuing things like inventory .The inventory is recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value which goes with the prudence concept which is gazzeted in GAAP. 
Accounting standards are very useful because they give a clear and more understable way when stakeholders are making decisions  as they will not be misled
03/11/23, 4:45 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Q 5. Accounting is the presentation of financial statements periodically while auditing is checking the accuracy of the presented financial statements. Accounting mainly is done by an internal member while auditing is done by an external member. Accounting might not show people some mistakes and things like fraud but when auditing is in place things like fraud are exposed. Auditing is checking every figure presented by accountants in the statements.  Auditing gives accountability to accountant because once variances are discovered you will be accountable. Every financial auditor is an accountant but not every accountant is an auditor. Auditors check accuracy of record presented by accountants to give a true reflection of every amount it the statements

03/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student. I hope you are having a fine evening today. 

I would like to let you know that I will not be available this evening due to an unforeseen event that just came up, requiring my immediate attention. In order to make up for this session, I shall now be scheduling our session for tomorrow morning from 8:30 AM onwards. Please excuse me for the inconvenience. Have a great evening, and please share my warm regards with your lovely family as well.
03/11/23, 7:03 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Noted sir. Thank you
04/11/23, 12:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/11/23, 12:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/11/23, 12:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/11/23, 12:24 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Yes I get that one
04/11/23, 12:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/11/23, 12:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/11/23, 12:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/11/23, 12:29 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Ok I get it
04/11/23, 12:29 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Sorry to interupt. This amount is needed maybe december or january
04/11/23, 12:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The amount will need to be paid after 15 days of receiving the offer letter, and please do not worry, as you will be informed well in advance about the details of the same so that you can prepare your finances in advance.
04/11/23, 12:33 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Ok I see  at least being told in advance
04/11/23, 12:34 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Thank you because i was so worried thought 2 weeks from now
04/11/23, 12:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encopasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/11/23, 12:51 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Yes very important
04/11/23, 12:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
04/11/23, 12:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
04/11/23, 12:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
04/11/23, 12:57 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Yes I see it
04/11/23, 1:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well.

However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on Monday from 3:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 1:23 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Thank you sir 🙏
06/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues. 

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
06/11/23, 2:39 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Yes sir can we start at 6 I'm a bit busy at work
06/11/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that you have work commitments, and I appreciate your flexibility. Starting at 6:00 PM works for me. We'll begin our session at that time
06/11/23, 2:56 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Yes sir it's fine
06/11/23, 5:40 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Evening sir. I think I'm ready
06/11/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
06/11/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $175 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
06/11/23, 6:19 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Ok sir.  So everything is based on the university sate
06/11/23, 6:19 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Date*
06/11/23, 6:24 pm - +27 67 963 4448: I mean so after getting the date from the university I will start paying the 1000 usd
06/11/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "You will be required to pay for the university after the arrival of the offer letter. Am I clear here?
06/11/23, 6:47 pm - +27 64 891 9748: How much time do we have from now up to the  arrival of the offer letter approximately
06/11/23, 6:47 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Also its paid in cash or
06/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You will be given multiple modes of payment, and regarding the exact amount, it will also be relayed to you on the offer letter shared by the universities very soon. So, what shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
06/11/23, 7:11 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Yes
06/11/23, 7:11 pm - +27 67 963 4448: You can proceed
06/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
06/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
06/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
06/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 7:18 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Ok  I see
06/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
06/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
06/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
06/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 7:21 pm - +27 67 963 4448: That's great I'm just waiting for the offer letter 😍
06/11/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.

It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
07/11/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
07/11/23, 4:12 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Ooh  I see it , so since I submitted the SOP and Alevel results I must wait for the offer letter from university
07/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
07/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
07/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/11/23, 4:30 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Yes I see it . It makes sense
07/11/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
07/11/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/11/23, 5:16 pm - +27 67 963 4448: It makes sense
07/11/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
07/11/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
07/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
07/11/23, 5:36 pm - +27 67 963 4448: It's clear I see everything
07/11/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/11/23, 5:45 pm - +27 67 963 4448: I'm looking at it but the A level results I have them
07/11/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ash yes indeed, thank you for correcting me.
07/11/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/11/23, 6:05 pm - +27 67 963 4448: As for now I don't have queries as I will be checking every aspect again tonight and if i have queries I will come back to you
07/11/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Tapiwanashe's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Tapiwanashe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
07/11/23, 6:35 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Yes I'm  looking forward to the next step
07/11/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Tapiwanashe's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
07/11/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
07/11/23, 6:39 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Understood.  Thank you
07/11/23, 6:41 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Ok thank you very much
27/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Tapiwanashe,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Quest Group of Institutions* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
27/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
27/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐

28/11/23, 8:46 am - +27 67 963 4448: Good morning . I'm free at 2:30 so we can have the discussion
28/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Tapiwanashe. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Thank you for letting me know. Certainly, that works. Please let me know when you are ready to proceed with the session.
28/11/23, 12:40 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Thank you.  Good afternoon.  I think  3:00 might be better due to work circumstances
28/11/23, 1:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding. We're grateful for the opportunity and are eager to discuss the scholarship offer with you. The adjustment to 3:00 PM works perfectly for us given the work circumstances.
28/11/23, 1:05 pm - +27 64 891 9748: 🙏
28/11/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
28/11/23, 4:07 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Afternoon. Yes we can proceed
28/11/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
28/11/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
28/11/23, 4:49 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Ok
28/11/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 5:17 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Tuition fee after scholarship is $1000 . On accommodation I don't understand because it's written twice double and tripple. On registration fee , I'm supposed to pay $500 now
28/11/23, 5:30 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Same applies with me. I ddnt  understand on accommodation
28/11/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 5:59 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Ok meaning we choose between  air cooler and with air conditioning
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct and you can decide upon that later on. Now, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1000.

Along with this, there is a $100 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your uniform fee, library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $100 to the per annum tuition fee of $1000, the total comes out to be $1100.
28/11/23, 6:03 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Can you explain a bit on uniform fee
28/11/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly! The uniform fee typically covers the cost of any specialized attire or clothing required for specific programs or activities within the university. It could include lab coats, uniforms for certain practical classes, or any specialized gear necessary for your field of study.
28/11/23, 6:17 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Ok I see it's clear.
28/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
28/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
28/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $500 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1100  + $500 = $1600. I hope you are clear about this?
28/11/23, 6:28 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Ok I see. Staying outside the campus is better . I opt that one
28/11/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. You can do that too.  Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/11/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/11/23, 6:32 pm - +27 67 963 4448: I get that one
28/11/23, 6:32 pm - +27 64 891 9748: I think  as a parent i would like to understand much about this. Just clarify somewhere somehow summarize
28/11/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.
28/11/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1600 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/11/23, 7:52 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Understood
28/11/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the registration fee of $750 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year's tuition fee, therefore the amount of tuition fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1100 - $750 = $350. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
28/11/23, 8:57 pm - +27 67 963 4448: Yes it's clear
28/11/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

29/11/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, please ask. I am more than happy to help you.
29/11/23, 7:29 pm - +27 64 891 9748: I am a bit lost. It was confirmed in that quest pdf about the payment of US500 with a deadline. Then at last it was 750dollars. Maybe i missed something i need clarity on how we ended up to a total of 750 first payment
29/11/23, 7:30 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Also that 750 strictly no instalment or is there a room of payment plan. Just a plea.
29/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am deleting this message for now and rephrasing it.
29/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $500 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 12th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
29/11/23, 7:59 pm - +27 64 891 9748: Noted thank you 🙏
29/11/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
