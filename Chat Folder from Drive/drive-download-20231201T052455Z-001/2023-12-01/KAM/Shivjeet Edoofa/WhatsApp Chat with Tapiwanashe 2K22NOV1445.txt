10/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 838 7752: Yes Tapiwa started writing his final A-level exams yesterday and will be writing daily for twelve days.

I’m sure after every sitting they go for revisions with their teachers or as groups preparing for the next exam.

I’m Tapiwa’s father.
10/10/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: t's clear that Tapiwanashe may face some difficulties in attending our session due to exam activities. I kindly request both you and Tapiwanashe to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, shall we further proceed with the session?
10/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 71 753 6557: Yes let's proceed
10/10/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to retrieve the above documents?

11/10/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry A-Level (If you do not have the A level Results).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*

11/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 602 0609: <Media omitted>

11/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 602 0609: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 3:39 am - +263 71 753 6557: Tapiwanashe send the required documents as requested as soon as possible
12/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 602 0609: I understand
12/10/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/10/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/10/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 602 0609: Okay thank you
12/10/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/10/23, 4:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 602 0609: Yes it does
12/10/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
12/10/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
12/10/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
12/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 602 0609: I have no questions
12/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
12/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 602 0609: no l am not aware
12/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
12/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
12/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
12/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 71 753 6557: Yes maam
12/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
16/10/23, 10:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unnoticed. With that in mind, I will connect with you at 3:00 PM tomorrow. Have a great night and warm regards to your lovely family.
17/10/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 602 0609: Afternoon
17/10/23, 3:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 602 0609: yes l am ready
17/10/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 602 0609: yes l am
17/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 602 0609: I am clear
17/10/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
19/10/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unnoticed. With that in mind, I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
19/10/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 602 0609: evening
19/10/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: How are you doing today?
19/10/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 602 0609: L am blessed and yourself
19/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I guess I am blessed too. How is the weather over there?
19/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected?@263786020609
19/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 602 0609: yes we are maam
19/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 602 0609: just exited a night prayer sorry
19/10/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 602 0609: I have no queries
19/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Tapiwanashe's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Tapiwanashe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?

16/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed, causing a delay in discussing the offer letter.

16/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 838 7752: Good afternoon ma’am. Yes we are facing power cuts for long hours from morning to late at night most days. Especially in Harare where Tapiwanashe is. But I can confirm that we are interested in the offer and we await his response to you in due course.

I’m his father and we are miles apart. I will urge him to respond earnestly.
16/11/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your response and for sharing the challenges you've been facing with power cuts. I completely understand how such circumstances can disrupt communication. It's reassuring to know of your continued interest in the offer.

21/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hello, shall we proceed?
21/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 602 0609: @918384048513

23/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 753 6557: OK thank you
25/11/23, 8:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Tapiwanashe!

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping for a reply from your end to complete our letter discussion, but it seems that my message may have been overlooked. Allow me to share a tale - a student, much like yourself, embarking on a journey toward higher education abroad. Amidst the bustling days and nights, a pivotal document, the offer letter, stands as the gateway to this dream.

In earnest dedication, I've set aside extra hours this weekend, akin to an adventurer preparing diligently for an expedition, to ensure our conversation reaches its conclusion. Picture this discussion as a treasure map guiding you toward understanding the intricacies of your financial readiness. My sole aim in this quest is not just to secure the offer letter but to ensure a sturdy foundation for your aspirations, carving a path for a brighter future abroad. Your dreams are the compass; let's steer them toward reality together.
26/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 602 0609: Afternoon @918384048513
26/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 71 753 6557: Good day.ma'am as a parent I was waiting to hear from you and continue about the offer later,  unfortunately I lost a close relative whom we buried yesterday but now I'm available may we please continue from where we left , I'm actively waiting to hear from you
27/11/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Tapiwanashe!

I'm truly sorry for your loss, and my deepest condolences to you and your family during this difficult time. I was not able to reach out to you earlier as it was beyond my available hours. With that said, may I know if you are currently active to proceed with the session?
27/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 78 602 0609: Yes we are
27/11/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you would be able to provide me with the above answers?
27/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 602 0609: Okay
27/11/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know by when shalll I expect them?
27/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 602 0609: 1. $1000
2. 4 years (8 semesters)
3. $300
4. $750
27/11/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000* 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
27/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 602 0609: Yes it does
27/11/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
27/11/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27/11/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 71 753 6557: Gooday we are still waiting for your communication  l hope you are doing well  waiting to hear about the offer letter
27/11/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are in the middle of the discussion now. If you are available, shall we proceed with the session?
27/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 602 0609: Yes
27/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 602 0609: Okay sirr
27/11/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
27/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 602 0609: Yes it does
27/11/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
27/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today and have a meaningful converation. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
27/11/23, 11:25 pm - +263 71 753 6557: Goodnight
28/11/23, 1:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Tapiwanashe. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Please excuse me for being late. How are you doing today?
28/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 602 0609: We are doing good sur and yourself
28/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session now?
28/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 602 0609: We are ready
28/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
28/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 71 753 6557: Goodday ma'am am kindly asking for your office to allow us to make the payment in two months thus end of this month and finish month end of December l will not let you down the reason for not being able to make the full payment of 750us once is because l exhausted  or spend some of the money l had at the funeral assisting at the burial of my father in law
Pliz accept my request to pay 350us this monthend  thus this end of week
28/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, as the deadline is today, I am extending it until the end of this month, which is the 30th of November 2023. Now, given the $150 grant from the endowment benefits that we discussed before, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 30th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 30th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
28/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 602 0609: 😳
28/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 602 0609: The 30th of November is the day after tomorrow
28/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 602 0609: @918384048513 sir 
Is it possible for the payment date to be extended to the end of this week
28/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 753 6557: I understand you but the reason is that 30 November is Thursday and for me to be able to reach the bank that will be Friday  because where l work it's out of town  l have to travel to town and l can only try to catch the bank times on Friday
I work in the rural areas and travel to town fridays
28/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 71 753 6557: It's a special request  l have no other means to catch the bank before friday
28/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 753 6557: May you also provide us with the banking details so that am able to send the 300us
28/11/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed correct and mentioned in the admission process session. It is mentioned that it will be required to pay for the offer letter after 15 days of the offer letter. Since we have also received a 15-day margin today, it is not too late. Hence, I am extending the amendment to the end of this month. After that, the University will be closing the round of application.
28/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 753 6557: So you mean Friday is it ok
28/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 71 753 6557: May you kindly forward the banking details
28/11/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Unfortunatly it will be challing to wait till next month as the university will be closing the round of application afther month. Hence, may I know how much were you able to gather to meet the deadline for 30th of November, as after that, the university will be closing the round of the applications? Also, I am ready to share the banking details very soon.
28/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 71 753 6557: If l manage to look around about 200us on 30 November
28/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That would be fine. I shall update the same to the university officials accordingly. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 71 753 6557: We reside outside Harare thus in Chinhoyi but if there is need to bank in Harare we have to travel about 195km
28/11/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/11/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/11/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/11/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
28/11/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/11/23, 10:54 pm - +263 71 753 6557: Noted thanx
29/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parent and Tapiwanashe.

29/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 602 0609: We are blessed and yourself
29/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great thank you for asking. As tomorrow marks the deadline of your registration fees. May I know if you are ready to complete your Letter discussion?
