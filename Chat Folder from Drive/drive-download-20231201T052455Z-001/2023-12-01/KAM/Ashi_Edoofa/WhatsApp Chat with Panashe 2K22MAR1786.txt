11/10/23, 10:54 am - +91 93546 23922: *Urgent Tuition Fee Payment Reminder and Important Warning*
Dear Parents and Guardians,

We hope this message finds you well. We have made several attempts to remind you about the outstanding tuition fees of *$750* 

This message serves as an official warning from the university administration. Failing to settle the outstanding tuition fees will have severe consequences for your child's academic progress. We understand that financial situations can be challenging, and we are committed to assisting you in any way we can. <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 10:54 am - +91 93546 23922: Consequences of not paying fee is *Academic Loss* Students with unpaid fees may not be allowed to attend classes, which will directly impact their education. This absence may result in missing crucial lectures, assignments, and exams. Attendance records would therefore be affected and hence Consistent absences due to unpaid fees can lead to a significant drop in attendance, potentially preventing your child to take up exams and therefore backlogs. Accumulating backlogs can result in additional academic challenges and the imposition of high penalty charges.

We genuinely care about your child's education and well-being, and we want to ensure they have every opportunity to succeed. Therefore, we are issuing this warning in advance to prevent any confusion and to allow you ample time to address the outstanding tuition fees.

Our primary goal is to support your child's academic journey and ensure they receive the education they deserve. Your cooperation is crucial in this regard, and we trust that you will take this warning seriously.

22/11/23, 12:04 pm - +91 93546 23922: Dear Parents,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of utmost importance regarding your child's academic standing at the college.

Despite several reminders and extensive conversations, it has come to our attention that the outstanding fees for your child's education have not been settled. We have made diligent efforts to work with you, engaging in negotiations with the university on your behalf. Regrettably, these efforts have not yielded a resolution, and the outstanding payment remains unresolved.

As a result of the persistent non-payment, the college has taken the difficult decision to block your child's access to classes. This means that, effective immediately, your child will be unable to attend any classes until the outstanding fees are settled.

We understand that financial matters can be challenging, and we have been committed to finding an amicable solution. However, the prolonged non-payment has left us with no alternative but to take this measure.

We urge you to address this matter urgently to ensure your child's uninterrupted academic progress. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. We believe that together we can resolve this issue and continue to support your child's educational journey. <This message was edited>
