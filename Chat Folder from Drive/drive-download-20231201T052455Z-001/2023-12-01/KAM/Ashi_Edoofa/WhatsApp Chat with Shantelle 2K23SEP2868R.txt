11/10/23, 8:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
11/10/23, 8:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

11/10/23, 8:32 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
11/10/23, 8:36 am - +263 78 849 6076: Yes I am

11/10/23, 8:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/10/23, 8:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

11/10/23, 8:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
11/10/23, 8:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

11/10/23, 8:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand the network challenges @263788496076In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect today at 01:00 pm for our next session.

11/10/23, 1:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Shantelle, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
11/10/23, 1:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
11/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Moving on to this vedio, I understood that Edoofa's vision is not only to offer affordable education but to increase the capacity of success for the student and making them standing their grounds
11/10/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
11/10/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263788496076May I know we are still connected?
11/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 849 6076: All the schools under Edoofa are exceptional they offer students the right skills and right attitudes so that it would help them for the coming years
11/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Yes we are
11/10/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
11/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 849 6076: The SOP is the m9st important document where the student would make the first impression to the admission board and to the school you would want to get enrolled,convincing them that you are the right student of the seat
11/10/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
11/10/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
11/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Yes
11/10/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

12/10/23, 2:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263788496076 Are we still connected?
12/10/23, 4:22 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Greetings everyone
12/10/23, 4:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Mrs. Mangwiro, How are you doing today?

12/10/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing great, We are also doing good thank you for asking.
12/10/23, 4:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: On this note, May I kindly know if Shantelle is facing any issue as we are waiting for her response. Kindly share an update with us.
12/10/23, 4:34 pm - +27 74 649 0272: May I ask issue regarding which area
12/10/23, 4:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27746490272 Our session was planned for 12:30 pm today, but Shantelle hasn't participated in the session. I'm concerned about her absence and wanted to check with you if there might be any issues or challenges she's facing.
12/10/23, 4:40 pm - +27 74 649 0272: As this side is the time of the Rain season and worse that in Zimbabwe if it's raining the signals are extremely poor. So yes where I am it's raining and I know it's also Raining In Zimbabwe.
12/10/23, 4:40 pm - +27 74 649 0272: But will continue trying to connect with her again
12/10/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Good evening
13/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27746490272 The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience. <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 2:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
13/10/23, 3:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
13/10/23, 3:27 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
13/10/23, 3:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/10/23, 3:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
13/10/23, 3:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
13/10/23, 3:31 pm - +27 74 649 0272: All reviewed
13/10/23, 3:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
13/10/23, 3:31 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
13/10/23, 3:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
13/10/23, 3:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Shantelle, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. She will be the trailblazer among her peers, firmly positioning her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
13/10/23, 3:48 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
13/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
13/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
13/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/10/23, 3:55 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes noted
13/10/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $850.
13/10/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/10/23, 4:11 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes it did
13/10/23, 4:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
13/10/23, 4:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
13/10/23, 4:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
13/10/23, 4:14 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Not yet
13/10/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
13/10/23, 4:15 pm - +27 74 649 0272: I would like u to inform us
13/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @27746490272  Let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
13/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
13/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
13/10/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
13/10/23, 4:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
13/10/23, 4:18 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
13/10/23, 4:19 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
13/10/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
13/10/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
13/10/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
13/10/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for her exams, and her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
13/10/23, 4:21 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
13/10/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
13/10/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
13/10/23, 4:29 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
13/10/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
13/10/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
13/10/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 4:33 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Not yet
13/10/23, 4:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Shantelle is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
13/10/23, 4:38 pm - +27 74 649 0272: I believe so
13/10/23, 4:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to her chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
13/10/23, 4:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
13/10/23, 4:42 pm - +27 74 649 0272: I will do so if I come across any question after I go over these discussions again
13/10/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, @27746490272 I'll be happy to assist you
13/10/23, 9:07 pm - +27 74 649 0272: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
13/10/23, 9:09 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Let me inform you that the registration is one time payable fees, also as it's included in your tuition fee that's why your total fees is $1350. Now, If your concern is clear, then I have a exciting news to share with you. Kindly do let me know if we can move forward.
13/10/23, 9:09 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Are these👆👆👆 2 messages talking the same thing
14/10/23, 10:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Shantelle, 

I hope you are doing well. Let me help you understand that the registration fees range is between $500 - $1000, which needs to be paid after you receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university. Once you complete this payment then the university will issue the Admission Acceptance Letter which is the proof of your admission. Also, the registration fees is included in your tuition fees, which means that it's not an additional fees. Furthermore, You will have a good clarity once you will receive an offer letter.

18/10/23, 7:42 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Thank you so much and evening to you too
18/10/23, 7:44 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes we are so delightful to know about this developments and we are happy for our Daughter
18/10/23, 7:51 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Are we connected
18/10/23, 8:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @27746490272, we are still connected, please excuse me for the delay in response, I faced an unexpected network challenge. 

However, I am glad that we are together now and we share the same excitement for your daughter. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/10/23, 8:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/10/23, 8:12 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, please. Now that we are all set to discuss your offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
18/10/23, 8:32 pm - +27 74 649 0272: 1. $350
2. $ 0
3. $1600
4. $250
5. $1000
18/10/23, 8:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per Shantelle's offer letter, MVN University has awarded her a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for her course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, she also has been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to her will be free of cost throughout her stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making her education more affordable, isn’t it?
18/10/23, 8:48 pm - +27 74 649 0272: True
18/10/23, 8:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Indeed @27746490272. Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
18/10/23, 8:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that Shantelle's per annum cost of education is $1600.
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
18/10/23, 9:01 pm - +27 74 649 0272: A we still connected
18/10/23, 9:25 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Hello
18/10/23, 10:39 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, please, we are still connected. There seems to be a challenge with the network, causing some delays in our communication, and we apologize for the inconvenience.

In continuation with our discussion regarding Shantelle's offer letter, as you can see in her offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means her total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
19/10/23, 5:51 am - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
19/10/23, 12:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Parents and Shantele. Also, wishing you a very good morning. Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities that are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure - 

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
19/10/23, 12:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how Shantelle can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make her education more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
19/10/23, 12:45 pm - +27 74 649 0272: I did go through the  message
19/10/23, 1:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing to hear that @27746490272. Now that we have established Shantelle's total annual education cost as $2315, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
19/10/23, 1:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
19/10/23, 1:41 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes it's clear
19/10/23, 1:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, please. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Shnatelle with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
19/10/23, 1:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of her annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
19/10/23, 1:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This illustrates how Shantelle can effectively make her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
19/10/23, 2:14 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes it does
19/10/23, 2:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It is indeed reassuring to have a shared understanding, and I have complete confidence in Shantelle's dedication to the EWYL Program. I believe she will work diligently to reduce the cost of her education, and her mentors will offer valuable guidance to help her achieve her academic and financial goals.
19/10/23, 2:21 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, let's turn our focus to the registration fee outlined in Shantelle's offer letter. As mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in her offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after she arrives in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850. 

This fee of $850 will have to be paid in two I hope you are clear about this as well?
19/10/23, 3:11 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes I am
19/10/23, 3:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that @27746490272. This remaining fee of $850 will be required to be paid after Shantelle arrives in India. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $425 and $425, with a six-month gap between them.

The first installment can be paid either before her arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement? <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 3:20 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
19/10/23, 3:21 pm - +27 74 649 0272: But the second installment is it January 2024
19/10/23, 3:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you, @27746490272, for bringing this to my attention. the second part will be due in January 2025. I sincerely apologize for any confusion caused by the incorrect information I shared. To clarify and ensure we are on the same page, I have edited the same mesage. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 3:25 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Is it 2025
19/10/23, 3:41 pm - +27 74 649 0272: A we still connected
19/10/23, 3:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, we are connected and that is absolutely correct @27746490272, the second part of the fee is to be paid in the subsequent semester which will be January 2025.
19/10/23, 4:05 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
19/10/23, 4:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: On the same note, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as October 31st, 2023*.
19/10/23, 4:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Shantelle through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that she is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/10/23, 4:35 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes please
19/10/23, 4:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Shantelle's behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/10/23, 4:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Shantelle's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before October 31st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/10/23, 4:49 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Thank you, @27746490272, for bringing this to my attention. the second part will be due in January 2025. I sincerely apologize for any confusion caused by the incorrect information I shared. To clarify and ensure we are on the same page, I have edited the same mesage.
19/10/23, 4:49 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Shantelle's behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *October 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *November 30th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Is this still the same payment plan or
19/10/23, 4:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct, this is the same messages that I have shared with you above, can you please come again and help me understand your messages better? Maybe I did not get you well.
19/10/23, 5:00 pm - +27 74 649 0272: The first message is saying second part is to be paid / due by January 2025.
While second message says. A subsequent payment of $425 before deadline date of November 30th  2023.
19/10/23, 5:07 pm - +27 74 649 0272: And also this first outlined installment  with the deadline before the October 31st 2023, is it to be payed  and also $1000 Registration fee of the OCTOBER 31ST Deadline
19/10/23, 6:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: @27746490272, it appears there may be some confusion regarding the two components and hence you seem to have misinterpreted the messages. I will provide you with a more clear breakdown by 07:30 PM. It's currently around 09:30 PM here in India, so I will be taking a brief break to have my dinner. Afterward, I will reconnect with you. I appreciate your patience, and I hope you understand that it's been a long day for us.
19/10/23, 6:58 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok thank you
19/10/23, 7:57 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Shantelle,

As promised, I am here to continue our discussion. I would like to confirm if you are also available at this time. Regarding the last question you raised, I have organized the fees and payment timelines in the messages below. Please review them, and when you're ready, we can proceed with our conversation.
19/10/23, 7:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. Registration Fee - $1000 [Deadline Date - 31st October 2023]*

 - After the endowment grant of $150, $850 is to be paid by parents, and it can be paid in two parts of $425 as follows:

 - $425 before 31st October 2023
 - $425 before 30th November 2023
 
Alternatively, the entire fee of $850 can be paid in one part by the first deadline.
19/10/23, 8:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 2. *Per Annum Cost* - The annual cost of education at MVN University for Shantelle is $1600.

*First Year:* For the initial year, there's a one-time payment of sports and miscellaneous fees, totaling $250, in addition to the per annum cost of education ($1600), totaling $1850. At the same time, the $1000 registration fee will be deducted from this total of $1850, leaving a balance of $850. This remaining $850 can be paid in two installments:

- The first part of $425 within three days of arrival (August 2024).
- The second part of $425 in the subsequent semester (January 2025).

Alternatively, you can choose to pay the entire $1325 fee as a single payment by the first deadline.

*Subsequent Years:* The annual education cost of $1600, which includes tuition and accommodation, is to be paid in two parts of $800 each year, on a semesterly basis, in August and January. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 8:14 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Can I sent an audio about the question I have
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @27746490272, you can go ahead and share your thoughts via a voice note as well and as soon as we receive it, I will do my best to discuss the same with you.
19/10/23, 8:48 pm - +27 74 649 0272: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 9:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: No, not at all, Ma'am. You are supposed to make a payment of $850 by the end of December or the end of November and that too in two parts of $425 as per the due dates shared with you. This $850 is the same as the registration fee of $1000, out of which $150 is paid to the university by Edoofa on your child's behalf.
19/10/23, 9:09 pm - +27 74 649 0272: This is more clearer. I thank you now I get it.
19/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am certain with the efforts you have in place, you will be able to secure Shantelle's scholarship seat with MVN University in due time. Also, now that we are clear with the payment plan, I would also like to move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 9:19 pm - +27 74 649 0272: I am in South Africa I have I Visa Card. Also a Mama Money Account
19/10/23, 9:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me, If you wish to make the payment through the Visa card, you certainly can. The payment can be made online through PayPal. Please note that there is a 10% transfer charge for international payments through PayPal. We will assist you with the PayPal invoice one day before your intended payment date to ensure a smooth process.

Additionally, using the Visa card, you can make the payment through Edoofa's website: [https://www.edoofa.com/](https://www.edoofa.com/). The transfer charges for this option are the same as PayPal. You will find the payment button in the middle of the page, as shown in the screenshot below.
19/10/23, 9:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 9:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alternatively, since you are making the payment from South Africa, you have the option to use Mama Money. This method has a 0% transfer charge, and the payment is made in South African Rand (ZAR), making it a convenient choice for you. If you intend to explore this payment option, please let me know, and we will guide you through the process.
19/10/23, 9:51 pm - +27 74 649 0272: I will  use Mama money
19/10/23, 9:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @27746490272, for Mama Money Payments, if you have an account, you can use the same one and we will share the receipt details with you. 

At the same time, if you wish our team to assist you in creating a Mama Money Order for the required amount, we will help you on the same day. 

This order will be in South African rands. Once you receive the order, you'll need to visit a Mama Money point in your area, and you can make the deposit in cash at that store, referencing the Mama Money reference number provided. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 9:54 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
19/10/23, 9:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Ma'am. Now that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 5:14 am - +27 74 649 0272: Sorry it was very late this side and l dose off while still discussing. Morning. Yes I have a Question
20/10/23, 5:15 am - +27 74 649 0272: Firstly will there be any other offers or not.
20/10/23, 5:22 am - +27 74 649 0272: We where checking some universities that side and was very fond with the one Named LPU University, so will there be any chances for then to also send us the letter.
20/10/23, 8:23 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Ma'am

I understand, and there is no need to apologize. We all need our rest, and it is perfectly normal to doze off when we are tired. I hope you are now feeling refreshed and ready to continue our discussion about Shantelle's offer letter. We are here to commence our discussion and address the questions and concerns you have regarding your child's university admission.
20/10/23, 8:46 am - +27 74 649 0272: Morning and yes we can continue although I will be also working I might delay to respond sometimes but I will definitely respond
20/10/23, 9:02 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand and that is absolutely alright. With regards to the query you shared earlier in the morning, let me address the same by helping you reiterate the fact that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship. 

A student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
20/10/23, 9:05 am - Vilsha Edoofa: We understand that you are eagerly waiting for updates from other universities such as Lovely Professional University. However, it is important to note that each university has its own evaluation process and timeline. We will continue to monitor the progress of Shantelle's application with other universities, and as soon as we receive updates, we will inform you immediately. 

In the meantime, as a parent and a student, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. I hope we are together with this?
20/10/23, 9:15 am - +27 74 649 0272: Well understood
20/10/23, 9:34 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together Ma'am. As you know each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say LPU and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN University, Shantelle would lose out on the scholarship from MVN University and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with such a situation, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/10/23, 9:39 am - +27 74 649 0272: No not aware
20/10/23, 9:42 am - Vilsha Edoofa: That is alright Ma'am, let me help you with the same. To provide you with a better perspective on the transfer option: You can confidently reserve Shantelle's scholarship seat at MVN University by paying her registration fee without any worries or concerns.

In the future, if Shantelle receives a better scholarship offer and decides to change her university, she will have the opportunity to do so without incurring any additional costs.

Alternatively, if you receive another offer letter in the future and find that MVN University's offer is still the better choice, she can pursue her education there without losing the entire scholarship. This flexibility ensures that you can make the best decision for Shantelle's academic journey.
20/10/23, 9:43 am - Vilsha Edoofa: To illustrate this with an example: Let us assume you have paid $1000 to MVN University to reserve Shantelle's seat there. Later on, Shantelle received a better offer from let us LPU, where the registration fee was also $1000.

If you decide to switch her admission to LPU in that scenario, you would need to pay $1000. However, because Shantelle had already paid $1000 to MVN University, this same amount would be adjusted against her fee at LPU. Therefore, you would not need to pay any additional money to secure her scholarship seat at LPU or to make the switch.

I hope this explanation clarifies the process, addresses your first query and provides you with a better understanding of how it works?
20/10/23, 9:51 am - +27 74 649 0272: Perfectly
20/10/23, 9:55 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @27746490272, I am relieved to see that we are aligned in our discussions. Before we wrap up our conversation for today, I would like to get deeper into the university you have in mind, - Lovely Professional University. It is undeniably one of the top universities in India, and I can see that you hold it in high regard. I am curious to know what draws you to this particular university. Have you heard favorable feedback from friends or acquaintances who have pursued their education there? <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 11:37 am - +27 74 649 0272: The lecturers of Lovely Professional University there teaching techniques are at top rate. And the University Schedules are all updated and everything about them is on top notch. As a student u will never fill the distance from home.
20/10/23, 11:41 am - +27 74 649 0272: That's what I have head
20/10/23, 12:19 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Afternoon
20/10/23, 1:31 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Are we still connected
20/10/23, 8:59 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Shantelle,

Yes, please, we are still connected with each other. Please excuse me, at the time you replied to my messages earlier, I was occupied with a few meetings with the team, and hence, I could not check your message.
20/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, I was able to go through the message you shared, and thank you for sharing the thoughts and information you have about Lovely Professional University.
20/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The information you have is absolutely correct. LPU is one of the top universities in India, and that is also one of the reasons LPU is a partnered university with Edoofa. In fact, over 200 Edoofians from Zimbabwe came to India in the past two months.
20/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, since LPU is one of the top universities in India, the cost of education there is a bit higher. So when you compare affordability as a metric, MVN University becomes a better fit.
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, let me assure you that we have shared Shantelle's education details with LPU as well. Once we hear an update from their end, we will connect with you and share the same with you so that you both can make a well-informed decision. I hope this gives you a bit more insights?
20/10/23, 9:56 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes and thank you
20/10/23, 10:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. May I know if you have any other query that you have on your mind that you would like ask or any concerns you wish to share?
20/10/23, 10:07 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Not at all for now
20/10/23, 10:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -
