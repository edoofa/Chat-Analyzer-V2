04/08/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear. How are you doing this lovely evening.
04/08/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 759 4595: I'm fine sir, how are you?
04/08/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am good thank you for asking. May I know if you were able to go through the offer letters?
04/08/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes I went through them
04/08/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Shall we proceed with the offer letter form LPU first?
04/08/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes we can
04/08/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To provide you with a better understanding of the offer letter, I would like to assist you in breaking down the fee structure of Lovely Professional University.
04/08/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *On-Campus Accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation plus food Cost = $1675
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with the off-campus accommodation = $3825.
04/08/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Off-Campus accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation Cost = $1000 or less
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with the off-campus accommodation = $3150.
04/08/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you prefer more affordable accommodation and don't want to stay on campus, you can choose off-campus accommodation. The approximate annual cost for off-campus accommodation, including food expenses, is around $1000, you will also have the option to cook your own meals.

To find off-campus accommodation options, you can connect with Edoofians who are already staying off-campus. They will assist you in finding suitable accommodation. If you don't know any Edoofians, we will help you connect with them closer to your arrival date so that they can guide you.

It's important to note that LPU doesn't force anyone to choose the hostel. They encourage students to visit the campus, see the options available, and then decide whether they want to stay on campus or off campus.
04/08/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure your scholarship seat with Lovely Professional University, a registration fee of $700 needs to be paid. However, since you have already paid $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar, $750 of that amount will be adjusted against the registration fee and the remaining tuition fee for the first year. If you choose to change your university, you can transfer your admission without any additional payment. I hope this clarifies the information for you?
04/08/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes it's very clear and understandable
04/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, let me share a few insights into the university with you as well: 

LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
04/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

04/08/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 759 4595: It's wonderful
04/08/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is indeed. Please let me know when you are clear so that we can move on to the next offer letter.
04/08/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 759 4595: I'm very clear
04/08/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 759 4595: We can move on
04/08/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
04/08/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship? 
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
04/08/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Ok
04/08/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 759 4595: 1. $350
2 .$0
3.$1600
4.$125
5.$1000
04/08/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
04/08/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes it is
04/08/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes. Indeed. Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
04/08/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
04/08/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes I'm very clear
04/08/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
04/08/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes I'm clear
04/08/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 759 4595: If I am to choose MNV this means that I be coming to India next year?
04/08/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No, dear. You will be arriving in India in this year of intake which is 2023.
04/08/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Oo ok that's amazing
04/08/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
04/08/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
04/08/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes I'm clear because I have been doing the EWYL program
04/08/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600 and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
04/08/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes I can see
04/08/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed. Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1850, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1850- $1000 = $850.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
04/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes I'm clear Sir. Thank you
04/08/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to secure your scholarship seat with MVN University, a fee of $1000 needs to be paid. However, since you have already paid $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar Group of Institutions, the total of $750 that you paid for your fee at Gulzar Group of Institutions will be adjusted against the registration fee at MVN University and hence you would have to pay the difference in fee which becomes $1000 - $750 = $250.

If you decide to change your university and transfer your admission to MVN University, you will have to make a payment of $250 before the 10th of August. I hope this clarifies the information for you?
04/08/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 759 4595: Yes it does
04/08/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me share some valuable insights about the university with you:

09/09/23, 10:46 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Agutha,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 13th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
09/09/23, 10:47 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
09/09/23, 10:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Agutha 2K23FEB1751*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
09/09/23, 10:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

Furthermore, we are sharing the undertaking form once again. If you have already filled it out, please share the scanned copy with us.
