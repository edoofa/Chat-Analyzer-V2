31/07/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am fine too thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready for the discussion of the offer letters?
31/07/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 607 5764: Yes please.
31/07/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Shall we commence with the offer letter form LPU?
31/07/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 607 5764: Yes please.
31/07/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To provide you with a better understanding of the offer letter, I would like to assist you in breaking down the fee structure of Lovely Professional University.
31/07/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 678 0759: Ok following
31/07/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *On-Campus Accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation plus food Cost = $1675
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with the off-campus accommodation = $3825.
31/07/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Off-Campus accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation Cost = $1000 or less
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with the off-campus accommodation = $3150. <This message was edited>
31/07/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you prefer more affordable accommodation and don't want to stay on campus, you can choose off-campus accommodation. The approximate annual cost for off-campus accommodation, including food expenses, is around $1000, you will also have the option to cook your own meals.

To find off-campus accommodation options, you can connect with Edoofians who are already staying off-campus. They will assist you in finding suitable accommodation. If you don't know any Edoofians, we will help you connect with them closer to your arrival date so that they can guide you.

It's important to note that LPU doesn't force anyone to choose the hostel. They encourage students to visit the campus, see the options available, and then decide whether they want to stay on campus or off campus.
31/07/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure your scholarship seat with Lovely Professional University, a registration fee of $700 needs to be paid. However, since you have already paid $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar, $750 of that amount will be adjusted against the registration fee and the remaining tuition fee for the first year. If you choose to change your university, you can transfer your admission without any additional payment. I hope this clarifies the information for you?
31/07/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 678 0759: Yes
31/07/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, let me share a few insights into the university with you as well:
31/07/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
31/07/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you yesterday, we were unavailable due to the celebration of Rakhi, a significant and cherished festival in our culture.

Rakhi holds great importance in our lives, as it's a time when we come together as a family to celebrate the bond between siblings. The festivities and rituals of the day required my full attention and participation, which unfortunately led to my inability to connect with you.

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
04/09/23, 2:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
04/09/23, 2:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Since you are arriving late in the night, once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am and hence you would have to stay inside the airport for your safety in the morning at 10:00, you will have to check out. In the morning, you can meet the Edoofa officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Ashley 2K23FEB0130*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.


5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India <This message was edited>

Dear Parents and Guardians,

We hope this message finds you well. We have made several attempts to remind you about the outstanding tuition fees of *$125* 

This message serves as an official warning from the university administration. Failing to settle the outstanding tuition fees will have severe consequences for your child's academic progress. We understand that financial situations can be challenging, and we are committed to assisting you in any way we can.
11/10/23, 10:53 am - +91 93546 23922: Consequences of not paying fee is *Academic Loss* Students with unpaid fees may not be allowed to attend classes, which will directly impact their education. This absence may result in missing crucial lectures, assignments, and exams. Attendance records would therefore be affected and hence Consistent absences due to unpaid fees can lead to a significant drop in attendance, potentially preventing your child to take up exams and therefore backlogs. Accumulating backlogs can result in additional academic challenges and the imposition of high penalty charges.

We genuinely care about your child's education and well-being, and we want to ensure they have every opportunity to succeed. Therefore, we are issuing this warning in advance to prevent any confusion and to allow you ample time to address the outstanding tuition fees.

Our primary goal is to support your child's academic journey and ensure they receive the education they deserve. Your cooperation is crucial in this regard, and we trust that you will take this warning seriously.
