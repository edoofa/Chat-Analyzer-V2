20/09/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/09/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
20/09/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 878 8948: I'm following
20/09/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
20/09/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
20/09/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Yes I am
20/09/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/09/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Yes maam
20/09/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

20/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Please
20/09/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/09/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
20/09/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
20/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Yes please
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
26/09/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
26/09/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

30/09/23, 3:34 am - +263 71 878 8948: *Qstn 2: Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference between Rights and Civil Rights* .

Rights and duties are two interconnected concepts that play a crucial role in the realm of ethics, law, and social organization. While they are related, they have distinct meanings and implications.

Rights can be understood as entitlements or claims that individuals possess, which are typically recognized and protected by legal systems or moral codes. Rights establish what individuals are permitted to do or possess, or the protections they are entitled to receive from others or the government. They serve as a means to ensure individuals' well-being, freedom, and dignity.

Duties, on the other hand, refer to the moral or legal obligations that individuals have towards others, society, or the state. Duties define what individuals are required to do or refrain from doing in order to uphold the rights and well-being of others. They often arise from social contracts, laws, or ethical frameworks. Duties establish the responsibilities and obligations that individuals must fulfill to maintain a just and harmonious society.

Human rights and civil rights are two distinct categories of rights, each with its own scope and context:

1. Human Rights: Human rights are universal rights that are inherent to all individuals, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, gender, religion, or any other characteristic. They are regarded as fundamental and inalienable, applying to every human being solely by virtue of their humanity. Human rights encompass a broad range of entitlements, including civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. Examples of human rights include the right to life,  equality, freedom of expression, education, and access to healthcare. Human rights are often enshrined in national constitutions, international treaties (such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights), and regional human rights instruments (like the European Convention on Human Rights).

2. Civil Rights: Civil rights, also known as legal rights, are a subset of human rights that specifically pertain to the relationship between individuals and the state or government. Civil rights are the rights that citizens possess in a particular country , which are established and protected by the legal system. They are often associated with the concept of citizenship and include rights such as the right to vote, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, due process of law, and protection against discrimination. Civil rights vary across different countries and legal systems, reflecting the specific laws and values of each society.

In summary, while rights refer to the entitlements individuals possess, duties represent the obligations individuals have towards others and society. Human rights encompass universal entitlements inherent to all individuals, while civil rights are particular rights granted to citizens by the state or legal system of a specific country. Both rights and duties are crucial elements in establishing a just and balanced social order.
30/09/23, 3:34 am - +263 71 878 8948: *Qstn 3:What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney?* 

 A prosecutor and an attorney are both legal professionals involved in the criminal justice system, but they have distinct roles and responsibilities:

1. Prosecutor: A prosecutor, also known as a prosecuting attorney or a district attorney (in the United States), represents the government or the state in criminal cases. Prosecutors are employed by government agencies, such as the district attorney's office or the office of the attorney general. Their primary responsibility is to initiate and conduct criminal prosecutions on behalf of the state or the public.

The role of a prosecutor includes:
* Reviewing evidence ;
* Charging decisions; 
* Presenting the case; 
*Seeking justice .

2. Attorney: An attorney, also known as a lawyer or a legal counsel, is a professional who provides legal advice and representation to individuals or organizations. Attorneys can specialize in various areas of law, such as criminal law, civil law, family law, corporate law, or intellectual property law. Their roles and responsibilities can vary depending on their specialization and the needs of their clients.

The role of an attorney includes:
*Legal representation ; 
* Client counseling ; 
*Case preparation ; 
*Courtroom representation .

While prosecutors are focused on representing the state and pursuing criminal charges, attorneys generally work in private practice or as legal counsel for individuals or organizations, representing their clients' interests in a wide range of legal matters, including criminal defense, civil disputes, business transactions, or personal legal issues.
30/09/23, 3:34 am - +263 71 878 8948: *Qstn 5: What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer ? Please elaborate with an example .* 

1. Analytical and Critical Thinking: As a future lawyer I have a strong analytical and critical thinking skills to analyze complex legal issues, identify relevant facts, evaluate arguments, and develop logical and persuasive legal strategies. This involves the ability to dissect information, spot patterns, and draw reasoned conclusions. For example, when researching a case, a lawyer must carefully analyze statutes, regulations, case law, and other legal sources to form a well-supported legal argument.

2. Communication Skills: Effective communication skills are crucial for being a lawyer. As a lawyer ,one must be able to articulate  ideas clearly and persuasively, both in written and oral form.  As a lawyer one needs to draft legal documents, such as contracts or briefs, communicate with clients, negotiate with opposing parties, and present arguments in court. Strong communication skills enable a laywer to convey complex legal concepts in a way that is understandable and compelling to various audiences. For example nomatter how emotional or how the atmosphere is , I'm good at communicating what is required and it will be heard as it is.

3. Research Skills: As a lawyer ,I possess excellent research skills .As a laywer one  must have such quality to find and evaluate relevant legal information. There is also need to be proficient in conducting legal research using various sources, such as statutes, regulations, case law, legal databases, and scholarly articles. As a laywer I must be able to locate and analyze precedents and legal authorities that support their arguments and provide a solid foundation for their cases.

4. Problem-Solving Abilities: Laywers are often confronted with complex legal problems that require creative and effective solutions. So as a lawyer I must have the quality to adept at identifying legal issues, evaluating potential options, and devising strategies to achieve their clients' goals. For example problem-solving skills involve the ability to think strategically, anticipate challenges, and propose innovative approaches to legal issues.Hence , I have this quality .

5. Ethical Judgment: Lawyers are entrusted with upholding ethical standards and maintaining the integrity of the legal profession. Ethical judgment is crucial for making sound decisions, maintaining client confidentiality, avoiding conflicts of interest, and practicing law with integrity and professionalism. For example , in my high school I was nicknamed 'judge Judy' for being able to solve conflicts due to my ethical judgement quality .

05/10/23, 5:34 am - +263 71 878 8948: *Qstn 4 :Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing , Civil , Corporate or Criminal and why ?*

*The following explained categories  are the most two branches I'm interested  in pursuing in law. 

1) *Corporate Law*:it pertains to the legal framework and regulations governing businesses and corporations . According to my research it involves matters such as corporate formation , governance , contracts , mergers and acquisitions , intellectual property , securities regulation , and more . Corporate lawyers provide legal advice to businesses of all sizes , assist with transactional matters , handle corporate compliance,and represent clients in corporate litigation. 

 *2)Civil law* :  Civil law deals with legal issues and disputes between individuals , businessesor organizations .  According to my research, encompasses areas such as contract law , property law, tort law , family law and more .Civil law focues on resolving conflicts and providing remedies for harm or breaches of legal obligations  .

The reason why I like doing these types of law is that :
1) I am passionate about doing law . When  l was growing up  ,  i used to visit my beloved aunt in another city here in Zimbabwe whom happens to study law . Since she was my favorite , upon everything she does , she was my idol . On the other hand she always brags how interesting her job was, hence I loved it more 
.  Therefore until now  I have always  just wanted to study law with great schools so that I could satisfy my passion as well as being my role model .This is the most pushing factor .
2)Since these branches of law are not mutually exclusive , and many lawyers specialize in multiple areas of transition between different branches throughout their careers , it is also important to note that , this is also the other reason why mentioned that the above are my most two best choices .The reason why I love doing law is that at some point you can pursue all three branches to make a living . 
3) The other reason why I like pursue law is that I have the most required qualities and skills for doing it. Im an analyst with critical thinking , my level of communicating skills are crucial , I research as well as solve problems quickly . This is evident by the position that I had in my high school days . I was a member of junior Parliament of Zimbabwe . Also , even now people calls me with a nickname 'Judge Judy' due to my uniqueness . 
4) The other  last most , but not the least factor why I love pursuing law is that , as a growing young lady in Africa , I have always witnessed how women in my society are downtrodden in all . This has always been going on and it's a disease that have turned on into an ordinary thing that women are inferior  than  man . This  needs to be washed out . Therefore I have also liked to do law so that I can be a *feminist* . Corperate law is the one most branch that can lead me into that path of being an advisor , a counselor , a voice of the unheard , an educater to these societies .

06/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 878 8948: <Media omitted>

It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well.

06/10/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?

06/10/23, 11:12 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Thank you for being patient enough with me maam

I hope you are doing well and excited for the weekend. You're very welcome! I'm here to assist and provide information at your own pace, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
07/10/23, 7:51 am - +263 78 392 5961: Good morning ma'am
07/10/23, 7:51 am - +263 78 392 5961: Yes I am available
07/10/23, 7:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
07/10/23, 8:20 am - +263 71 878 8948: Yes ma'am
07/10/23, 8:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
07/10/23, 8:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
07/10/23, 8:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
07/10/23, 8:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
07/10/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 878 8948: Yes maam
07/10/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 878 8948: I'm following
07/10/23, 8:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
07/10/23, 8:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
07/10/23, 8:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
07/10/23, 8:52 am - +263 71 878 8948: I'm following maam
07/10/23, 8:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent to know. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 9:03 am - +263 71 878 8948: Yes maam
07/10/23, 9:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:


Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
07/10/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 878 8948: Yes maam
07/10/23, 9:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
07/10/23, 9:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
07/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 71 878 8948: I'm following maam
07/10/23, 9:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
07/10/23, 9:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
07/10/23, 9:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
07/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 878 8948: Yes I understood clearly
07/10/23, 9:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/10/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 878 8948: No maam
07/10/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
07/10/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
07/10/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
07/10/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 878 8948: I'm following ma'am
07/10/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.  With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
07/10/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
07/10/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
07/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Yes you can
07/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
07/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
07/10/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Auxillia, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
07/10/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Woooow that's nice
07/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
07/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
07/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Yes ma'am
07/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
07/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 878 8948: I'm getting there
07/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
07/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
07/10/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
07/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Nothing yet maam
07/10/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Not yet ma'am
07/10/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
07/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Yes ,I am ma'am
07/10/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
07/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 878 8948: As for my parents , will check with them if they have any questions.
07/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Thank you Ms Kirti , have a great day
07/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, if you have any queries feel free to ask please have a great day and weekend ahead.

4) $750
17/10/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Auxillia!
I hope you are doing well today. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
17/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Yes it's understandable
17/10/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
17/10/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
17/10/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.

17/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 878 8948: But off campus is cheaper
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Auxillia!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
18/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Yes sir
18/10/23, 1:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
18/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 878 8948: Yes ma'am
18/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 878 8948: So in total it is $1050
18/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 878 8948: May you explain a bit more
18/10/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Now as I have mentioned above, the $300 is waived off, which means that you do not have to pay that, I believe this is understood, right?
18/10/23, 10:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263718788948 May I know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed with our conversation?
19/10/23, 5:54 am - +263 71 878 8948: Good morning sir. Yes we are clear
19/10/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
19/10/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
19/10/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
19/10/23, 11:49 pm - +263 78 392 5961: Oky
19/10/23, 11:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 11:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 11:50 pm - +263 78 392 5961: Yes sir
19/10/23, 11:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
19/10/23, 11:54 pm - +263 78 392 5961: Only the first year or this continues until I finish
19/10/23, 11:55 pm - +263 78 392 5961: Or yearly I will have to earn more credit points
19/10/23, 11:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: This will continue till the end of your course dear. Which means that the support that you will get from the EWYL Program will stay there for the entire duration. I hope this is clear?
19/10/23, 11:55 pm - +263 78 392 5961: Yes sir . Great news✨
19/10/23, 11:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 11:59 pm - +263 78 392 5961: No , if any later on , I will notify them .
20/10/23, 12:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/10/23, 12:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

20/10/23, 12:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
