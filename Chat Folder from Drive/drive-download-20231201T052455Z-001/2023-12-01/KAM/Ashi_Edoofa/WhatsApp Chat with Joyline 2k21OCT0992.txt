I hope you are doing well today.
16/08/23, 2:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier since I was not feeling well and had a high fever and yesterday, it was a national holiday on the occasion of Indian Independence Day! So, all of us were celebrating the joyous day. I appreciate your patience here.
16/08/23, 2:58 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Good day sir how are you
16/08/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, I completely understand that, however, can you please also help me understanding it in a more specific way by letting me know of what is it that your parents are going to do in order to raise the finances for your higher education?
16/08/23, 2:59 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Ooh... I really understand sir and hopefully you are feeling well now
16/08/23, 3:00 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Sir we are currently doing projects now which will help in raising the finances for my education
16/08/23, 4:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, I'm feeling well now, thank you for asking.
16/08/23, 4:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear, I understand that. Now, in that case, I do have an option that I need to discuss with you where you can complete your admission process for now in order to secure your seat with the university and then take a deferment till next year so that you can come to India at that time. I hope this is clear?
16/08/23, 5:04 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir... I understand
16/08/23, 5:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: So, shall we discuss the same now?
16/08/23, 5:07 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes we can
17/08/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/08/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/08/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
17/08/23, 4:58 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Alright sir
17/08/23, 4:58 pm - +27 64 074 5205: How are you
18/08/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/08/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm doing fine dear, thank you for asking. Now, Joyline, shall we move ahead with our discussion now dear?
18/08/23, 3:46 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir we can
18/08/23, 3:46 pm - +27 64 074 5205: I'm doing well thank you
18/08/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, Joyline, since you had mentioned that you are planning to enroll yourself for the coming year, it is completely fine for you to do that, however, being your admission officer, I am suggesting you complete the admission process this year itself and then shift your intake to 2024, because in that case, the benefits that you will get are:

1. The Universities change their fee structure every year, and as a result, there is around a 30-40% increase in the fee every year, so if you won't complete the admission now, the fee will increase and you may face an additional burden. 

2. The universities also change their scholarship criteria every year, so it may happen that you may get a lesser scholarship than what you have got now, and hence, it will further contribute even more becoming a financial burden for you.

I hope you are following?
18/08/23, 3:58 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir l understand and l don't have a problem with pay the whole admission fee this year
18/08/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to hear, so shall we move ahead to plan that so that we can secure your seat with the university for the 2024 intake?
18/08/23, 4:00 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir definitely
18/08/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to know that. Now, Joyline, can you please let me know by when do you think you would be able to pay the admission fee so that we can secure your seat with the university?
18/08/23, 4:04 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Can l please just confirm with my parents and get back to you sir?
18/08/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, you can do that dear. May I know by when shall I expect your response on that Joyline?
18/08/23, 5:07 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Tomorrow morning sir
19/08/23, 12:19 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Good morning sir how are you today
19/08/23, 12:20 pm - +27 64 074 5205: I talked to my parents sir and they want to know the amount of money we are paying and how we are supposed to pay it
21/08/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/08/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I sincerely apologize for the delay in connecting and responding to your messages earlier. Unfortunately, I was not feeling well and faced a serious illness over the past few days. However, I'm on the path to recovery now and am dedicated to assisting you promptly. Thank you for your understanding and patience.
21/08/23, 4:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding the amount of money that you will be required to pay, then it will only be your admission fee, i.e. $1000 to secure your seat at the university. And regarding the point that how will you pay it, then we will discuss about it further in our conversation.
21/08/23, 6:40 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Good day sir how are you
21/08/23, 6:40 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Alright then
22/08/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/08/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Joyline, may I know if you have discussed with your parents regarding the payment of the admission fee so that we can move ahead to have a conversation about the payment modes as well as contnue with the next steps in your admission journey? <This message was edited>
22/08/23, 3:26 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Hello sir how are you doing today
22/08/23, 3:26 pm - +27 64 074 5205: I just want to double check that is the admission fee 1000
22/08/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right the admission fee is $1000 please.
22/08/23, 3:53 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Alright sir thank you
22/08/23, 4:53 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Alright sir... Seeing the rapid change in the admission fee from $ 750 to $ 1000  did the school fees change as well
22/08/23, 4:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear, since this scholarship opportunity is an exclusive 90% scholarship, therefore, the admission fee for the same is a bit higher. However, after the scholarship the costs are well under $1500 per annum.
22/08/23, 4:59 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Oooh!okay okay sir
22/08/23, 4:59 pm - +27 64 074 5205: So how do we the admission fee
22/08/23, 5:05 pm - +27 64 074 5205: So the 1500 covers the accommodation fee as well?
24/08/23, 11:10 am - +27 63 871 4595: Good day Mr Milan ,hope I find you well. I was following your conversation with Joyline concerning her admission fee,may I know total cost before scholarship and after.
24/08/23, 11:10 am - +27 63 871 4595: Also,is the intake next year February or August?
24/08/23, 12:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/08/23, 12:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries here, let me help you with the one by one.
24/08/23, 12:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, when it comes to the accommodation fee, it is also completely sponsored by the side of the university, which means that you do not need to pay anything for the same.
24/08/23, 12:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding the costs of education after the scholarship, regarding that, it would be $1600 per annum please.
24/08/23, 12:23 pm - +27 63 871 4595: Okay thank you sir meaning total amount to be raised its 2600 including admission fee,am I right?
24/08/23, 12:24 pm - +27 63 871 4595: Also can admission fee paid in 4 phases;250 per month until we finish sir?
24/08/23, 12:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please that is where the benefit of being Edoofian comes for Joyline. Now, since she is an Edoofian, the admission fee of $1000 will be adjusted in the first year fee of Joyline, which means that you do not have to pay any additional cost for the same and it is included in the per annum cost of Joyline. I hope this is understood?
24/08/23, 12:29 pm - +27 63 871 4595: Thank you, now I get you, meaning if we manage to pay 1000 admission fee this year,then next year we are only going to pay 600
24/08/23, 12:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. However, since the coming year would be first year for Joyline, and for the first year, the costs are $1850 since it includes various one time expenses as well, however, after that the per annum costs for Joyline's higher education would remain as $1600 per annum please. 

Now this means once the $1000 is paid, then in the coming year, you would only have to pay $850 please. Is that clear?
24/08/23, 12:32 pm - +27 63 871 4595: Yes it's clear now sir
24/08/23, 12:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, in that case, since you are clear about everything, may I know how is it that you wish to move ahead with Joyline's admission process at MVN University?
24/08/23, 12:59 pm - +27 63 871 4595: I had asked you earlier on whether it's possible to pay the amount in four phases of 250 per month,I haven't got reply sir
24/08/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, can you please also help me understand that if you are to pay the admission fee in four parts, then how is it that you would be planning to do that?
24/08/23, 1:16 pm - +27 63 871 4595: Now that everything is clear ,we are planning to start paying 
End of September upto December sir
24/08/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if I may ask why is it that you are planning to pay from End of September please?
24/08/23, 1:20 pm - +27 63 871 4595: We plan to do that sir because we only get our salaries each month end, so  by that time everything will be on the pipeline concerning the budget for admission fee sir.
24/08/23, 1:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to ask that what have you planned for Joyline's higher education as of now? What were you able to raise for her admission process till now please?
24/08/23, 1:29 pm - +27 63 871 4595: For now we have nothing in hand but we have lined some projects and I think by the aforementioned time we will be on the position to be able to fulfill her dreams sir.
24/08/23, 2:19 pm - +27 63 871 4595: We also want to know more about MVN University sir
25/08/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/08/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Sure, we will discuss more about the university as well as the offer letter now, however, before that, when I had a discussion with Joyline earlier, she mentioned that you are well prepared to pay atleast the admission fee as of now, hence if I may ask what happened to that?
25/08/23, 11:58 am - +27 63 871 4595: Good morning Mr Milan, about your conversation with Joyline yes she mentioned that we are prepared to pay the admission because she can see how we lining our project but for now we haven't got the desired results sir
25/08/23, 12:00 pm - +27 63 871 4595: Apart from that we were also thinking that the admission fee is about 600 to 750 from  the previous offer letter sir
29/08/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/08/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I completely understand that. However, in that situation, is there any possibility that you can arrange the admission fee before September month end please?
29/08/23, 5:29 pm - +27 63 871 4595: Good Mr Milan. I hope I found you well.
29/08/23, 5:30 pm - +27 63 871 4595: Well regarding issue of the admission fee, we won't be able to start paying before end of September sir.
31/08/23, 9:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/08/23, 9:29 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand. In that case, can you please let me know how much can you manage to pay towards Joyline's admission fee by September end?
31/08/23, 9:32 am - +27 63 871 4595: Morning Mr Milan. End of September we can manage $250
31/08/23, 10:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, once the $250 is paid, by when do you think you would be able to raise the remaining amount as well?
31/08/23, 10:58 am - +27 63 871 4595: October, November and December
31/08/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Thank you for letting me know of that. Now, moving ahead, you can start preparing to make the payment in September end and once you would be done with that, we will move ahead with the next steps in Joyline's admission journey.
31/08/23, 3:22 pm - +27 63 871 4595: Thank you so much sir
31/08/23, 3:57 pm - +27 63 871 4595: So can we know the name of the university sir where we are going to pay?

I'm fine thanks for asking
01/09/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, before we move ahead, can you please let me know if you have been through the offer letter by now?
01/09/23, 3:55 pm - +27 64 074 5205: We didn't receive any offer letter sir
02/09/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/09/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you were able to check the offer letter that I had shared with you here earlier?
02/09/23, 10:22 am - +27 63 871 4595: Morning sir  ,we are all fine
02/09/23, 10:23 am - +27 63 871 4595: We were not able to check the offer letter because it not appearing on this chat,you send and then delete it
02/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: No, please I have not deleted it at all, let me share it with you here again.
02/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/09/23, 10:25 am - +27 63 871 4595: Thank you sir
02/09/23, 11:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Please go through it once and then let me know when you are done.
04/09/23, 12:42 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Good afternoon sir and everyone!

We went through the offer letter and we also figured out the dates are from 1st week August 2023 to 2028 and those dates have passed so we just wanted to know when l am going to go next year
04/09/23, 3:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
04/09/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding this query of yours, I would like to mention that the dates that are mentioned on the offer letter are tentative dates for the start of this year's intake, which means that the intake would not start exactly at that time. 

On the same note, I would like to mention that MVN University has already released their date of travel and that is in the month of September, specifically within the second-third week.
04/09/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, since you have gone through the letter, I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
04/09/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship? 
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
04/09/23, 4:09 pm - +27 64 074 5205: 1...annum tuition fee after scholarship $350
2.annum accommodation fee$0
3.annum fee after scholarship $1600
4.sports and misc fee $125
5.admission fee $1000
04/09/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
04/09/23, 4:14 pm - +27 64 074 5205: It is sir
04/09/23, 4:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
04/09/23, 4:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
04/09/23, 4:15 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir l totally understand
04/09/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
04/09/23, 4:22 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Totally sir l understand
04/09/23, 4:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
04/09/23, 4:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
04/09/23, 4:28 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir l really understand
04/09/23, 4:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600  and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
04/09/23, 4:32 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir l understand that
04/09/23, 4:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1850, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1850  - $1000 = $850.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
04/09/23, 4:54 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir l understand that
04/09/23, 4:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the admission fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.

However, as per the discussion that we had earlier, you are planning to clear that by the end of this month, right?
04/09/23, 5:00 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir
05/09/23, 4:29 am - +27 63 871 4595: Morning Mr Milan, hope I found you well. I was going through your discussion with Joyline and I think I didn't get you well when you say we are supposed to clear the admission fee end of these month.is that so? My earlier discussion with you I stated that we can pay that amount in four months starting end of September and end in December. How are we going to that now?
05/09/23, 4:30 am - +27 63 871 4595: May you make that clear sir
05/09/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/09/23, 10:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that, however, I believe there is a bit confusion here. When I mentioned that you are going to clear the admission fee by this month end, then by that I meant that you will be clearing the first part towards the admission fee in this month end. I hope this is clear now?
05/09/23, 11:32 am - +27 63 871 4595: Yes it's clear now sir
05/09/23, 11:37 am - +27 63 871 4595: Since we are going to finish the admission in December that means Joyline will attend the intake of August 2024.I'm I correct sir?
05/09/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. Joyline will be going to join the 2024 intake please.
05/09/23, 12:50 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Good afternoon sir.... How are you? 

So for next year is there any early intake besides the August intake
05/09/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear, there is no other intake except for the August intake.
05/09/23, 12:53 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Alright sir
20/09/23, 1:42 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Good day sir ...with the banking details in the offer letter is it possible to make the payment from south africa
20/09/23, 1:42 pm - +27 64 074 5205: If possible how do we do it
20/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is completely possible. However, on that note, if I may ask are you planning to make the payment of your admission fee?
20/09/23, 1:52 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yess Sir
20/09/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. May I know if you are ready to make the payment at present from South Africa?
20/09/23, 2:03 pm - +27 64 074 5205: My mother wants to know how she can make the payment
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, may I know if she is aware of Mama Money please?
20/09/23, 2:44 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Ok l will ask her sir
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Please do and then let me know dear.
20/09/23, 2:50 pm - +27 64 074 5205: She is aware of it but does not know how is works
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can I help you in understanding about that so that you can inform your mother as well?
20/09/23, 3:10 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir
20/09/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Joyline, while making the payment through Mama Money, we would create an order for you with a certain amount that is to be paid, and then your mother can visit any of the Mama Money outlets in South Africa and then make a payment in cash against that order. I hope this is clear now?
20/09/23, 3:12 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir
20/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! So, shall I get the order generated for your mother to make the payment?
20/09/23, 3:14 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Yes please sir
21/09/23, 8:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 8:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Joyline, in order for me to be able to get the order generated for you, can you please let me know of the amount that you wish to pay right as of now?
28/09/23, 9:43 pm - +27 64 074 5205: Helloo sir how are you
28/09/23, 9:43 pm - +27 64 074 5205: $250 sir
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, I believe you had mentioned that you wish to pay the complete admission fee, right?
29/09/23, 10:09 am - +27 64 074 5205: I believe my dad mentioned that they would pay the admission fee in four parts sir not 1000 at once
29/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, kindly excuse me for the confusion here, that message was meant for another student.
29/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are ready to make the payment of the $250 please, so that I can get the order generated please?
29/09/23, 10:10 am - +27 64 074 5205: Alright sir
29/09/23, 10:10 am - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir my mother said she can pay the money tomorrow
29/09/23, 10:13 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case, Joyline, can you please check with her that if she would be able to make the payment today. It is because if I get the order generated today, then by tomorrow, it will get expired. Therefore, I will get it generated only when you would be ready. I hope this is clear?
29/09/23, 10:15 am - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir ...but today she is at work so l think it will be best if you get the order ready tomorrow
30/09/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Joyline!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/09/23, 9:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Joyline, as per the discussion that we had earlier, may I know if I can get the Mama Money Order generated for you now so that you can get the payment of your admission fee done?
30/09/23, 11:48 am - +27 64 074 5205: Yes sir please
30/09/23, 11:48 am - +27 64 074 5205: Good morning
