I think it's a good event that allows us to get to know each other as students and also it gives us an opportunity to meet our mentors which is nice . I think next time everyone who  will be participating that is the coordinators etc should get t shirts so that they can be easily identified because some of them did not have t shirts also it should be held in town so that ti can be easy for everyone to locate and be there  Yes I would love to attend similar events in the future

Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Let me tell you what our main objectives are:  The *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfil all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.  The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.  Did you understand the goals, Phillippa?

124 - 05 Mar 2024 02:41PM - Sharda Edoofa: Perfect! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Let me tell you what our main objectives are:  The *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfil all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.  The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.  Did you understand the goals, Michael?
125 - 05 Mar 2024 02:43PM - +263 78 871 1608: Yes I understood the goals and am sure l am going to get those credits as many as they can be

Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India! 3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!  How does that sound, Michael?

To help you ease out the process of finding which particular schools are already connected with us, we could do a small activity. Why don't you share the list of at least 8-10 schools in your area and I can help you identify the ones that are partnered with us.  This will help us save the resolution time and you can go about connecting with the headmasters of the schools that are yet to be connected with us.

87 - 05 Mar 2024 02:23PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ropafadzo, I hope you are doing well!  Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you for the past few days as the team has arrived back for Harare, I am sure you must be aware of the recent event we had there. However, I am available today and have thoroughly reviewed the last message you shared.
88 - 05 Mar 2024 02:23PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me assist you with your concern regarding the refund, I am sure you must be aware that The enrollment fee you've paid is refundable only if, as an organization, we fail to assist you in securing a scholarship opportunity for your higher education in India. However, this is not the case for you, as you have received a scholarship offer letter from PDM University, making you ineligible for a refund according to our policy.
89 - 05 Mar 2024 02:23PM - Ashi Edoofa: While I'm more than willing to explain this policy in detail, I'm also concerned about your sudden contemplation of giving up on your educational plans. I had a conversation with your counselor the other day, and they mentioned that Ropafadzo was truly inclined towards Mining Engineering and wanted to pursue the same course. After the counseling session and our guidance, we recommended a course that would help her pursue her interests. However, in our recent conversation, you mentioned that she's now planning to pursue Civil Engineering, which is quite surprising as her aspiration is quite different from what she's planning to do now.
90 - 05 Mar 2024 02:23PM - Ashi Edoofa: I believe the concern you have is something different. I'm more than willing to offer my support and help you understand the right way for your daughter. I believe if we have an open conversation, we can together find a solution that aligns with Ropafadzo's aspirations and goals.
91 - 05 Mar 2024 02:29PM - +27 74 513 3207: Okay. But in this case the organisation failed to provide Mining Engineering program

238 - 05 Mar 2024 07:56PM - +260 97 4333579: There are a lot of farming systems in agriculture but here are some. Subsistence farming: This farming system is practiced in many developing countries, including Zambia. It involves growing crops and raising livestock to meet the basic needs of a family or community. The primary purpose is self-sufficiency and food security. Commercial farming:This system is prevalent in countries with advanced agricultural infrastructure and market - oriented economies.It focuses on producing crops and livestock for sale in local and international markets . The goal is to generate profit and meet the demands of consumers. Organic farming:This system is gaining popularity worldwide due to its focus on sustainable practices and avoiding synthetic chemicals.It is used in various regions, including Zambia.Organic farming aims to produce food in an environmentally friendly manner, promoting soil health, biodiversity, and reducing the use of synthetic inputs. Intensive farming:This system involves maximizing production on a limited land area through high inputs of labor, capital and technology.It is commonly used in densely populated regions where land availability is limited.The purpose is to achieve high yields and meet the growing demand for food. Agroforestry: This farming system combines trees, crops, and livestock in a mutually beneficial way. It is practiced in different parts of the world, including Zambia.Agroforestry helps in improving soil fertility, conserving water , providing shade , and diversifying income sources. These farming systems have different uses and cater to the specific needs of communities, markets, and the environmental sustainability.It's fascinating to see how agriculture adapts to various regions and circumstances.

Let me provide you with a recap of our discussions during the seminar:  Since the Zimsec results were released last month, we've been diligently working on your scholarship application to help you secure offer letters from various universities in India, giving you multiple options to choose from.

Should you decide to change your university choice, you can do so with the transfer option, and any registration fees you've already paid will be adjusted accordingly.  Following the university selection, the next step will be to commence your visa application process, which will take place in April 2024l. Our Department of Student Welfare will be in touch with you to guide you through this process.

379 - 05 Mar 2024 12:27PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Good Day Carlos  and family,  We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week.  The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Even before the team returned to India, we were already eagerly planning our next visit, spurred on by the incredible connections and opportunities we secured for the students of Zimbabwe.
380 - 05 Mar 2024 12:29PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: However, before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success.  I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
381 - 05 Mar 2024 12:47PM - +263 77 274 4769: To answer your two questions I connected with Mr Abhinav Gupta and Sir Angad Singh. We had a chance to take pictures and it was indeed motivating the watch the Slice Con' 24 with other students. I see myself working well with my mentors and tackling my academics with great passion till the end
382 - 05 Mar 2024 01:10PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
383 - 05 Mar 2024 01:18PM - +263 77 274 4769: No Enlighten me
384 - 05 Mar 2024 01:21PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Carlos, there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
385 - 05 Mar 2024 01:25PM - +263 77 274 4769: I was able to ask Ms Vilsha and  Mr Jyotishman some questions outside the main hall and I did have my chances used up that time.
386 - 05 Mar 2024 01:31PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: Perfect, Carlos! Now, while I have a plethora of insights from the seminar to share with you, I recognize that we are already approaching March, with academic classes commencing in August. With this timeline in mind, I am keen to hear about your educational plans. Have you and your family been able to discuss your aspirations and next steps for your university education in the past couple of days?",No,Yes

Despite these hefty fees, they lack confidence in their future opportunities. This predicament underscores the importance of informed decision-making in education.
255 - 05 Mar 2024 02:39PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I recall our last visit to Zimbabwe in May 2023, where the exchange rate was 1000 Bonds to 1 USD. Now, in just 10 months, it has skyrocketed to 18000 Bonds. This steep rise significantly has impacted students studying in Zimbabwe, increasing the challenges they face. Were you aware of this exchange rate?
256 - 05 Mar 2024 02:41PM - +263 78 789 9505: Yes ,I was aware of the exchange rate
257 - 05 Mar 2024 02:46PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: I see Praise, and as you're aware, Zimbabwe presents its own set of challenges. Our team experienced firsthand the elevated cost of living and network difficulties, which contribute to the demand of pursuing education abroad.  Additionally, there was a concerning safety incident involving our female staff members in Harare when they were followed by two men at night. While incidents like these serve as sobering reminders, they also highlight the importance of exploring educational opportunities in more stable environments.  What are your thoughts on these challenges, Name? Do you perceive them as common occurrences in Zimbabwe?
258 - 05 Mar 2024 02:56PM - +263 78 789 9505: These challenges are definitely affecting the local education system. As a matter of fact, I came across an article in one of our local papers which said some of our local Polytechnic colleges are facing closure due to lack of infrastructure and skilled manpower. Our colleges are churning out graduates who are not fully equipped and ready for the market. Some of these unemployed graduates are the ones who end up engaging in crime because of economic challenges
259 - 05 Mar 2024 03:26PM - Austin Edoofa Kam: That is quite unfortunate Praise, and I personally wish for you to take a step forward from your current situation and get access to better opportunities. In the quest of doing the same, I had a discussion with the academic board and have been able to discuss some solutions for you and your family that can ensure you are able to pursue your education abroad this academic year.

Along with these tasks, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:  *1. A-Level Result or Letter of Recommendation or Statement of Entry (A-Level).*  *2. O-Level Results*  *3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
120 - 05 Mar 2024 11:30AM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them.
121 - 05 Mar 2024 11:30AM - Dev Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:  1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.  2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.  3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.  4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
122 - 05 Mar 2024 11:31AM - Dev Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves Introduction to the Financial Secure Plan. Hence, could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.

It is possible that there may have been an oversight, and so I wanted to reach out to you and your family directly to confirm.

325 - 05 Mar 2024 04:38PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand please. The Edoofa Financial Secure Plan has been designed to help the students and parents plan their finances in a better way. Starting to save now, even in small amounts, sets the stage for a smoother journey towards academic goals. It's about building a solid foundation for your child's future and it empowers you to make informed decisions and pursue the best options available for your child's academic and personal growth. I hope you agree with me?
326 - 05 Mar 2024 04:48PM - Sidhi Edoofa: If you wish to not continue with the plan, that is also alright please. However, I am sure that you also agree with me when I say that it is important to plan ahead of time, whether it is finances or education or anything else.
327 - 05 Mar 2024 04:49PM - Sidhi Edoofa: In such a case, may I know if you have a plan in mind with which we can achieve our collective goal of saving funds for Bruce's higher education in a timely manner?

It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
212 - 05 Mar 2024 03:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I understand that you are yet to sit for your O-Level examinations. In such a case, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.

214 - 05 Mar 2024 03:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:  1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.  2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, *your subject combination for A Level exams*, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.  3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.  4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
215 - 05 Mar 2024 03:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to inquire by when will you be able to share the letter of recommendation and the rest of the documents with us?

139 - 05 Mar 2024 12:13PM - +260 96 8297698: In the second video I understood that edoofa's vision for students is not only to get them admitted in a university but also to get them employed and build their capacity to hold success from a cup and make it to a gigantic tank  thus  making them  more responsible and independent students <This message was edited>
140 - 05 Mar 2024 12:19PM - +260 96 8297698: In the third video I understood why and how edoofa chose the Universities they work with and they did this by assessing the quality of the teaching stuff as well as the opportunities given to the students, I understood that they invested alot of time to indentify the Universities and came up with the most prestigious universities.
141 - 05 Mar 2024 12:22PM - +260 96 8297698: And in the last video I understood why the statement of purpose is important and this is because it is an opportunity to convince the admission board as well any other school that I am actually eligible for the program or the scholarship and it the opportunity to make the best first impression. <This message was edited>
142 - 05 Mar 2024 12:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.  *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions.  You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
143 - 05 Mar 2024 12:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA‚Äôs vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
144 - 05 Mar 2024 12:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
145 - 05 Mar 2024 12:54PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students‚Äô skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to¬†be¬†considered.
146 - 05 Mar 2024 12:55PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
149 - 05 Mar 2024 01:05PM - Sidhi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

We are aware, that you will also be displeased about our shortcoming.  We wish to thank you for having offered us a wonderful opportunity and time spent with us. Any inconvenience caused is sincerely regretted. However, we are still open for further discussion and will appreciate your advice.  Thanking you for undestanding our challenge.  M. Nyathi Parent

176 - 05 Mar 2024 12:39PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.  *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions.  You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
177 - 05 Mar 2024 12:39PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA‚Äôs vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of tomorrow.
178 - 05 Mar 2024 12:39PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
179 - 05 Mar 2024 12:39PM - Sidhi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students‚Äô skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to¬†be¬†considered.
180 - 05 Mar 2024 12:39PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities we were able to secure for our students, I wanted to check in and see if you were able to attend the seminar?
152 - 04 Mar 2024 11:56AM - +27 61 824 8053: None of us make it to the meeting due to time frame which was so limited
153 - 05 Mar 2024 12:02PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Sarah,  I hope you are doing well today. That's perfectly understandable. I appreciate your candor, and I understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances prevent us from attending events. If I may ask, were there any particular challenges that hindered your ability to join us in Harare?
154 - 05 Mar 2024 12:02PM - Sidhi Edoofa: I am interested in learning more about the challenges you and your family faced that led to your absence at the seminar so that I can do my best to ensure you don't miss out on any of the benefits.

157 - 05 Mar 2024 12:53PM - Sidhi Edoofa: These exclusive interactions have been instrumental in guiding students forward on their educational paths. In the meantime, I am curious if you or your family members had any interactions with students or parents who attended the seminar? It would be enlightening for you to hear their perspectives and understand the overarching experience and benefits they gained from the event so that when you have your call with the team, you know exactly what you need to discuss for your education.

The videos hold an important message which will help you in understanding your admission process and your educational prospects in a much better way. In such a case, may I know if it will be suitable for you if I help you understand the message by the founders right now and you can go through the videos later when it is feasible for you?

146 - 05 Mar 2024 11:16AM - Sidhi Edoofa: Mr. Angad, our founder, talks about how as a new Edoofian, you're embarking on a journey that holds immense promise. In the video, he talks about some examples of Edoofa Scholarship Beneficiaries from the past three years. These are students we've met at airports and colleges, now living their dream lives in India. These students are living their dreams, and their daily smiles reflect their overall life satisfaction, not just gratitude towards Edoofa. They attend classes with confidence, knowing they're receiving a life-transforming education, and their friends congratulate them on their scholarships. Their success brings joy to everyone at Edoofa. <This message was edited>
147 - 05 Mar 2024 11:16AM - Sidhi Edoofa: He then talks about his recent visit to Africa, and how he met students, dignitaries, and the Speaker of Parliament in Ghana. He gained valuable insights into the challenges students face and the education system there. We identified many high-potential students who fit Edoofa's vision - individuals we aim to empower with life-changing opportunities. We also studied successful and unsuccessful individuals within the African community to identify common factors.  We identified people who are not open minded and are not teachable and blame the circumstances and who only wish for things to happen and who themselves don‚Äôt take challenges but the cusp of its neck. And then there are certain other people, people who find success, such people are always open minded, and are willing to go the extra mile. <This message was edited>
148 - 05 Mar 2024 11:16AM - Sidhi Edoofa: He goes on to share an inspiring anecdote about the legendary Steve Jobs, the visionary founder of Apple Computers. At the age of 12, Steve Jobs, intrigued by frequency calculators, reached out to the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, Mr. Bill Hewlett, for spare parts. At that time one of the biggest electronics companies was Hewlett-Packard, HP. Impressed by his resourcefulness, Mr. Hewlett not only provided guidance but also hired Steve as an intern. The key takeaway here is the power of seeking help in the right manner. By enrolling in the program, you've taken a crucial step towards your successful future, and we're here as experts to support you every step of the way. <This message was edited>
149 - 05 Mar 2024 11:17AM - Sidhi Edoofa: The key takeaways from this video are: 1) Ensure you follow instructions diligently. 2) Maintain an open-minded approach as you embark on this journey.
150 - 05 Mar 2024 11:17AM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the above messages that explain the first video, ma'am?
153 - 05 Mar 2024 01:20PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We have been helping students for the last 3 years and there are over 1000 students from Africa who are already here in India and these are those students who followed instructions and is open minded, you know when students share their experiences and stories that Edoofa has got all of this robust systems and processes, the counselling session and the  scholarship is great because Edoofa has their relationship with over 250 schools colleges and universities all across India, and Edoofa is transparent with every process. Our vision goes beyond admission. We understand the importance of employability in today's job market. That's why we offer scholarships, affordable education, and an ""Earn While You Learn"" program. You've already received information about this program. Recently, some of our students including Tiriwashe got their scholarship credits and used it to waive his entire semester tuition fee!  As an Edoofian, you'll benefit from the scholarships and scholarship credits, the Earn While You Learn program, a supportive community of like-minded students, valuable skills gained through part-time opportunities and the brand value of being an Edoofian
154 - 05 Mar 2024 01:20PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Over the past few years, we've observed certain obstacles preventing students from achieving their goals. During my visit to Africa, a student expected a fully-funded scholarship, plane ticket, and admission with low grades. While we understand that circumstances can affect academic performance, potential is more important than past results. However, a positive attitude and willingness to follow instructions are crucial.  Many institutions value our recommendations, built on trust and following established protocols. Bypassing expert guidance or scholarship protocols can hinder your success.  We've encountered students who feel entitled to handouts due to past challenges. While empathy is important, long-term success requires understanding structure, policies, and protocols. This is true for both students and parents. We want to guide you, but ultimately, you must be open-minded, coachable, and attentive to your counsellor's guidance.
155 - 05 Mar 2024 01:20PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Imagine a vast ocean representing the world of opportunities: scholarships, jobs, businesses, or even making a positive impact on society. Now, imagine a cup and a tank. The cup holds a limited amount of water (success) from the ocean, while the tank can hold gallons. This represents two students with different capacities for success.  Taking complete ownership and understanding our vision is key. We want to help you grow your capacity for success from a cup to a tank.
156 - 05 Mar 2024 01:20PM - Sidhi Edoofa: May I know if you were also able to go through the summary of the 2nd video that I have shared above?
157 - 05 Mar 2024 01:51PM - +263 77 336 0264: Yes, I have just gone through it
158 - 05 Mar 2024 02:09PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Now in the 3rd video Mr. Angad talks about the importance of watching the videos. These videos are important because the next step for you is the step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle, which is the University Interaction and we want to make sure that you are prepared enough to interact with the prestigious universities. So the faster or the quicker you watch these videos or read this message, the quicker you will make notes, the quicker you will be prepared. Sometimes when students look at the Edoofa website, they talk to other students, they look at the student‚Äôs video testimonials, they look at the google reviews and they think to themselves that all of these students are happy, they are passing with flying colours, they are living their dreams live, and wonder how exactly is it happening, and what‚Äôs the reason behind it and this video is exactly all about that because you are able to see only the tip of the iceberg, you only able to see one percent of the reason. The real secret behind it is 10 years  of hard work that we have invested into creating these systems and platforms and this entire network has a lot of resources for you so that you can pass with flying colours and live the life of dreams.
159 - 05 Mar 2024 02:11PM - Sidhi Edoofa: For your university experience, quality and ethical practices are our top priorities. We meticulously select universities based on accreditation, faculty qualifications, and the use of English as the primary language. We avoid institutions solely focused on profit and choose those with established reputations and a commitment to education. Our experience has shown that some institutions prioritise profit over student well-being. However, by choosing Edoofa, you can rest assured that you'll be placed in a reputable university that meets our strict criteria and offers the ""Earn While You Learn"" program to enhance your employability.
160 - 05 Mar 2024 02:12PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Beyond academic success, Edoofa prioritizes your employability. We've observed that successful individuals possess not only knowledge but also the right attitude and practical skills. Therefore, we've carefully selected universities that offer the ""Earn While You Learn"" program, giving you valuable work experience alongside your studies. This combination equips you with the necessary skills and confidence to thrive in your future career.  By choosing Edoofa, you can rest assured that you'll be placed in a reputable university that emphasizes employability through the ""Earn While You Learn"" program.

I understand that you are at work and can only be available during your lunch hour i.e., from 1:30 PM onwards. In such a case, we will keep our discussion short during your lunch hours.

78 - 05 Mar 2024 12:12PM - Arshita: Noted, So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.  Do you know how that is done?
79 - 05 Mar 2024 12:15PM - +263 78 854 2368: No l'm not aware of how it is done
80 - 05 Mar 2024 12:15PM - +263 78 854 2368: That's awesome then.
81 - 05 Mar 2024 12:19PM - +263 78 854 2368: The work opportunity that Edoofa offers to students while studying is really great.  So what are the works that it offers?
82 - 05 Mar 2024 12:38PM - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*  The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
83 - 05 Mar 2024 12:38PM - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -* The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as: *Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 *Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.  *Recruitment Partners:-* Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics  *Webinars:-* We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - -Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. -How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi -How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu -It‚Äôs Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje -Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi

13 - 05 Mar 2024 12:03PM - +263 77 769 4991: I have been fascinated by the intricacies of the infrastructure and construction. I have always been motivated by how civil engineers play a pivotal role in shaping the world we live today.Growing up in a rural area, where we lived in clay huts and got water from wells, was normal for me. But when I visited Harare, the capital city of Zimbabwe, everything changed. Seeing tall buildings and having water come out of taps felt like magic. It was so different from the simple life in the countryside, and it made me really want to help modernize my home in Masvingo.  Seeing how things we needed every day could change into modern comforts really stuck with me. It felt like I found a world of exciting opportunities, and that's when I knew I wanted to study civil engineering. I hope that one day, with what I learn from studying civil engineering, I can bring that same feeling of progress and wonder to my rural community in Masvingo.

23 - 05 Mar 2024 02:15PM - Arshita: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*  Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India‚Äôs infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.  There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master‚Äôs degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-  *Structural Engineering* *Architectural Engineering* *Geotechnical Engineering* *Environmental Engineering etc.*  *B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*  Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field.   *Career aspects*  In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.  Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.",No,No

279 - 05 Mar 2024 03:17PM - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please.
280 - 05 Mar 2024 03:17PM - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
281 - 05 Mar 2024 03:17PM - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.  Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.",No,No

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
94 - 05 Mar 2024 09:26AM - +263 77 701 0801: Okay if I were given the opportunity to pursue higher education through a scholarship, I would definitely use what I learn to contribute to the education system in my home country. I believe that international exposure is crucial for developing a well-rounded education system, and I would want to share my knowledge and experiences with my fellow students and educators. I would use my knowledge to develop new teaching methods and curriculums that incorporate international perspectives and best practices. I would also want to create opportunities for more students to study abroad and bring their experiences back to our country. This could be done through scholarships, exchange programs, or other initiatives.
95 - 05 Mar 2024 09:44AM - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Nomakhosi, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?

97 - 05 Mar 2024 10:00AM - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.  I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn‚Äôt it?
98 - 05 Mar 2024 11:38AM - +263 77 701 0801: Yes please

20 - 05 Mar 2024 09:57AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Babongile, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

208 - 05 Mar 2024 11:39AM - Gurvinder: Alright Bridget, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
209 - 05 Mar 2024 11:42AM - +263 77 381 4143: Yes we are responsible for that
210 - 05 Mar 2024 11:47AM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?

214 - 05 Mar 2024 12:22PM - Gurvinder: Bridget as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
215 - 05 Mar 2024 12:27PM - +263 77 481 9660: $1500-$2250
216 - 05 Mar 2024 12:31PM - Gurvinder: Exactly Bridget, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

14 - 05 Mar 2024 12:22PM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15 - 05 Mar 2024 12:22PM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16 - 05 Mar 2024 12:22PM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
17 - 05 Mar 2024 12:22PM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?",No,Yes

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*.

27 - 04 Mar 2024 08:05PM - +263 78 822 6122: The major reason I'm interested in pursuing this dream of mine is that, I want to save people's lives. Because in our country where it seems to be a  shortage of doctors, people are dying, not because the diseases are difficult to cure or to  treat,but it's because they are failing to have immediate medical care. Moreso , I will be able to assist any one who needs immediate help.  Another reason is that, studying medicine has been my burning desire,hence I wanted to be proud of myself one day .

So Spiwe, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program. To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.

13 - 05 Mar 2024 02:50PM - Harmehak: Okay so Kundai, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
14 - 05 Mar 2024 03:45PM - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Kundai!
15 - 05 Mar 2024 05:07PM - +263 78 899 9828: Yes I do

19 - 05 Mar 2024 02:44PM - +263 71 328 3819: My name is Michael T Mwerenga and I'm the eldest child in my family. I have two young siblings. I learnt at Mandedza High School which is a boarding school, both A and O level. I managed to score 9A's and 2B'sat form4  and 15 points ( Mathematics (A), Chemistry (A) and Physics (A) during my A levels. I wish to study medicine and surgeylry and my greatest strengths involve excellent Mathematical skills I also believe  to be a polymath.  My weaknesses as a person are : i am an introvert and I kinda find it hard to play an musical instrument though i haven't  seriously  tried one. I usually  read finance books during my free time or Meditate  on the Bible. But my favourite hobby  is watching  history documentaries.
20 - 05 Mar 2024 02:45PM - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Michael, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!  I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
21 - 05 Mar 2024 02:46PM - +263 71 328 3819: Family background  I am a warm-hearted brother of two young sisters. My father is a police officer at a local police station and my mother works at a beauty shop as a hairdresser. I was born at Seke South Maternity Clinic, after birth, my mother left for South Africa looking for a job and she became a hair stylist. I was left with my father at our modest home in Chitungwiza, Unit J. My father was a student police officer at that time, and his salary was hardly enough to support the family. My mother worked hard beyond the borders and sent necessities to my father's rescue, but to no avail, we constantly had break ins annually, given the neighborhood and absence of an older person to tend the home most of the time. I attended the nearest primary school to our home, Seke 7 Primary School. At my previous high school most of my friends called me a polymath, which brought me back to Benjamin Franklin, Leonardo DaVinci, and Elon Musk, who are some of the greatest polymaths who shaped and are shaping the world with their innovations. In my humble circumstances and despite the challenges of my parents making education a reality for me, I feel I can be able to achieve the best this life can offer. I dream myself becoming one of the greatest and humble anesthesiologist saving the people from complicated during and post-surgery pain. My mother is now back in Zimbabwe given the social upheaval in South Africa, her earnings per month have dramatically decreased and my fathers health has deteriorated in the past 12 months; this all has become greater motivation for me to change my life and my family`s lives!
22 - 05 Mar 2024 02:46PM - +263 71 328 3819: It's  a pleaseure sharing  these things with you.

54 - 05 Mar 2024 04:39PM - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :  *1.

27 - 05 Mar 2024 10:01AM - +263 77 444 6054: Edoofa is a shoolarship program formed by the Ceo of Edoofa Mr Anada Singh. It was formed 10 years ago. It was formed to help students with financial problems who were not able to attend their dreams. It became more active after the covid 19. The program is there to help students paying their fees hence it only forces on two purposes the affordability and employability. When we are saying it is affordable the give you the EWY project. These project will be doing them at the same time learning and earning something
28 - 05 Mar 2024 10:04AM - +263 77 444 6054: It is employble because the project they give you help you to develop your skills and to interact with people so that when you get employed on day you won't have a problem because you have been prepared for it After you have graduated they will help you look for a job
29 - 05 Mar 2024 10:23AM - Harmehak: Well received, however its Mr Angad Singh, now, let me share more about the program with you.

138 - 05 Mar 2024 01:47PM - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
139 - 05 Mar 2024 01:51PM - +263 71 567 0353: Yeah this is really beneficial sir
140 - 05 Mar 2024 01:54PM - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Clearance, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
141 - 05 Mar 2024 01:56PM - +263 71 567 0353: Yeah I'm willing to work hard there is nothing I need more that persuing my dream and this is the chance I have to do whatever it takes

142 - 05 Mar 2024 03:10PM - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
143 - 05 Mar 2024 03:10PM - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
145 - 05 Mar 2024 03:10PM - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
146 - 05 Mar 2024 03:10PM - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
147 - 05 Mar 2024 03:58PM - +263 78 046 2124: Ok yhaa thats affordable so its a great program
148 - 05 Mar 2024 04:00PM - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words @263780462124 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1200-$1800, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
149 - 05 Mar 2024 04:25PM - +263 78 046 2124: Ok thats great to know
150 - 05 Mar 2024 04:43PM - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it‚Äôs been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

421 - 05 Mar 2024 10:24AM - Keshav Edoofa: I shall tell you Mr. Simon, Karen being admitted this year only can reduce her fee as much as she can by putting in the hard work just right after being enrolled in the program as you know through the EWYL program so the burden of further studies will be off by your shoulders It is only upon you to make Karen's future bright by getting her such a prestigious opportunity in her hands so that she can get successful ahead  I also would like to share this with you that we already have a limited number of seats left for our program in this intake and the enrollment fee offer of 350$ will be depleting soon as well and the earlier amount of 750$ will be in place again so I do not want you or Karen to miss this chance to grab her a seat in the program and get the highest quality of education at the most affordable cost compared to anyone elsewhere!

138 - 05 Mar 2024 01:38PM - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
139 - 05 Mar 2024 01:38PM - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

141 - 05 Mar 2024 01:38PM - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
142 - 05 Mar 2024 02:01PM - +263 78 230 4800: Alright I'm following
143 - 05 Mar 2024 02:43PM - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Kate, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

129 - 05 Mar 2024 01:55PM - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.  *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*

Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

178 - 05 Mar 2024 04:21PM - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
179 - 05 Mar 2024 04:21PM - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
180 - 05 Mar 2024 04:21PM - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*

Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.  *Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

290 - 05 Mar 2024 02:32PM - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Farai and Mrs. Memory , you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program.  One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT
291 - 05 Mar 2024 02:33PM - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors  1. Student himself/herself 2. FAMILY 3. EDOOFA PROGAM  Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs.  Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples  *In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*  *In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*  *In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
292 - 05 Mar 2024 02:33PM - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education.  *As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  *_SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST_*  *_Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions._* _*Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole.*_ _*After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.*_  Whey to Go Greek yogurt‚Äîa strained form of cultured yogurt‚Äîhas grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6. outdo A) NO CHANGE B) defeat C) outperform D) outweigh  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE B) can pollute waterways, C) could have polluted waterways, D) has polluted waterway‚Äôs,  8.scientists; and A) NO CHANGE B) scientists: and C) scientists, and D) scientists, and,  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed A) where it is now.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

26 - 05 Mar 2024 10:31AM - Kunal: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program. To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University

28 - 05 Mar 2024 10:58AM - Kunal: Okay so Georgina, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

115 - 05 Mar 2024 10:16AM - +263 77 108 0244: After the discussion with my family we have realised that Edoofa is so helpful and affordable for my academic life. My family would be happy for me if I become a selected student in Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I am always dreaming of studying abroad through this helpful scholarship. We can see that edoofa is affordable especially after looking at the fees of  universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from 650 to $750 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2300 per year. So this shows edoofa is so helpful and affordable. At the same time it makes it easier to be employed after completing the course in India. They were also happy about the carrier that you have guided me to. They are saying it is good and going to be helpful. They really appreciated your effort. They also said they will help me with some finances if l found eligible and they will pay according to the given affordable payment plan

145 - 04 Mar 2024 10:10PM - Pallika Edoofa: Melisa, I've noticed that you haven't been actively participating in our chats, and it's important to emphasize that active engagement is a crucial aspect of this program. Your current level of participation is not in line with our requirements.

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

160 - 05 Mar 2024 12:53PM - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
161 - 05 Mar 2024 12:53PM - Shubham Madhwal: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.
162 - 05 Mar 2024 12:53PM - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
163 - 05 Mar 2024 01:11PM - +263 71 298 0161: Okay noted with thanks
164 - 05 Mar 2024 01:13PM - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

211 - 05 Mar 2024 02:20PM - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
212 - 05 Mar 2024 02:37PM - +263 71 298 0161: Okay that's great
213 - 05 Mar 2024 03:07PM - Shubham Madhwal: Until a few years ago, the cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for the majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, and emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today‚Äôs time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.* <This message was edited>
214 - 05 Mar 2024 03:07PM - Shubham Madhwal: *While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year. Isn't it?*

18 - 05 Mar 2024 01:06PM - Shubham Madhwal: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  1. Scholarships 2. Sponsorships
19 - 05 Mar 2024 01:06PM - Shubham Madhwal: Scholarships make education affordable for students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwe Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.
20 - 05 Mar 2024 01:06PM - Shubham Madhwal: Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time

16 - 05 Mar 2024 12:52PM - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so Nokuthula, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

40 - 05 Mar 2024 02:07PM - +263 77 106 3710: So how many points do I need to obtain at A level if I am doing Arts subjects inorder to do this degree .
41 - 05 Mar 2024 02:31PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
42 - 05 Mar 2024 02:47PM - +263 77 106 3710: Yes ,I am very confident .

273 - 05 Mar 2024 04:23PM - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.  I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

8 - 05 Mar 2024 10:58AM - Shubham Madhwal: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program. To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
9 - 05 Mar 2024 12:41PM - +263 77 277 7823: Noted please can your I brochures and flyers
10 - 05 Mar 2024 12:49PM - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so , as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

89 - 05 Mar 2024 11:28AM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
90 - 05 Mar 2024 11:30AM - +263 78 110 5743: Yes sure

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

21 - 05 Mar 2024 03:07PM - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
22 - 05 Mar 2024 03:07PM - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

10 - 04 Mar 2024 09:47AM - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so sobantu, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.  In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.   Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on) A Level and Previous Results *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. *Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

315 - 05 Mar 2024 11:46AM - Shubham Madhwal: Similar to Sociology, *the field of Law offers a platform to engage with and influence societal issues.* Through a legal education, you can develop a deep understanding of the legal frameworks that shape our communities, allowing you to advocate for justice and contribute to positive transformations.
316 - 05 Mar 2024 11:46AM - Shubham Madhwal: In both Sociology and Law, there is a shared commitment to addressing issues such as poverty, discrimination, mental illness, and substance abuse. The legal profession provides opportunities to work on policies, regulations, and legal interventions that directly impact these challenges. By combining your sociological insights with legal expertise, you can contribute to shaping more equitable laws and policies that address the root causes of social issues.
317 - 05 Mar 2024 11:46AM - Shubham Madhwal: Moreover, the ethical and advocacy components that are integral to Social Work are also highly valued in the legal field. Lawyers often play a crucial role in advocating for marginalized communities, ensuring equal access to justice, and challenging systemic injustices. Your understanding of cultural competence and social justice from Sociology can enhance your ability to approach legal issues with a well-rounded perspective, considering the diverse needs of individuals and communities.
318 - 05 Mar 2024 11:46AM - Shubham Madhwal: As a lawyer, you can work across various sectors, including public interest law, human rights, or even policy research and development. The multidisciplinary nature of law allows you to collaborate with professionals from different fields, including sociology, to address complex societal challenges comprehensively.
