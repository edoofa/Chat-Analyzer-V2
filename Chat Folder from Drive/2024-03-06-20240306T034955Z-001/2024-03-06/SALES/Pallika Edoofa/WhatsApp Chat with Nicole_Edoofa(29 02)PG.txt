*I believe her a deserving candidate!* <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, you can also address that!
29/02/24, 1:16 pm - +27 83 883 8831: Thank you I appreciate. I will ask her to provide the documents soonest
29/02/24, 1:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
29/02/24, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: In the meanwhile, Please address this
29/02/24, 1:39 pm - +27 83 883 8831: I have personally not researched any foreign education. I am not sure if she has applied to any University at the moment. She has the answer to that
29/02/24, 1:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!

01/03/24, 9:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
01/03/24, 9:34 am - +27 83 883 8831: Morning we are good to go
01/03/24, 9:34 am - +27 83 883 8831: Let me provide the documents you asked for
01/03/24, 9:35 am - +27 83 883 8831: <Media omitted>
01/03/24, 9:37 am - +27 83 883 8831: <Media omitted>
01/03/24, 9:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these!
01/03/24, 9:54 am - +27 83 883 8831: Ok. About applying to other universities abroad, she has not , but has done some research
01/03/24, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Sibanda, continuing the session, Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
01/03/24, 9:57 am - +27 83 883 8831: I am pretty confident she will achieve higher. We ( me and her) are hoping for at least 10 points , and even higher
01/03/24, 10:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Sibanda! I am glad that you are having confidence on your child!
01/03/24, 10:20 am - +27 83 883 8831: Thank you
01/03/24, 10:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Sibanda, as your counselor, my role is to provide guidance that benefits both you and your child. Considering Nicole's potential and the financial aspect, I recommend exploring alternative engineering career paths. The BTech Chemical Engineering is a NISCHE course, while valuable, entails annual fees ranging from 2700 to 3700 and offers only a 50% scholarship. Nicole, deserving of a higher scholarship, may benefit more from considering other engineering aspirations.
01/03/24, 10:52 am - +27 83 883 8831: I appreciate your guidance. I will liaise the information to her
01/03/24, 10:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, please!
01/03/24, 7:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session

02/03/24, 10:39 am - +27 83 992 1065: Yes i have
02/03/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, pleas let me know your aspirations in other engineering!
02/03/24, 10:44 am - +27 83 992 1065: well  i think B Tech is a good course  i would persue it but  am  more interested  in Chemical engineering  and Industrial engineering
02/03/24, 10:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: But you see, it is a NISCHE Course, so, do you still want to pursue?
02/03/24, 10:47 am - +27 83 992 1065: Enlighten me about what you mean when  you say NISCHE please <This message was edited>
02/03/24, 10:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, please!
02/03/24, 10:57 am - +27 83 883 8831: Morning. My apologies I wasn’t available. I am available not
02/03/24, 11:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please not that through NISCHE COurse, I would like to inform that it means it is an expensive course whose cost will reanges to 2700-3700 also the scholarship percentage will be limited to 50% only
02/03/24, 11:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Mr. Sibanda!
02/03/24, 11:03 am - +27 83 992 1065: okay  maam
02/03/24, 11:04 am - +27 83 992 1065: per semester or annually??
02/03/24, 11:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: It will be annual fee!
02/03/24, 11:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Nicole, I'd like to point out that given your interest in Industrial Engineering, I suggest you consider pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (BTECH) in Mechanical Engineering. Would you like me to provide a detailed explanation of the course?
02/03/24, 11:07 am - +27 83 992 1065: yes please go on
02/03/24, 11:07 am - +27 83 992 1065: okay
02/03/24, 11:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure!
02/03/24, 11:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
02/03/24, 11:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: *I hope this might aligns with what you are aiming for*
02/03/24, 11:12 am - +27 83 992 1065: yes i think this will enlighten me  a bit
02/03/24, 11:14 am - +27 83 992 1065: am also interested in Aeronautical engineering am into fluid mechanics a lot  am just stating all my options here but hopefully by next year i would have made up my mind
02/03/24, 11:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Nicole, Looking at your interests and passion towards aerosplanes and aeronauticals,let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but as your counsellor I would like to highlight a few parameters

-This is also a niche course which has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low

- If you opt for this branch ,your scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself. At the same time if you opt a degree like *Mechanical Engineering* ,it can help to bridge you to Aeronautical,Aerospace,Automotive etc at the same time helps to fulfull your interests to solve challenges,to bring innovations and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as mother of Engineering!
02/03/24, 11:27 am - +27 83 992 1065: okay is mechanical engineering niche course too
02/03/24, 11:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: No, Please, *B Tech Mechanical Engineering* is not a NISCHE Course as it also offers the scholarship upto 60-100% as well
02/03/24, 11:30 am - +27 83 883 8831: I am quite but following
02/03/24, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is well noted, Mr. Sibanda
