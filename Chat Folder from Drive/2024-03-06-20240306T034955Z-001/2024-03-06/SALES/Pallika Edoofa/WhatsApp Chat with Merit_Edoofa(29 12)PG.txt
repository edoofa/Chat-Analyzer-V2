09/01/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing these, 
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/01/24, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
09/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Oooh that's wonder
09/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 865 4482: *wonderful
09/01/24, 3:01 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Do I guess I qualify for this right
09/01/24, 3:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: kindly be informed that upon successful completion of the interview and eligibility test, and upon meeting the eligibility criteria, a student will qualify, regardless of their A-level results.
09/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 865 4482: That's good to hear
09/01/24, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
09/01/24, 3:11 pm - +263 77 865 4482: I researched a bit about foreign education
09/01/24, 3:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Thank you
09/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Can I ask you something
09/01/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
09/01/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please ask
09/01/24, 3:15 pm - +263 77 865 4482: This is a scholarships program or am going to pay for my fees alone
09/01/24, 3:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
09/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 865 4482: As for transport and accommodation my parents will manage
09/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 865 4482: What is the approximate expense for accommodation
09/01/24, 3:19 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Is it possible for me to work there whilst schooling
09/01/24, 3:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Merit, please note that you have the opportunity to self-finance your higher education through project work. Once you are deemed eligible and successfully enrolled, your admission to the earn-while-you-learn program will commence. This program allows you to earn scholarship credits ranging from 50-100$, which will contribute to a reduction in your tuition fees.
09/01/24, 3:31 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Okay I understand
09/01/24, 3:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!

09/01/24, 3:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Proceeding further, I would like to know that if you were interested in Medical field, so, why haven't you pursue Physics in your A level.
09/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 77 865 4482: I failed it in my Ordinary level
09/01/24, 3:45 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Is physics considered as a necessity
09/01/24, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Merit, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
09/01/24, 3:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field

13/01/24, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
13/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 77 865 4482: Thank you
13/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 77 865 4482: It will make my qualifications for this career strong making me be accepted in any company I apply to world wide
13/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 865 4482: It will also show that my education is not one country based too
13/01/24, 10:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
13/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 77 865 4482: I am not
13/01/24, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/01/24, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: *So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
13/01/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 865 4482: Ye it is
13/01/24, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
13/01/24, 10:46 am - +263 77 865 4482: I don't
13/01/24, 10:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/01/24, 10:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
13/01/24, 10:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
13/01/24, 10:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
13/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 77 865 4482: I would benefit a lot
13/01/24, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
13/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 77 865 4482: That's amazing
13/01/24, 11:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
13/01/24, 12:01 pm - +263 77 865 4482: 3
13/01/24, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

13/01/24, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
13/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Thank you n
13/01/24, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this
13/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 77 865 4482: My mom
13/01/24, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's understandable, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
13/01/24, 2:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Thank you
15/01/24, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greeting Everyone,
How are you doing today?

Kindly excuse the delay as I was occupied in the overwhelming number of applicants after the A-level results in Zimbabwe and their evaluation, 

So, Shall we begin with the session?
15/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 865 4482: How are you
15/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 77 865 4482: What up for today
15/01/24, 1:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session, I would like to know this, please?
15/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 865 4482: They think it is the best for me
15/01/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
15/01/24, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
15/01/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 865 4482: No
15/01/24, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright,  When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
15/01/24, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/01/24, 5:17 pm - +263 77 865 4482: Yes
15/01/24, 5:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
15/01/24, 5:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
15/01/24, 5:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
15/01/24, 5:19 pm - +263 77 865 4482: What if I have 4 points in my Advanced level
15/01/24, 5:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this once!

18/01/24, 6:49 am - +263 77 865 4482: Morning
18/01/24, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin the session?
18/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 865 4482: Sure
18/01/24, 10:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ending our session, Merit, We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
18/01/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 865 4482: Yes
18/01/24, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
18/01/24, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
18/01/24, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
18/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 77 865 4482: I am
18/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 77 865 4482: Wanted to ask about the Visa process
18/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 77 865 4482: This message was deleted
18/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 77 865 4482: Do I pay everything all by my self
18/01/24, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Merit, i have mentioned here!
18/01/24, 10:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this once!
18/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 77 865 4482: Oooh ok I remember and u finally understood the procedure
18/01/24, 10:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: The visa process will be *$83 which is to be borne by the student*. However, we will be guiding you on the same! <This message was edited>
18/01/24, 10:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great!
18/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 77 865 4482: Okay I understand
18/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 77 865 4482: What about the plane tickets
18/01/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 865 4482: How much will I pay
18/01/24, 10:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Merit, If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
18/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 77 865 4482: Ok I understand
18/01/24, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any other queries?
18/01/24, 10:21 am - +263 77 865 4482: I don't
18/01/24, 10:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
18/01/24, 10:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Merit, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
18/01/24, 10:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

19/01/24, 2:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Merit, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
19/01/24, 3:17 pm - +263 77 865 4482: 1 BSc Cardiovascular Technology 
2 India
3 $6000-$8000
4 $2000-$3000
5 $350, 7 days $200 and the remaining $150 in 30 days
6 It is where by a student works while learning in order to help in payment of fees. It makes the student make higher education affordable compared to local universities. It helps in lowering the expenses of living taking for instance your monthly expenses adds up to $100 and when working you earn $1200 the living expenses are covered with the pay you are receiving. There's no limit to the earnings of the student working because the willingness you show whilst working for your employer is the more you earn.
7 I am very clear about that.
