17/02/24, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/02/24, 8:52 am - +263 77 131 4650: Good morning Ms Pallika
19/02/24, 10:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Everyone,
How have you been?
Kindly excuse for the delay, as I was busy with the Africa Trip.
19/02/24, 10:18 am - +263 77 131 4650: Ok its fine
19/02/24, 10:18 am - +263 77 131 4650: How are you today
19/02/24, 10:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also fine!
19/02/24, 10:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: How was your weekend?
19/02/24, 10:23 am - +263 77 131 4650: My weekend was great
19/02/24, 10:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
19/02/24, 10:26 am - Pallika Edoofa: Have you gone through this?
19/02/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 131 4650: Yes I did
19/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 131 4650: I wanted to ask that is this degree far away from Social work? Or its just the same
19/02/24, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Wycliffe, Please note that Engaging in a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Sociology can serve as a direct pathway to a career in social work. While sociology provides a robust foundation in understanding social structures, inequalities, and group dynamics, its theoretical insights and research methodologies can be directly applicable to the field of social work. The analytical skills honed through sociology coursework equip individuals with the ability to critically assess societal issues, identify systemic injustices, and propose effective interventions. Moreover, the empathy and compassion cultivated within sociology programs align closely with the values inherent in social work practice. Through internships, field experiences, or further education in social work, graduates of BA Sociology programs can seamlessly transition into roles where they directly apply their knowledge and skills to address the needs of individuals, families, and communities, thereby making a tangible difference in promoting social justice and well-being.
19/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Ok now I understand
19/02/24, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great, So, Are you willing to pursue it?
19/02/24, 1:57 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Yes im willing but sorry i have last question..With that degree can i be able to work in the NON Governmental Organizations?
19/02/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Certainly! A Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Sociology degree can provide you with valuable skills and knowledge that are highly relevant to working in Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Many NGOs focus on addressing social issues such as poverty, inequality, human rights, and community development, which align closely with the subject matter covered in sociology programs. With a background in sociology, you can contribute to NGOs by conducting research, analyzing social trends, advocating for marginalized communities, designing and implementing programs, and working directly with individuals and communities in need. Your understanding of social structures, dynamics, and inequalities will be instrumental in creating positive social change through NGO work. Additionally, your ability to critically assess societal issues and propose solutions will make you a valuable asset to any NGO striving to make a meaningful impact on society.
19/02/24, 2:07 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Ok thank you very much for the information
19/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Definitely yes im willing to pursue it
19/02/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are most welcome!
19/02/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
19/02/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So,  If you have understood the course well, can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
19/02/24, 6:15 pm - +263 77 516 1076: Ms. Paliika how are you ?  Hope you are  fine .
19/02/24, 6:25 pm - +263 77 516 1076: Don't be surprised to see us off line   even contributing  to your discussion with Wycliffe, It is because we are into sole manufacturing industry ,,, clothe tailoring. So we are the workforce together with Mrs Mukasa _Wycliffes mother. Further more our little shop is at down stairs -  so network is another great challenge .

But we are so greatful   with the assistance you are giving our son Wycliffe.  I have great hope that  with you being there  ,, definately  Wycliffe will land there in India  to pursue his  programme.   

I thank you 🙏🙏🙏 <This message was edited>

I hope that your day is progressing well today.

Shall we start?
21/02/24, 11:03 am - +263 77 131 4650: Yes we can start
21/02/24, 11:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Wycliffe, Your passion for understanding human behavior and the social world is evident, and pursuing a BA degree in sociology at Edoof University seems like an excellent step towards achieving your career goals.

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

So, are you prepared to put in *200%* effort and seize any possibilities that come your way in order to alter your career?

21/02/24, 11:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career. I believe you will be researching about the course in detail.
 
*Now, as you know, Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform.*
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
21/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 131 4650: India is a large and diverse country with a long and rich history. The education system in India has its roots in the ancient Vedic period, and has evolved over time to include elements of British and Western systems of education. Today, India has a large and diverse education system, with both public and private schools, colleges, and universities. The country's education system is overseen by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, which sets the curriculum and standards for all schools and universities. There are also many specialized schools and colleges that focus on specific.
The Indian education system is unique in its emphasis on holistic development. The aim of education in India is not just to impart knowledge, but to help students develop their physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. The goal is to produce students who are not only knowledgeable, but also ethical, compassionate, and responsible citizens. The Indian education system emphasizes the development of critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. It also places a strong emphasis on moral and ethical values, and encourages students to
21/02/24, 11:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Wycliffe, Thank you for highlighting the rich history and diverse nature of India's education system. It's clear that the system has evolved over time, incorporating elements from various traditions while maintaining a focus on holistic development. The emphasis on nurturing not just knowledge, but also physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, along with a strong emphasis on critical thinking and ethical values, sets the Indian education system apart. This comprehensive approach aims to cultivate responsible and compassionate citizens equipped with essential skills for navigating a complex world.
21/02/24, 11:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also,  I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
21/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 131 4650: No im not
21/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 131 4650: Thank you very much
21/02/24, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/02/24, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 77 131 4650: Ok ok <This message was edited>
21/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 131 4650: My family will try to raise that cost for me
21/02/24, 12:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
21/02/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 131 4650: No I don’t know
21/02/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 516 1076: I want my Son to  study  at Edoofa ,,, no matter what . As a retired militant, I dont earn much on my pension. But I will try by all means to make it for Wycliffe
21/02/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 516 1076: With Ms Paliika nothing is impossible  ,,, I have that strong feeling you will help us.
21/02/24, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Mr. Israel!
21/02/24, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Thank you for sharing your determination to support your son, Wycliffe, in his educational journey at Edoofa. Your dedication and belief in his potential are truly inspiring. While financial constraints can be challenging, your unwavering commitment demonstrates your willingness to go the extra mile for Wycliffe's future. Rest assured, we will do our best to assist you and Wycliffe in navigating the process and exploring available options to make his dream of studying at Edoofa a reality.
21/02/24, 9:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 131 4650: Good morning Miss Pallika
22/02/24, 9:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
22/02/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 131 4650: Yes we can begin
22/02/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: That’s alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
22/02/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
22/02/24, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
22/02/24, 10:22 am - +263 77 131 4650: I believe that the Earn While Learn program is a great opportunity for students to gain valuable work experience while earning a degree. The program allows students to gain real-world experience in their field of study, while also earning an income. I think this is a fantastic way to prepare students for the workforce after graduation. It can also help them to develop important skills and networks that can be beneficial to their future careers.

And to answer the second question:

I believe that I would benefit greatly from the Earn While You Learn program.
22/02/24, 10:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 10:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: Absolutely,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. *This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families.
22/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 77 131 4650: Yes now i can see that the EWYL program is absolutely amazing
22/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 77 131 4650: Loading
22/02/24, 10:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed it is!!
22/02/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 131 4650: I'm glad you agree! I think the Earn While You Learn program is a great way to gain experience and make connections in the field.
22/02/24, 10:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great, Now, as we are proceeding towards the end, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
22/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Sorry im experiencing bad network connection this side
22/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 77 131 4650: I think the most significant fact is that Edoofa offers guaranteed scholarships to all its students. This is a big deal because it makes higher education more accessible and affordable for everyone. Tuition fees are often one of the biggest barriers to pursuing higher education, so this is a major selling point for Edoofa. It also shows that Edoofa is committed to helping its students succeed, no matter what their financial situation may be. This is something that sets Edoofa apart from other scholarship programs, and it's definitely worth highlighting.
22/02/24, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

22/02/24, 12:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work
22/02/24, 12:38 pm - +263 77 131 4650: This is so good, I believe that i will try my best and work very hard to earn more scholarship credits
22/02/24, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
22/02/24, 12:46 pm - +263 77 131 4650: My Father and Mom will help me with the remaining fee
22/02/24, 12:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That’s understandable,I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
22/02/24, 1:09 pm - +263 77 131 4650: "Thank you for asking about my family's thoughts on me studying abroad.My Family is so positive and happy for me to study abroad because they know it will bring a total change in our family and they know that i will have best life experience with the help of Edoofa , and they promised to support me 100%  until I finish my studies.
22/02/24, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear! It's truly heartening to know that your family is fully supportive of your decision to study abroad. Having their encouragement and backing will undoubtedly make your journey even more fulfilling. The promise of their unwavering support until you complete your studies is incredibly reassuring. With such a strong foundation of support, you're bound to excel in your academic pursuits and make the most out of the enriching experiences that studying abroad offers. Edoofa sounds like a fantastic resource, and combined with your family's support, there's no doubt you'll have an incredible life-changing experience.
22/02/24, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
22/02/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Thank you
22/02/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 131 4650: No I don’t know
22/02/24, 1:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, You see, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
22/02/24, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Yes
22/02/24, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Let me tell you *why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
22/02/24, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*

*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
22/02/24, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
22/02/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Ok ok now I understand
22/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Sorry i have a question..

So am I supposed to write another application form ?
22/02/24, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: No, Wycliffe, Our Admissions Team will be guiding you for the same!
22/02/24, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 1:53 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Ok ok thank you Miss Pallika
22/02/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 131 4650: So far we have discussed the first stage only
22/02/24, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are welcome, Wycliffe!
22/02/24, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's correct!
22/02/24, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Wycliffe,
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
22/02/24, 1:56 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Yes you can explain
22/02/24, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Please!
22/02/24, 1:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors. They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education and the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
22/02/24, 1:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
22/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Yes thank you im now clear with the process
22/02/24, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you have any queries?
22/02/24, 2:01 pm - +263 77 131 4650: No i don’t have
22/02/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Wycliffe, we have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
22/02/24, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Edoofa’s Website- www.edoofa.com* 
*Pictures (Edoofians from Africa studying in India): https://tinyurl.com/3ke35s35*

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.

22/02/24, 4:04 pm - +263 77 131 4650: Thank you very much Miss Pallika
22/02/24, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are most welcome!
22/02/24, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Have a great day ahead!
23/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 77 131 4650: Good morning Miss Pallika
23/02/24, 10:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Wycliffe, and Dear Parents!

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
23/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 77 131 4650: Yes im ready
23/02/24, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Wycliffe,
I hope you are doing well
23/02/24, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
23/02/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 131 4650: Yes we did
23/02/24, 10:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program?
23/02/24, 10:36 am - +263 77 131 4650: "My family was initially skeptical about the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but after learning more about it, they have become very supportive. They were worried about the costs and safety aspects of studying abroad, but I was able to show them that the program offers a lot of financial and emotional support. They also liked the fact that I would be able to earn an income while studying, which would help offset the costs. Overall, they were impressed by the level of organization and support that Edoofa offers, and they feel more at ease about me studying abroad."
23/02/24, 10:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
23/02/24, 10:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, Wycliffe, Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

23/02/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
23/02/24, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: You can share this video with your parents, please!
23/02/24, 10:41 am - +263 77 131 4650: Ok
23/02/24, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
23/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 131 4650: "My family had a lot of questions and concerns about the financial aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. They wanted to know if there were any hidden fees or costs associated with the program, and they were also worried about the cost of living in a foreign country. However, I was able to show them that the program is very transparent about its costs, and that there are many ways to offset the cost of living while studying abroad. They were also reassured by the fact that the program provides financial assistance to students who need it."
23/02/24, 10:46 am - +263 77 131 4650: This is really good
23/02/24, 10:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: I completely understand your concerns, McDonald. It's natural to have questions about the financial aspects of any program, especially when it involves studying abroad. I appreciate that you've taken the time to carefully consider all factors. It's worth noting that many students, like yourself, find tremendous value in our program despite initial worries about costs. In fact, there are numerous examples of students successfully self-financing their education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/02/24, 10:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I appreciate the willingness of your family to invest in your career
23/02/24, 10:52 am - +263 77 131 4650: Yes they want the best from me because im the only Boy in our family
23/02/24, 10:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to know that!
23/02/24, 10:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Wycliffe, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
23/02/24, 11:10 am - +263 77 131 4650: 1. The course that i would be studying through  Edoffa Program is (BA) in Sociology

2. ⁠i will be studying in India.

  3. Average cost is $6000-$8000 for studies in India without Scholarship

4. The annual fee that i will be paying if eligible for the program is $ 2000-$3000.

5. The enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program if im found eligible is $200 and is paid within 7 days and then the balance of $150 to be paid within a month

6.Here's my explanation of the Earn While Learning program, in my own words:

The Earn While Learning program is a unique opportunity that allows students to gain real-world experience while earning an income. It's a win-win situation for students, as they get to learn practical skills and make money at the same time. It's also a great way to gain confidence and build a professional network. Plus, the program offers a lot of flexibility, so students can tailor their experience to their own interests and goals. Overall, it's a fantastic way to gain valuable experience and prepare for the future.


7. Yes im clear
23/02/24, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: Excellent, Wycliife!
23/02/24, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: @263775161076 @263774409801 you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
23/02/24, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
23/02/24, 11:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*


Please address this using voice notes!
23/02/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 131 4650: I think they are facing network problems
23/02/24, 11:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand the network issues, Please let me know once available
23/02/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 131 4650: Ok fine
23/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 77 516 1076: Hie Ms Paliika

23/02/24, 11:59 am - +263 77 516 1076: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 12:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, Mr. Israel, I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
23/02/24, 12:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
23/02/24, 12:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
23/02/24, 12:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 12:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 1st or 2nd of March 2024 for $200 and the 1st or 2nd of April for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11st or 2nd of March 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
23/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 516 1076: <Media omitted>
