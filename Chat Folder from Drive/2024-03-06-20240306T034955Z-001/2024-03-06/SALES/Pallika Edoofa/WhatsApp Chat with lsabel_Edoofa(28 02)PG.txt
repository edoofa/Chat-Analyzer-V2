After interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship, I learn that the sky is the limit, despite being less priveleged, there is still hope for success... Edoofa is the world indeed. 

I should be accepted into Edoofa program because I am yearning for this opportunity.l wish to  set an example to the girl child in our community that despite being less privileged,  there is still a room to success.

How are you doing?
28/02/24, 12:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.


*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
