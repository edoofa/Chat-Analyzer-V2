22/02/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Susan, I'm truly sorry to hear about the loss of your family's cattle and the challenges your father is facing.

22/02/24, 1:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
