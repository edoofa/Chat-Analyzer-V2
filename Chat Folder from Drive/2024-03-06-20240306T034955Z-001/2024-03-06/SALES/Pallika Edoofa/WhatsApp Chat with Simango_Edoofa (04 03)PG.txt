05/03/24, 2:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session, I would like to know if you were interested in Medical Field, so why you haven't you opted Physics?
05/03/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 379 3241: What actually happened is that l was raised from a poor background.My father died when l was young .My mother struggled for my secondary  education. I learn my O and A Level  education in our rural areas at Ngundu High School. The school do not offer Pure Sciences at A Level so l was forced to do Mathematics, Biology  and Agriculture. I completed my A Level in 2017 .From there l spend  5 years trying to raise my fees inorder to repeat my A level .In 2023 l repeat my A Level at Chibi High School doing Mathematics, Biology and Chemistry being assisted by some of the members of the community. I choose Biology instead of Physics because my dream is to join the Medical field where there is more Biology
05/03/24, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Simango, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily. <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
