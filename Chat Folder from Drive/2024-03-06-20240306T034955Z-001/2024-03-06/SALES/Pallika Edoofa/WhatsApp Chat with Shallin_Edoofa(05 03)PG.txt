As scheduled, I am here to begin your sessions for the Edoofa Scholarship Program and evaluate your application.

Are you ready to begin?
05/03/24, 9:48 am - +263 77 476 3341: Yes Good morning
05/03/24, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Mr. Edward,
How are you doing today?
05/03/24, 10:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Edward, As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of students/parents or whoever is supporting the child’s education in the group. This ensures that you follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions that arise. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin. Please add Shallin, and her mother to the group. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
