05/03/24, 9:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Dube, As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of students/parents or whoever is supporting the child’s education in the group. This ensures that you follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions that arise. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.

*So, I am making you the group admin. Please add Mr. Maponya to the group. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
05/03/24, 9:55 am - +27 73 365 2895: He is already in the group..i think he is in school right now.

05/03/24, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Ms. Dube,  I will be guiding you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program. However, just before we delve into that, I would like to get to know you better as a parent.

Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.

05/03/24, 11:07 am - +27 73 365 2895: No.i have not been informed..id love to know more about Edoofa
05/03/24, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share some information then, *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!* <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 11:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe with some of the most elite schools. In Harare, we collaborate with *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Harare High, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John’s* and many others. To name a few from *Manicaland, St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class Academy, Chibuwe High, Nagle House* and so on with the children of the DEOs of Chipinge and Mutare having their children under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools such as *Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Dewure High, Chiredzi High* and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita- Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, *Midlands Province(Fletcher, Regina Mundi, etc). Mathebeland(North, South) we have St Mark’s, Usher High, Plumtree, Sizane High etc.* Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Dignitaries of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. *We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Mrs. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA)* who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2500+ Zimbabweans who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?*
05/03/24, 11:17 am - +27 73 365 2895: Ouk thank you.Do yo enrol students with O'Level or you only enrol those with A'Level?
05/03/24, 11:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, we enroll the students of O level and A level as well
05/03/24, 11:22 am - +27 73 365 2895: How many subjects to be precise
05/03/24, 11:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
05/03/24, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 01:45 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!
