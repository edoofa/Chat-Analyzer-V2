29/02/24, 10:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Samukeliso, in reviewing your application, I observed that obtaining a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery degree in India necessitates passing the MBBS exam. This examination is renowned for its rigor, often regarded as one of the most challenging exams in the country. To adequately prepare for it, students typically dedicate two years post-A levels to their studies. The level of competition is staggering, with only the top 5000 out of millions qualifying for the MBBS. This highlights the immense dedication and commitment required to succeed in such a competitive environment.
29/02/24, 10:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Furthermore, when considering the duration of the MBBS degree, it encompasses a total of five and a half years of academic study, followed by a year-long internship. Subsequently, pursuing specialization in a specific field requires an additional three years. Altogether, this amounts to a significant investment of 11 years of your life. During this period, your parents are required to make substantial investments in your higher education.
29/02/24, 10:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Furthermore, I'd like to offer some insight based on my recent experience with my team in Harare, Zimbabwe. During our time there, we noticed a scarcity of optical centers and a limited presence of individuals in the biotechnology sector. This observation underscores the significant demand and potential in these fields. Therefore, as your counselor, I highly recommend considering paths that align with the specific needs and demands of your hometown, rather than following the conventional route. By pursuing opportunities that address local needs, you can make a substantial impact while also fulfilling personal and professional aspirations.
29/02/24, 10:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, I do acknowledge your strong aspirations to work closely in the Medical field, treat people in need and make a difference, due to which you are eligible to pursue some of the best courses in the Medical field itself such as   

*1) Bachelor of Physiotherapy*

*2) Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*3) Bachelor of Pharmacy*

*4) Bachelor of Optometry*

*5) Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology etc*

However, I want to assure you that other courses can also pave the way for a successful career in the medical field. While MBBS requires significant investment of time and effort, and clearing the NEET Exam adds to the challenge, it's important not to feel disheartened. The courses I mentioned earlier are equally reputable and can lead to fulfilling careers as successful doctors. Your dedication and commitment, coupled with the right education and training, will undoubtedly lead you to achieve your aspirations in the medical profession

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
02/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 875 8769: Yes
02/03/24, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing?
02/03/24, 11:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Have you decided this?
02/03/24, 12:39 pm - +263 78 875 8769: Am fine well am considering continuing my education in Zimbabwe for MBBS
02/03/24, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Samukeliso,  I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
02/03/24, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see,  Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
02/03/24, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
02/03/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 875 8769: Yes
