04/03/24, 11:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
04/03/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 773 6807: Ok
04/03/24, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Okay so Tafadzwa, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/03/24, 11:43 am - +263 78 773 6807: I have what it take to meet these four significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship

04/03/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Ok thank you very much
04/03/24, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me explain this course to you!

04/03/24, 12:46 pm - +263 78 773 6807: For now i dont have anything
04/03/24, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
04/03/24, 12:50 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Yes he motivated me very much and in keen to do as well
04/03/24, 12:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright Tafadzwa, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
04/03/24, 1:00 pm - +263 78 773 6807: On that day they were not available due to certain circumstances. But i told them what we discussed
04/03/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 773 6807: My mother would be supporting me
04/03/24, 1:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

04/03/24, 1:14 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Ok
04/03/24, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/03/24, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
04/03/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Ok
04/03/24, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Considering your results of ESAT we also offer an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a Total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counselor I feel it's a great privilege that has been offered to you.
04/03/24, 1:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However Tafadzwa, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
04/03/24, 1:36 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Ok no problem
04/03/24, 1:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
04/03/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Im not familiar with it
04/03/24, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 1:42 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Ok understood
04/03/24, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright Tafadzwa, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in COUNTRY itself.
04/03/24, 1:47 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Ok understood
04/03/24, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/03/24, 1:53 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Yes
04/03/24, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/03/24, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
04/03/24, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
04/03/24, 1:54 pm - +263 78 773 6807: So in want to ask if im given 80% scholarship does it mean for a university that was supposed to be $4000 ,what amount would i be paying
04/03/24, 1:55 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Ok
04/03/24, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tafadzwa, Your annual fee after scholarship would be in the range of $2000-$3000 a year. the reason I shared the annual fees in a range is that Edoofa is associated with 250+ UGC-recognized universities and that is why we are able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their *Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well*, and  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well. 

Now it is obvious that every university would evaluate a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the Quantum of scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student gets to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.
04/03/24, 2:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Ok
04/03/24, 2:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So now would you like to ask anything?
04/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 773 6807: So i will have to pay this $2000-3000 amount before coming there or i will pay after im into the Earn While You Learning program
04/03/24, 2:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tafadzwa, Please note that once you are found eligible and get enrolled, your Admission and EWYL Program will be started right away, that will make you to earn before coming to India
04/03/24, 2:09 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Ok that is good
04/03/24, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Please!
04/03/24, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Is there anything else you would like to ask?
04/03/24, 2:14 pm - +263 78 773 6807: No thank you
04/03/24, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!
04/03/24, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check and an Interaction with the Board of Directors.
04/03/24, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/03/24, 2:15 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Ok thank you
04/03/24, 2:18 pm - +263 78 773 6807: Ok
05/03/24, 8:50 am - Pallika Edoofa changed the group name from "Tafadzwa shamboko_Edoofa(04/03)PG" to "Tafadzwa shamboko_ESAT(EA)"
