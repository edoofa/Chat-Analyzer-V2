1/3/24, 1:45 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Leyton have you gone through the video?

1/3/24, 1:50 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 1:51 PM - Tushti Edoofa: After watching let me know. If you face any issues just let me know!
1/3/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 382 2217: Yeah i have played the video
1/3/24, 2:02 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Good to hear from you Leyton!
1/3/24, 2:03 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Now, before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
1/3/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 382 2217: Well am Chibaya Leyton Tinodiwa.I'm a last born in a family of three.I am turning 19 in August.I love playing soccer and darts.I love to become an innovative AI technician.I love to work hard and trying to correct my mistakes because i dont give up
1/3/24, 2:10 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Nice to meet you Leyton! Turning 19 in August sounds exciting. I admire your passion for soccer and darts. Your goal of becoming an innovative AI technician is fantastic, and your dedication to hard work is commendable. Keep pushing forward.
1/3/24, 2:11 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
1/3/24, 2:17 PM - Tushti Edoofa: If you see the message, can you please reply.
1/3/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 382 2217: Mmmm not sure
1/3/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 382 2217: Ok noted....Sorry
1/3/24, 2:25 PM - Tushti Edoofa: It is okay!
1/3/24, 2:25 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
1/3/24, 2:25 PM - Tushti Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
1/3/24, 2:28 PM - +263 78 382 2217: Well understood
1/3/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 382 2217: So scholarship credits are paid direct university account.What's the highest figure a student can get as scholarship credit
1/3/24, 2:31 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Regarding this doubt you will eventually get to know through the sessions.
1/3/24, 2:31 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
1/3/24, 2:32 PM - +263 78 382 2217: Well thank you..
1/3/24, 2:33 PM - Tushti Edoofa: You are welcome!
1/3/24, 2:34 PM - +263 78 382 2217: It's great to know the H.O.D and the head coach as well really appreciate
1/3/24, 2:34 PM - Tushti Edoofa: They are really honoured to have such young mind like you!
1/3/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 382 2217: It's also interesting to chat with you guys you are really wonderful and humble
1/3/24, 2:37 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Great to hear from you Leyton.
1/3/24, 2:37 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
1/3/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 382 2217: Yeah it's interesting to know that
1/3/24, 2:40 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I'm glad you find it interesting!
1/3/24, 2:40 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

1/3/24, 3:14 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Good to hear from you! So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
1/3/24, 3:20 PM - +263 78 382 2217: The one with quotes excites me more
1/3/24, 3:21 PM - +263 78 382 2217: Sorry my network signal is a bit down on this side
1/3/24, 3:21 PM - Tushti Edoofa: That is amazing! Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
1/3/24, 3:22 PM - +263 78 382 2217: Yes its amazing cause Edoofians are also giving us their experiences its amazing too

Greetings to you @263782785793 @263785557843 ! Today, as you already know there won't be any sessions scheduled for Leyton. Instead, we'd like to take this opportunity to connect with you. 
I am sure that you must have had a chance to go through the conversations that I had with Leyton until now and that must have given you a certain clarity towards the program. I wanted to utilize this opportunity to understand from a parent’s perspective, what are your expectations from Leyton through the EWYL program and how you plan to keep a check on his progress regularly.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon! <This message was edited>

5/3/24, 2:48 PM - Tushti Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
5/3/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 382 2217: Well...Noted
5/3/24, 2:58 PM - Tushti Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
5/3/24, 2:58 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
5/3/24, 2:58 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*LEYTON/JULIA*
5/3/24, 2:59 PM - Tushti Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
5/3/24, 2:59 PM - Tushti Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
5/3/24, 2:59 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
5/3/24, 2:59 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

5/3/24, 3:00 PM - Tushti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 3:04 PM - +263 78 382 2217: Well on this projects will i be allowed to move into schools so as to get my numbers in track
5/3/24, 3:10 PM - Tushti Edoofa: Yes you can Leyton.
5/3/24, 3:11 PM - Tushti Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
5/3/24, 3:11 PM - Tushti Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
