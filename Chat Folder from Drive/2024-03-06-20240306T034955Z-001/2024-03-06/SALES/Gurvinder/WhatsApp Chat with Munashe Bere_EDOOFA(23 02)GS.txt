You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/02/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 831 7857: thank you so much sir
23/02/24, 10:12 am - +263 71 926 3978: thank you
23/02/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
23/02/24, 10:17 am - +263 71 926 3978: ok so Edoofa Scholarship is an organization which aims to help deserving students with
life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher
education as well as internship opportunities.
23/02/24, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
23/02/24, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/02/24, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/02/24, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/02/24, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 71 926 3978: yes that's very true
23/02/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Munashe, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/02/24, 10:34 am - +263 78 831 7857: so which universities do you connect with and are they internationally recognized
23/02/24, 10:35 am - +263 71 926 3978: yes Sir

Edoofa's Program will enable me to achieve my dreams since I will be able to pursue my dreams of proceeding with tertiary education which due to financial constraints which some has been caused by drought in my country and also failure to meet the actual required schools fees; my family and I have been failing to get enough money for me to proceed with my education (as well as my sister who is in university has also failed to access her results).I believe Edoofa's Program of Earning while Learning will help since I will be able to be employed and while I am pursuing with my career and be able to even assist my family and my society during hard times.
23/02/24, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Munashe I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
23/02/24, 2:36 pm - +263 71 926 3978: I am more than 200%
23/02/24, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/02/24, 2:48 pm - +263 71 926 3978: I want to study abroad since I will be able to gain new perspectives, get an opportunity to meet professionals in the course I want to study, be able to practice different languages, be able to expose and interact with people and colleagues from all across the globe.
23/02/24, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/02/24, 2:55 pm - +263 71 926 3978: alright so I am planning to share the knowledge and skills I would have got from studying abroad through seminars and workshops to different schools and institutes in my country
23/02/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Munashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
23/02/24, 3:02 pm - +263 71 926 3978: I agree but with my plans of sharing the knowledge and skills I would have got from studying abroad I do not mean that I would have completely set out to change the entire system but I will have to gain enough reputation in my country or society so that I will help share my ideas and knowledge
23/02/24, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
23/02/24, 3:04 pm - +263 71 926 3978: yes
23/02/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
23/02/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

23/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 926 3978: thank you
23/02/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
23/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 926 3978: I am not really aware please enlighten me more
23/02/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
23/02/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/02/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/02/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 926 3978: ok I see but for my first year I will I be able to pay it the remaining fee since I might need to go for the Earn while learning my family might fail to raise the money once since there is drought here in my country
23/02/24, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: So may I know, you don't think your parents can support you for this?
23/02/24, 3:30 pm - +263 71 926 3978: they might I am not 100% sure
23/02/24, 3:31 pm - Gurvinder: Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/02/24, 3:32 pm - +263 71 926 3978: yes
23/02/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Munashe, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/02/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 926 3978: ok thank you
23/02/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.

23/02/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/02/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 926 3978: Is it possible to do the EWYL program before coming to India
23/02/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please.
23/02/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/02/24, 3:37 pm - +263 71 926 3978: yes I believe it will
23/02/24, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Munashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/02/24, 3:38 pm - +263 71 926 3978: aw really
23/02/24, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/02/24, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/02/24, 3:44 pm - +263 71 926 3978: yes it is
23/02/24, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Munashe, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/02/24, 4:09 pm - +263 71 926 3978: ok I see
23/02/24, 8:11 pm - +263 71 926 3978: I will go for EWYL
28/02/24, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
28/02/24, 10:00 am - +263 78 831 7857: online
28/02/24, 10:00 am - +263 71 926 3978: online
28/02/24, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: Can you please elaborate?
28/02/24, 11:26 am - +263 71 926 3978: I go for earn while you learn since my family members might not be able to raise the required fees
28/02/24, 11:32 am - Gurvinder: So do you think after the EWYL program, your parents can support you for the rest of your fees.
28/02/24, 11:39 am - +263 71 926 3978: honestly they cannot because things are not well here in terms of finances <This message was edited>
28/02/24, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, so you do not want to continue?
28/02/24, 12:06 pm - +263 71 926 3978: This message was deleted
28/02/24, 12:46 pm - +263 71 926 3978: I want to continue
28/02/24, 12:54 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, then how will you manage to pay the rest of the fees, as the EWYL scholarship credits can only be used to pay the tuition fees?
28/02/24, 12:55 pm - +263 71 926 3978: I might stay off campus and also look for another job to pay for my residence and food
28/02/24, 8:34 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
28/02/24, 9:17 pm - +263 71 926 3978: thank you God bless you too
29/02/24, 9:10 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone,
Hope you are doing well,
Please come online so that we can continue with the session.
29/02/24, 9:21 am - +263 78 831 7857: online
29/02/24, 9:22 am - +263 71 926 3978: online
29/02/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: Are your parents online?
29/02/24, 10:25 am - +263 78 831 7857: online...
29/02/24, 10:26 am - +263 71 926 3978: yes they are
29/02/24, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 926 3978: sorry my network is down but we can talk
29/02/24, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: We will continue the conversation after your parents have gone through the FAQ document.
29/02/24, 10:59 am - +263 78 831 7857: noted
29/02/24, 11:01 am - +263 71 926 3978: ok thank you
29/02/24, 11:11 am - +263 71 926 3978: ok
29/02/24, 11:49 am - +263 71 926 3978: they have read
29/02/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: So knowing everything about the program, are you willing to move ahead?
29/02/24, 12:27 pm - +263 71 926 3978: yes I am
29/02/24, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
29/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 71 926 3978: yes
29/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Munashe as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?* <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 12:36 pm - +263 71 926 3978: about $2000 or more
29/02/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Munashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/02/24, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 12:44 pm - +263 71 926 3978: ok I see so do I have it pay it or I pay after get my admission
29/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: Please you only have to pay after you are found eligible for the program.
29/02/24, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/02/24, 12:57 pm - +263 71 926 3978: ok I see
29/02/24, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/02/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
29/02/24, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
29/02/24, 11:11 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 10 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
01/03/24, 8:15 am - +263 71 926 3978: hello I hope they are seeing it
02/03/24, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
02/03/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 831 7857: online
02/03/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
02/03/24, 12:34 pm - +263 71 926 3978: no I am not
02/03/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Munashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
02/03/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/03/24, 5:39 am - +263 71 926 3978: thank you
03/03/24, 8:22 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
03/03/24, 2:04 pm - +263 78 831 7857: online
03/03/24, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
03/03/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 831 7857: we have not paid the money needed
03/03/24, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Please, are you talking about the enrollment fees?
03/03/24, 5:33 pm - +263 71 926 3978: yes
03/03/24, 5:33 pm - +263 78 831 7857: yes
04/03/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
04/03/24, 10:36 am - +263 78 831 7857: online
04/03/24, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Please, you only need to pay after the child is found eligible for the program.
04/03/24, 10:40 am - +263 78 831 7857: ok so how do I find that he is eligible
04/03/24, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: Please that will be done after the counselling session.
04/03/24, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/03/24, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
04/03/24, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
04/03/24, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
04/03/24, 11:17 am - +263 78 831 7857: no go ahead we have understood
04/03/24, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
04/03/24, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

05/03/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: So @263788317857, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @263719263978 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
05/03/24, 10:09 am - +263 78 831 7857: but 7days is too much for me eish it was ok if they said after 30 days so that I would raise the money because things are not flowing well on my side as a parent
05/03/24, 10:19 am - +263 78 831 7857: ok so

He will be studying in India.
Average is around $ 6000- 8000 per year without scholarship 
I will be able to pay $300-$450
Enrollment fee is $350 they said it should be paid within 7days.
Earn While You Learn is   an Edoofa Initiative  which
students are assigned real-time live online projects during which they gain valuable
work experience while also earning scholarship credits. It gives credits basing on how the student works and these points are to help pay the fees for the student.
05/03/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Did you read this?

05/03/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please share your understandings?
05/03/24, 4:06 pm - +263 78 831 7857: so as I was reading I have seen that Edoofa engages parents since most of the finances are to be paid by them. I have discovered that the involvement of a parent is important as a parent is supposed to support his or her child in terms of education. I have read of Earn While You Learn which helps students to be innovative and get part time employment.
05/03/24, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Now moving on, you have to appear for the last evaluation criteria of the Edoofa Scholarship Program  which is the Interview round with the Edoofa Academic Board and Program Director, In which both the student and the parents have to participate.
