I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. <This message was edited>
23/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 919 3353: Okay thank you Mr Gurvinder
23/02/24, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Pemberayi, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Blessing, is that correct?
23/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 919 3353: Yaaa sure Mr Gurvinder 😂😂😂 Blessing told me everthing and he was my classmate when we were form 4s
23/02/24, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Blessing, also do tell me whether you learnt about Blessing’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
23/02/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 919 3353: He says Edoofa can offer a 50%to 100%  programe depending on you passing level.This schorlarship will also includes the accomodation for the student and Edoofa scholarships also helps student to get vacancy oppotunities abroad after finishing your degree
23/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
23/02/24, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/02/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/02/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/02/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 78 919 3353: Yaaa sure tertiary eduxation here in Zimbabwe is just something else, tertiary education in Zimbabwe is going down sooo l was thinking that its better to study abroad and my parents dont have problem with that because l will also have better job oppotunities
23/02/24, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Pemberayi, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/02/24, 1:11 pm - +263 78 919 3353: Okay sir l understant thats why l have been asking for permission to add my mom at the first place .....sooo can l add my mom

28/02/24, 3:51 pm - +263 78 919 3353: My name is Pemberayi Davison Guwa l am single which means l don't have siblings. My highest level of education so far is Advanced level . I finished my advanced level last year at Nkululeko high school located in Gweru District, Midlands Province. I was doing a subjects combination of Geography, Crop Science and Pure Mathematics under ZIMSEC board and I have 9 points as my final results. 

The course l would like to do is geology. I wanted to be a geologist since l was young because l wanted to to help my country to discover minerals which are not yet being discovered in areas like the Great Dyke which stretches  from Kariba Dam upto Beitbridge.l also wanted to be a geologist to help the world to discover more minerals which are in earth so that humans will not suffer the deficiency of resources such as electricity, gas and other sources of energy because l believe that there are some good resources which can be used to extract electricity , gas but they are not yet discovered by geologists. 

I have one parent which is my mother, my father died when l was 2 years old so my mother got married to another family and she have another 3 kids in that family.My mother is a teacher at a secondary school.

Evas Maganga my aunt from my father's side was the one who have been helping me with my education and she is also the one who will be supporting me with my education abroad . My aunt is a nurse in United Kingdom so she said its way better for me to study abroad because in Zimbabwe there is shortage of resources in Universities .
28/02/24, 8:30 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 10AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

29/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 78 919 3353: At the first place l like geography too much so l started looking for careers which can allow me to know earth much better than what l was doing in my ordinary and advanced studies soo l found geology and l also like discovering something new or new mining areas which are not yet discovered because l believe that earth is full of resources but its just that there are few people who want to explore and discover what's earth is made of....
29/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: Your motivation to study geology stems from a deep appreciation for geography and a desire to understand the Earth in greater depth. You're drawn to careers that allow you to explore and discover new facets of the planet beyond what you've learned in your ordinary and advanced studies.
29/02/24, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
