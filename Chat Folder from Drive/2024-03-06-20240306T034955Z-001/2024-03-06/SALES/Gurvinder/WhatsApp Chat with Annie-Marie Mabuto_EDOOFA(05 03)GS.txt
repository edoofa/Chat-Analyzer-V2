05/03/24, 12:38 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I'm online now sir
05/03/24, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
05/03/24, 12:44 pm - +263 71 266 0684: I was told by my child l knew nothing about it. 

Annie - Marie is the one who told me
05/03/24, 12:45 pm - +263 71 266 0684: It's okay Mr Gurvinder
05/03/24, 12:46 pm - +263 71 965 5738: The Edoofa scholarship programme is a scholarship programe initiated by Anhad Edutrain solutions that solves the affordability  problem for students in order to pursue higher education. It provides an earn while you learn programme for the to enable students to not only learn practical skills but also prepare for their future employability.
05/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
05/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/03/24, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/03/24, 12:49 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes sir that's it <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Annie, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 12:51 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes, I have everything it takes to get this scholarship
05/03/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now Annie, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

I am passionate about using the law to ensure fair and just outcomes for individuals accused of crimes, as well as to protect the rights of victims. I am drawn to the challenging and dynamic nature of criminal law, as it requires critical thinking, analytical skills, and the ability to navigate complex legal issues. I am committed to using my legal education to defend individuals accused of crimes, ensure that justice is served, and work towards improving the fairness and effectiveness of the criminal justice system.
05/03/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: That is a noble cause.
05/03/24, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Your lifelong dream and passion for making a positive impact on your community are truly inspiring. Your commitment to advocating for others, particularly those who may not have a voice, reflects a deep sense of justice and empathy.

05/03/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
05/03/24, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
05/03/24, 2:19 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes sir I am very confident in achieving it, I'm working very hard towards passing

05/03/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Annie I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
05/03/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I'm willing to give in 2000% if needed sir
05/03/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/03/24, 3:10 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Studying abroad offers a unique opportunity to experience a different culture, gain a global perspective, access high-quality education, enhance career prospects with international experience, and develop language skills and personal growth that may not be as readily available in my home country.
05/03/24, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
05/03/24, 3:16 pm - +263 71 965 5738: If given the opportunity to study abroad through this scholarship, I plan to bring back the knowledge, skills, and global perspectives gained from my international education to contribute towards enhancing the education system in my country. This would involve sharing best practices and advocating for educational reforms that align with global standards to elevate the quality of education in my country.
05/03/24, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Annie, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
05/03/24, 3:18 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I agree to that sir <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
05/03/24, 3:21 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes I wonder why
05/03/24, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

05/03/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: So now Annie, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
05/03/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I think I have understood enough sir, but can I ask, after completing the course is it mandatory to return to the home country
05/03/24, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Please you can work in India too.
05/03/24, 3:39 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Okay sir that's all
05/03/24, 3:45 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
05/03/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 965 5738: I've made my Research about foreign education but most of the applications require A-level results so I haven't found any that is suitable for now
05/03/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/03/24, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes I once checked and it was around 6 lakhs
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Which is maybe 6 000 US
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

05/03/24, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
05/03/24, 3:59 pm - +263 71 965 5738: Yes sir
05/03/24, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Annie, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

05/03/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/03/24, 4:38 pm - +263 71 965 5738: The Earn While You Learn program not only alleviates the financial burden on students but also serves as a valuable opportunity to gain practical work experience while pursuing their education. This allows students to earn income through part-time work, providing them with real-world exposure and skills that complement their academic studies making them a good choice for employment . By engaging in work alongside their studies, students can apply theoretical knowledge to their, practical skills, develop essential skills, and build a professional network all before they officially graduate making it easier for them to find jobs after that . I believe I will benefit because it will provide me with necessary skills and experience which will enable me to know how life will be after university and also raise my chances of being employed.
