*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
04/03/24, 10:47 am - +263 78 822 6122: Yes, it's Vincent Shongedza
04/03/24, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Vincent,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
04/03/24, 11:37 am - +263 78 822 6122: Ok Mr Gurvinder.
04/03/24, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Vincent, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Thandoluhle, is that correct?
04/03/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 822 6122: Yes
04/03/24, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Thandoluhle, also do tell me whether you learnt about Thandoluhle’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
04/03/24, 12:18 pm - +263 78 822 6122: Okay, I have not learned a lot so far, but I do know that the Edoofa scholarship program helps students in various ways, to include helping students who have poor financial backgrounds ,  providing proper career guidance and counseling, to students and  help students to identify their talents . Furthermore ,it helps students to pursue their dreams and desires by providing  all educational facilities.

As for Thandoluhle , I have no idea of  her experience .
04/03/24, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
04/03/24, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/03/24, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/03/24, 12:22 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/03/24, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/03/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 822 6122: It is very true, Mr Gurvinder.
04/03/24, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Vincent, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/03/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 355 4850: Hello. Good afternoon
04/03/24, 1:03 pm - +263 78 822 6122: Yes I do
04/03/24, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: Now Vincent, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

04/03/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 822 6122: Okay, my name is Vincent Shongedza , I'm a lower 6 student at Budiriro 1 High School which is located in Harare, and I did my ordinary level course at the same school as well.

I took 9 subjects at my ordinary level course , and got the following grades
. Combined science (A),
. Biology (B),
. Mathematics (B),
. Physics (B),
. Geography( B ),
. English language (B),
. History( B ),
. Chemistry( C ),
.Shona language (C).

I'm doing Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry as my Advanced Level combination.
My burning desire is to study medical sciences.


My father is a mixture operator at a company called Turnall Holdings Limited and he does not earn a lot of money.
He only did ordinary level and got his  job  .


My mother is jobless, she is the one who looks after the family at home.
She did not managed to finish her education  due to financial reasons.
She did her education level up to form three.


We are a family of 5 children, and I and my twin sister are the second  born , the first born is my sister aged 22, and finally  my young twin brothers aged 9 years.
My sister did advanced level at Mhari High School in Chivhu and ended there  due to financial burden,she is doing nothing for now.


Currently, the school fees for advanced level students at our school is $137 US dollars per term.
It is yet to develop, hence there are no enough educational facilities like laboratories, 
I applied at this school because my father could not afford the school fees at better schools.
04/03/24, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to know you Vincent.
04/03/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study medical sciences, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
04/03/24, 8:05 pm - +263 78 822 6122: The major reason I'm interested in pursuing this dream of mine is that, I want to save people's lives.
Because in our country where it seems to be a  shortage of doctors, people are dying, not because the diseases are difficult to cure or to  treat,but it's because they are failing to have immediate medical care.
Moreso , I will be able to assist any one who needs immediate help.

Another reason is that, studying medicine has been my burning desire,hence I wanted to be proud of myself one day .
04/03/24, 8:05 pm - +263 78 822 6122: I'm really sorry for not responding on time, because I have been at school all this while.
05/03/24, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
05/03/24, 9:08 am - +263 78 822 6122: Ok Mr Gurvinder
05/03/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Your desire to save lives and address the shortage of doctors in your country is truly admirable. Your recognition of the critical need for immediate medical care highlights your compassion and sense of responsibility towards your community.
05/03/24, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
05/03/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 822 6122: None of my family members had pursued  this career.
05/03/24, 9:59 am - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
05/03/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 822 6122: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 822 6122: This is my ordinary level result slip

05/03/24, 10:08 am - +263 78 822 6122: As for form 5 we have not write the tests for the end of term
05/03/24, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: Please share the term results then.
05/03/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 822 6122: I'm sorry, we have not yet write any tests, just exercises.
05/03/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Noted, so you want to get admission in 2026?
