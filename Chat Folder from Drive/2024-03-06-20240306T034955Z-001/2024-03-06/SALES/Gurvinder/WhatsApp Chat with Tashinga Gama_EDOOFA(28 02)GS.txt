29/02/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 140 2173: Thank you Mr Gurvinder
29/02/24, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Tashinga, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Edith, is that correct?
29/02/24, 10:15 am - +263 78 140 2173: Yes sir
29/02/24, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Edith, also do tell me whether you learnt about Edith’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/02/24, 10:26 am - +263 78 140 2173: Ok sir from Edith I learned that Edoofa is a program that is there to provide quality yet affordable education .Also,I learnt that Edoofa is there to help smoothen the journey to education as it provides you with a scholarship which is based on your hard work as well as acquiring a good result on a given examination and exhibit your passion for the desired program .I got enlightened that basing with your academic achievement, Edoofa scholarship and the Earn While You Learn program your departure to India will be as smooth since you will be able to cater for your needs through what Edoofa program offers
29/02/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
29/02/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/02/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/02/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/02/24, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 140 2173: She also told me that her journey has been going well and that she is set to go and exude her zeal towards her program through Edoofa program.And from her I can conclude that hard work is what it needs
29/02/24, 10:34 am - +263 78 140 2173: Yes sir that's it
29/02/24, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Tashinga, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/02/24, 10:42 am - +263 78 140 2173: Yes sir
29/02/24, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: Now Tashinga, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:
*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective.

Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.
*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/03/24, 3:57 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Ok thank you for that sir ,well if I be given such an opportunity I will surely uplift my grass root ,my hard work and dedication towards learning will necessitate my implementation of what I had gained out of the country and even seeking higher to better the standards of education system making an inclusion of my hungry ,motivated fellow citizens for the betterment of the education system of our country
04/03/24, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tashinga, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
04/03/24, 4:01 pm - +263 78 140 2173: I would agree with you if it was possible because seeking for this scholarship is a total answer that at the moment the environment is not conducive
04/03/24, 4:03 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
04/03/24, 4:04 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Yes sir ,that is a question I would probably like answered
04/03/24, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

04/03/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: So now Tashinga, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
04/03/24, 4:25 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Yes I have understood now sir thank you very much
04/03/24, 4:26 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Now I would like to know what is expected of me next
04/03/24, 4:26 pm - +263 78 140 2173: This message was deleted
04/03/24, 4:28 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Sorry sir
05/03/24, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, everyone!

I hope this message finds you well.

I request everyone to come online so that we can continue with our session.
05/03/24, 9:34 am - +263 78 140 2173: Good morning sirs
05/03/24, 9:40 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
05/03/24, 9:41 am - +263 78 140 2173: No I haven't
05/03/24, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
05/03/24, 9:43 am - +263 78 140 2173: I don't think so
05/03/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
05/03/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/03/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/03/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 78 140 2173: Ok Mr Gurvinder thank you for helping me and I have understood all you have shared with me here
05/03/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
05/03/24, 9:57 am - +263 78 140 2173: Yes sir you may
05/03/24, 9:58 am - +263 78 140 2173: I love to learn from you sir
05/03/24, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: Tashinga, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
05/03/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 140 2173: Wow this is actually great I didn't know much about it until today sir thank you
05/03/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

05/03/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/03/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

05/03/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
05/03/24, 10:15 am - +263 78 140 2173: Yes I think this will benefit me much as I will be connected to the most powerful insight and I will be proactive
05/03/24, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Tashinga, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/03/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 140 2173: Ok sir thank you very much I can see how it goes
05/03/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 140 2173: Hard work is what is needed
05/03/24, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/03/24, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Tashinga, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
05/03/24, 1:34 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Yes sir you are right
05/03/24, 1:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
05/03/24, 1:52 pm - +263 78 140 2173: I had not yet we were waiting till evening
05/03/24, 1:52 pm - +263 78 140 2173: And to hear from you as well on what percentage of scholarship did I get
05/03/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/03/24, 2:02 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Yes sir I am
05/03/24, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: Tashinga as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/03/24, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
05/03/24, 2:20 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Yes sir it's network problem only
05/03/24, 2:22 pm - +263 78 140 2173: $1500-$2250
05/03/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Tashinga, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/03/24, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Ok sir I get you on this
05/03/24, 2:27 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Wow this is great sir ,you are really making education affordable
05/03/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/03/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Yes I do agree with you dir
05/03/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 140 2173: I agree with you sir
05/03/24, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/03/24, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
05/03/24, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
05/03/24, 2:44 pm - +263 78 140 2173: This sounds interesting sir
05/03/24, 2:45 pm - +263 78 140 2173: This is great sir I get that sir
05/03/24, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
05/03/24, 2:49 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Not yet familiar with it sir you may shed light on that
05/03/24, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Tashinga, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in COUNTRY itself.
05/03/24, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/03/24, 2:51 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Ok sir
05/03/24, 2:53 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Yes sir I have understood you well
05/03/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/03/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
05/03/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
05/03/24, 2:54 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
05/03/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Ok sir I am with you
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 140 2173: So if everything is sorted out when will I be in school
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Please, in August.
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 78 140 2173: Ok sir thank you very much
05/03/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
05/03/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/03/24, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
