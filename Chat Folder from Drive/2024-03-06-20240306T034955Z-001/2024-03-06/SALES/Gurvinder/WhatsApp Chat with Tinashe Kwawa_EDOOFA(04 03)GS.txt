04/03/24, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Tinashe, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Kundai, is that correct?
04/03/24, 3:05 pm - +263 71 674 5048: No l actually got to know about it via Facebook then l started researching till l had a chat with Ananya mam
04/03/24, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Ms Ananya?
04/03/24, 3:07 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Am I allowed to make an audio
04/03/24, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Please respond via text.
04/03/24, 3:09 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Ok l will
04/03/24, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, please.
04/03/24, 3:18 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Basically Ananya mam taught me all l know  about Edoofa inclusive of it helps vulnerable students who are unable to pay fully for their school fees . Secondly Edoofa assists students interms of helping them boost their confidence through high quality professional mentorship . Thirdly  it helps students attain their education in a clean affordable way . I also got to learn about the term earn while you learn . Last but not least I also got to learn that  enrolled students get to meet some of the multinational recognized CEOz across the globe . 


Seriously l am much impressed and intrigued about this program .

I hope l will be part of the Edoofian family .Thank you
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/03/24, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/03/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Yes yes l am looking forward in granted this opportunity
04/03/24, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tinashe, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/03/24, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
04/03/24, 3:35 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Yes I do
04/03/24, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tinashe, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

04/03/24, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: So as I can see that you filled the application form for the counselling session but in that you wrote that you want to do engineering but right now you are telling that you want to study business, so can you please share what changed your mind?
04/03/24, 4:04 pm - +263 71 674 5048: What changed my mind is that when I wrote the test l wrote under department of commerce because I discovered that  a person who did commercials should write what he did in high school .

04/03/24, 4:09 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Ok basically what motivates me is this feeling that l feel most of the times . The feeling to make change world wide . As you can see most Africans especially my fellow Zimbabweans are un employed . So when I think about unemployment as well as starvation  lingering around it gives me the strength because I hate to see widows , orphans , elderly people sleep on empty stomach seriously it hurts n pains me
04/03/24, 4:10 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Am sorry for saying more than required . I apologize

04/03/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
04/03/24, 4:18 pm - +263 71 674 5048: No no one has ever even  thought of that . They support the idea of food to mouth only
04/03/24, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level results for evaluation?

05/03/24, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Tinashe I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
05/03/24, 10:23 am - +263 71 674 5048: Sir as far as my education is concerned l will even give 300%  hardwork as well as concerntration .

05/03/24, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/03/24, 10:36 am - +263 71 674 5048: The main reason l don't want to study in my country is because 1st my parents can't afford for my tertiary tuition in the first place 2ndly the education abroad is advanced as well as technical 3rdly l can get to meet some CEOz outside  this country . Right now l am unable to meet any CEOz or business tycoons bcz of my poor financial status 4thly Mentorship here in Zimbabwe   is technically not for free to everyone especially to those with poor financial status 5thly When l study abroad l can to learn new cultures the way they live  and meet new people . 

Thank you
05/03/24, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
05/03/24, 10:49 am - +263 71 674 5048: Ok basically if  given the opportunity  l am going to introduce what l have already learnt from you the idea of earn while you learn. And also the introduction of assisting students  with practical and technical programs  especially opharns and the vulnerable ones like the disabled etc  . Free practical education to the disabled especially
05/03/24, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tinashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
05/03/24, 1:07 pm - +263 71 674 5048: I do agree
05/03/24, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
05/03/24, 1:09 pm - +263 71 674 5048: True  true  l heard so
05/03/24, 1:09 pm - +263 71 674 5048: So can you please post my results

05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: I explained you here.

05/03/24, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 1:53 pm - +263 71 674 5048: So what is the way forward after showing me these results .
05/03/24, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
05/03/24, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
05/03/24, 4:28 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Hello l am
05/03/24, 4:28 pm - +263 71 674 5048: Yes l am highly motivated
05/03/24, 4:30 pm - +263 71 674 5048: What if l start by studying for the first 3 years or so then l pay my fees once I start working
