02/03/24, 9:42 am - Shubham Madhwal: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University

02/03/24, 9:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so Tawananyadra, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

To get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

1. *Qualification to the ESAT Exam* (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
2. *A Level and Previous Results* 
3. *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who can complete their counselling stage within a day has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
4. *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counselling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
02/03/24, 9:57 am - +263 77 769 1023: Yes I do
02/03/24, 10:00 am - +263 77 769 1023: I do have what it takes to meet the significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship
