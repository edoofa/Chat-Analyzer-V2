Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
29/02/24, 11:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
29/02/24, 11:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

04/03/24, 8:55 am - +263 78 110 5743: Okey.... let me say something about my previous school then . Previously before Chinhoyi 2 High , l was at Parkinson Secondary where l did my O Level which was one of the best schools in Shurugwi (midlands) Parkinson was headed by Mr Gombingo. The teachers there were very good and they used to monitor me closely so that l would remain on the right lane which contributed to my betterness  and also there was a guidance and counselling group where we were taught good morals and values which l used to panel beat  my life and became a well mannered and respectful person l am  today . At Parkinson when l was a form two kid l was made a prefect then eventually became the headgirl of my school because l was believed to be motivating and a good example who had good influences on others  when l was in form four. Besides the leadership part , l was also a good chess player from form one and the highest level l reached in terms of chess competitions was the national level .
04/03/24, 9:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: So you shared that your aunt assist's you for your higher education, Have you told her that you have applied for the Edoofa Program?

05/03/24, 10:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/03/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 110 5743: Morning morning
05/03/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 110 5743: I am in
05/03/24, 10:36 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
05/03/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 110 5743: Okey  , let's say l have acquired the scholarship what are the requirements
05/03/24, 11:28 am - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
05/03/24, 11:30 am - +263 78 110 5743: Yes sure
05/03/24, 11:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to geologist so geology, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field? <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 11:45 am - +263 78 110 5743: Okey sure
