Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

01/03/24, 9:31 am - +263 78 191 4527: Advance Mufari is the only son who was born in a wedlock in a family of five . My Aunt is striving to pay for school fees and she is the one who paid for my school fees since childhood. Since my parents couldn't be able to pay but my parents and my aunt will be supportive for my higher education abroad.

I have completed my Advanced level last year and I have got 18 points. My first choice for undergraduate degree is Actuarial science , as I have always been fascinated by Mathematics and aspire to go deeper with it .

My parents and my aunt are striving to give me a decent life just like any other normal kid since my parents are on health problems and they do not have employment. Although I had shortfalls now and then,  I managed to complete my Advanced level and I was very focused on my studies without the burden of a thought in the back of my mind about my fees and school basics.

However, it is now I need help more than ever , because my younger sisters are now in need of the same prioritisation I was given when I was their age. They're now starting form one and my elder sisters have managed to complete their Ordinary level and they're now married.

I completed my Advanced level while I was at Nyaningwe Secondary School. My school is located in Masvingo Province and my school fees per term was one hundred and forty six 

I'm looking forward to a positive response
01/03/24, 9:50 am - Shubham Madhwal: So Advance, I can see that your parents are striving to provide for your education, incase you do not manage to attain this scholarship, then what plans would you make to pursue your education?
01/03/24, 9:56 am - +263 78 191 4527: I will do some projects which can help me pursue  my education
01/03/24, 10:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: Can you further elaborate on what sort of Proejcts you are referring to?
01/03/24, 10:11 am - +263 78 191 4527: Chicken... broilers or layers. It's just the fact that I didn't plan this but I will have many ideas as soon as I'm in it
01/03/24, 10:14 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted, Advance, did you do any prior research regarding cost of Education abroad or locally?
01/03/24, 10:17 am - +263 78 191 4527: I didn't do any research for now
01/03/24, 10:26 am - Shubham Madhwal: Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

01/03/24, 10:27 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

*Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT)* https://www.cut.ac.zw/welcome/assets/files/fees-structure/School%20of%20Engineering%20Science.pdf - *($535 per term)*

*University of Zimbabwe (UZ)* -https://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/faculties/160-fac-of-medicine/med-deparrtments/305-med-dpt-of-comm *($523 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
01/03/24, 10:28 am - +263 78 191 4527: Okay
01/03/24, 10:28 am - Shubham Madhwal: So after looking at the facts shared above what do you think is more advantageous, to study at a globally recognized university abroad with an abundance of exposure and opportunities along with a similar fee structure as compared to studying at a local university where you will have no guarantee if you would get a job or not?
01/03/24, 10:35 am - +263 78 191 4527: Studying abroad is an ad advantage since I will have a guarantee of having a proper job
01/03/24, 10:35 am - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that
01/03/24, 10:36 am - Shubham Madhwal: I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to Actuarial science, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?

01/03/24, 11:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please,
01/03/24, 11:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: Advance, I hope you are aware that Actuarial science is a professional certification and not a Bachelor's course?
01/03/24, 11:36 am - +263 78 191 4527: Okay but what's the difference
01/03/24, 11:38 am - +263 78 191 4527: I'm deeply drawn to the field of actuarial science not only because of its emphasis on mathematics, statistics, and finance but also because of the diverse opportunities it offers. Actuaries play a crucial role in various industries such as insurance, pensions, healthcare, and even in government organizations, where their expertise in assessing and managing risk is highly valued.

Moreover, the field is constantly evolving with advancements in technology and data analytics, providing opportunities for continuous learning and growth. Aspiring to become an actuary, I'm eager to utilize my analytical skills to solve complex problems, develop innovative solutions, and ultimately contribute to making sound financial decisions that have a positive impact on businesses and society.

Ultimately, my goal is to not only excel in my career as an actuary but also to become a trusted advisor, leveraging data-driven insights to guide organizations towards sustainable growth and success.
01/03/24, 11:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please what I meant was Students interested in becoming actuaries typically start by obtaining a degree in a related field and then pursue professional certifications to further advance their careers
01/03/24, 12:21 pm - +263 78 191 4527: Okay
01/03/24, 1:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e the picture of results for A-Level and O-Level results.
01/03/24, 1:13 pm - +263 78 191 4527: Okay
01/03/24, 6:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

04/03/24, 9:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?
04/03/24, 9:44 am - +263 78 191 4527: Yes why only India
04/03/24, 9:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

1. *Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.
04/03/24, 9:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Renowned Institutions:* India is home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education. Students can choose from a wide range of disciplines, including politics, philosophy, engineering, medical sciences, biology, business, and media/journalism.

04/03/24, 9:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: 5. *Global Recognition and Career Prospects:* Indian degrees are globally recognized, opening doors to a wide range of career opportunities worldwide. Graduates from Indian institutions have achieved success in various fields globally.

05/03/24, 10:00 am - +263 78 191 4527: Ready
05/03/24, 10:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/03/24, 10:02 am - +263 78 191 4527: I'm doing well Sir
05/03/24, 10:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
05/03/24, 10:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
05/03/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 191 4527: I don't have questions
05/03/24, 10:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
05/03/24, 10:18 am - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
05/03/24, 11:02 am - +263 78 191 4527: Studying abroad is an advantage to me and my family , since after perusing my degree I will have a guarantee of getting a job . Universities in India are globally recognised and with an abundance exposure and opportunities
05/03/24, 11:03 am - +263 78 191 4527: For now no research have been done  and I didn't apply to any university abroad
05/03/24, 11:05 am - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
05/03/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 191 4527: You can explain further for the cost of Education there in India
05/03/24, 11:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
05/03/24, 11:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
05/03/24, 11:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
05/03/24, 11:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 11:25 am - +263 71 298 0161: Around $60 0000
05/03/24, 11:27 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please I did not understand
05/03/24, 11:27 am - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate @263712980161 ?
05/03/24, 11:29 am - +263 71 298 0161: I think $60 000 for 4 years I am not sure
05/03/24, 11:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
05/03/24, 11:32 am - +263 71 298 0161: Okay  thanks for the message l am now in the picture of the costs of education in India
05/03/24, 11:34 am - +263 71 298 0161: Okay noted Sir
05/03/24, 11:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
05/03/24, 11:53 am - +263 71 298 0161: No question at the moment
05/03/24, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/03/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 191 4527: Yes how it works...and how it can be efficient and productive
05/03/24, 12:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/03/24, 12:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
05/03/24, 12:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
05/03/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 298 0161: Okay noted with thanks
05/03/24, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

05/03/24, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/03/24, 1:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

05/03/24, 2:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
05/03/24, 2:37 pm - +263 71 298 0161: Okay that's great
05/03/24, 3:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Until a few years ago, the cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for the majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, and emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.* <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 3:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year. Isn't it?*

05/03/24, 4:34 pm - +263 78 191 4527: Yeah I'm getting to understand it
