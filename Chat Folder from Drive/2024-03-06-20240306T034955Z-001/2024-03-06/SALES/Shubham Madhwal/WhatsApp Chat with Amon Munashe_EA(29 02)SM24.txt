Are you ready?
05/03/24, 11:23 am - +263 77 335 9614: I'm a busy man you talked to my son  he knows my financial status so when you said it's fully funded we think that we are not going to pay anything
05/03/24, 11:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate please, I did not understand
05/03/24, 12:30 pm - +263 77 335 9614: Right in our minds we thought if it is a fully funded  we are not going to pay nothing
05/03/24, 12:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: And what do you mean by a fully funded scholarship?
05/03/24, 12:35 pm - +263 77 335 9614: I thought you would cater for everything
05/03/24, 1:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please are you aware of the differences between a scholarship and a sponsorship?
05/03/24, 1:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 1:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

1. Scholarships
2. Sponsorships
05/03/24, 1:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Scholarships make education affordable for students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwe Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.
05/03/24, 1:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time
05/03/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 335 9614: Ok I get it
05/03/24, 2:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So what are your plans ahead?
05/03/24, 3:46 pm - +263 77 335 9614: I will go back to my son if he still wants i will come back to you
05/03/24, 3:47 pm - +263 77 335 9614: Coz he already applied to the university of Zimbabwe 🇿🇼
05/03/24, 4:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please
