08/02/24, 7:03 pm - Gurvinder: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow morning at 10 AM CAT, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application.
08/02/24, 7:04 pm - +263 71 132 0162: Okay Thank you Mr Gurvinder
09/02/24, 8:47 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do." - Pelé*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
09/02/24, 9:06 am - +263 71 132 0162: Good morning Sir
09/02/24, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Tafadzwa,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Piiyush, Head of Counselling and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/02/24, 9:32 am - +263 71 132 0162: Its a pleasure to me too Mr Gurvinder
09/02/24, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/02/24, 9:46 am - +263 71 132 0162: My understanding of the Edoofa Program is that the program offers scholarships to students throughout the nations offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and it makes education affordable and accessible  to students and also employability is driven so that  the students become future leaders as well as planning and giving them opportunities through which they can  help themselves
09/02/24, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, so my understanding is that you previously had a session with Mr Shubham, right?
09/02/24, 9:49 am - +263 71 132 0162: Yes l did a session with Mr Shubham
09/02/24, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the program again?
09/02/24, 10:02 am - +263 71 132 0162: Yes you may
09/02/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/02/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/02/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/02/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/02/24, 10:27 am - +263 71 132 0162: That is true
09/02/24, 11:27 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Tafadzwa, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
09/02/24, 11:29 am - +263 71 132 0162: I certainly will meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship
09/02/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: Now Tafadzwa, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

The curriculum typically covers topics such as human behavior, social policy, research methods, and interventions for individuals and groups facing challenges such as poverty, discrimination, mental illness, and substance abuse. Students also learn about ethics, cultural competence, advocacy, and social justice in order to effectively support clients and promote positive change in society.

Social workers work with people facing a variety of challenges, such as poverty, mental health issues, substance abuse, domestic violence, and more. They provide support, advocacy, and resources to help clients navigate difficult situations and access the services they need. Social workers also work to address systemic issues and promote social justice through policy advocacy and community organizing.

Additionally, I aim to continue learning and growing in my field to become a knowledgeable and respected professional in sociology.
Overally l envision using my expertise in sociology to make meaningful contributions to the community and societal landscape
10/02/24, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Tafadzwa I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
10/02/24, 9:56 am - +263 71 132 0162: Yes Sir l am certainly willing to give my 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come my way in order to transform my career
10/02/24, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
10/02/24, 10:11 am - +263 71 132 0162: Firstly I want to study abroad because I believe I will have access to a top-tier program and research opportunities.Studying abroad can also provide me with access to high-quality educational resources. I can also get exposure to diverse perspectives and experiences due to different cultural backgrounds.All this can lead to the advancement of my career through different opportunities abroad.Lastly studying abroad can enhance my personal growth,living in a new environment and being able to adapt and learn and experience new cultures
10/02/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
10/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 71 132 0162: Okay if l would be given this opportunity to pursue my higher education through the scholarship l would focus on preparing under privileged students to work in various settings such as schools, hospitals, mental health clinics and community organizations to help individuals in my country improve their well being as well as promote postive change in the society.
10/02/24, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tafadzwa, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
10/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 71 132 0162: Yes l agree Sir
10/02/24, 10:48 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
10/02/24, 10:48 am - +263 71 132 0162: Yes true
10/02/24, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
10/02/24, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* Top-rated Indian universities cover a wide array of fields from engineering to journalism.

3. *Quality Education and Research:* India emphasizes practical skills and hands-on research, pushing your learning boundaries.

10/02/24, 11:13 am - +263 71 132 0162: Okay l understand
10/02/24, 11:29 am - Gurvinder: So now Tafadzwa, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
10/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 71 132 0162: I understood
I would like to ask that if you get a scholarship is there also accommodation?
10/02/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
10/02/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
10/02/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
10/02/24, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 11:53 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
10/02/24, 11:57 am - +263 71 132 0162: Okay thank you
10/02/24, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
10/02/24, 1:10 pm - +263 71 132 0162: Yes Sir
12/02/24, 10:07 am - +263 71 132 0162: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
12/02/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 509 0656: This message was deleted
12/02/24, 10:55 am - Gurvinder: Good morning! let's draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom found in the Bible:

 *Proverbs 3:6*
*"Seek His guidance in all you do, and He will show you the path to take. Embrace education with a heart full of reverence."*

Let's start the session and embrace the transformative power of education
12/02/24, 10:55 am - +263 71 132 0162: Okay Sir

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

05/03/24, 11:46 am - Shubham Madhwal: Moreover, the ethical and advocacy components that are integral to Social Work are also highly valued in the legal field.
