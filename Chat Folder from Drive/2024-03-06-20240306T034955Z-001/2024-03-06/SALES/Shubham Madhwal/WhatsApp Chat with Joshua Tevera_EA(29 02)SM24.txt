29/02/24, 11:00 am - +263 77 212 0099: For now he is unreachable  but I will confirm about the scholarship.
29/02/24, 11:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted, So let me further elaborate to you about the program!
29/02/24, 11:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
29/02/24, 11:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
29/02/24, 11:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
29/02/24, 11:02 am - +263 77 212 0099: Surely good idea Sir

01/03/24, 9:50 am - +263 77 705 6234: Well udying Abroad like India has vast knowledge and experts at the same have more resourced and techniques which are advanced than those in my country of origin .that is a better chance at reaching my goal
01/03/24, 9:51 am - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
01/03/24, 9:56 am - +263 77 705 6234: I haven't applied to any university abroad.....but i am still doing my research
01/03/24, 9:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright, As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
01/03/24, 10:11 am - +263 77 705 6234: i don't have any knowledge of that i was hoping you can help me there
01/03/24, 10:14 am - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
01/03/24, 10:14 am - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
01/03/24, 10:14 am - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
01/03/24, 10:14 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
01/03/24, 10:31 am - +263 77 705 6234: Okay noe i knoe so through endoofa it will be reduced to 3000 per year okay that's  a good thing thing..and a lot of aid given
01/03/24, 10:32 am - +263 77 705 6234: What is the earn while you learn program
01/03/24, 10:33 am - +263 77 705 6234: Okay now i know thank you
01/03/24, 10:35 am - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.
01/03/24, 10:35 am - Shubham Madhwal: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
01/03/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Okay now i understand how it works
01/03/24, 12:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that Joshua

01/03/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Yes of course
01/03/24, 12:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/03/24, 12:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
01/03/24, 12:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
01/03/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Okay i understand now
01/03/24, 1:07 pm - +263 77 705 6234: So its like working while learning?
01/03/24, 1:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In a way yes please!
01/03/24, 1:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

01/03/24, 1:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
01/03/24, 1:24 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Yes i can see ..i have been for this
01/03/24, 1:25 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Woow okay
01/03/24, 1:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
01/03/24, 1:37 pm - +263 77 705 6234: They cycle of the stages you go through inorder to be under the endoofa program and the requirements like visa
01/03/24, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
01/03/24, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
01/03/24, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
01/03/24, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
01/03/24, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
01/03/24, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
01/03/24, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
01/03/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 705 6234: okay now i know how it works..
01/03/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Okay i understoond
01/03/24, 1:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
01/03/24, 1:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
01/03/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Okay that is good indeed
01/03/24, 1:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.
01/03/24, 1:45 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Okay
01/03/24, 1:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
01/03/24, 1:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
01/03/24, 1:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
01/03/24, 1:50 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Okay umm i understand more now thank you for the enlightment
01/03/24, 1:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
01/03/24, 2:06 pm - +263 77 705 6234: the learn while you earn.......its prepares you for the real world.and helps reduce burden of cost of my education
01/03/24, 2:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
01/03/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 705 6234: My parents
01/03/24, 2:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
01/03/24, 2:56 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Yes i read that
01/03/24, 3:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
01/03/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Okay that's good
01/03/24, 3:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
01/03/24, 3:06 pm - +263 77 705 6234: okay that's good indeed
01/03/24, 3:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
01/03/24, 3:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
01/03/24, 3:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
01/03/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Okay i fully understand now
01/03/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 705 6234: That was helpful
01/03/24, 5:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.

We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
01/03/24, 6:01 pm - +263 77 705 6234: Okay that's great news indeed
01/03/24, 6:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so I have an assignment for you, No need to panic as the answers to every question is resting in this chat itself, so make sure if you don't know the answer find it from the chat and then write it down

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
