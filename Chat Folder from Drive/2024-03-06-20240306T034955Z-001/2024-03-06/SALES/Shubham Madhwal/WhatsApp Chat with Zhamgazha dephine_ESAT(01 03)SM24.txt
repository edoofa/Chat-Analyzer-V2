*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
02/03/24, 9:05 am - +263 77 431 9470: thank you sir
02/03/24, 9:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
02/03/24, 9:34 am - +263 77 431 9470: i apreciate that sir
02/03/24, 9:35 am - +263 77 431 9470: thank you so much we will be happy about that program
02/03/24, 9:36 am - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so Dephine, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

To get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

1. *Qualification to the ESAT Exam* (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
2. *A Level and Previous Results* 
3. *Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who can complete their counselling stage within a day has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
4. *Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counselling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
02/03/24, 9:37 am - +263 77 431 9470: yes sir

02/03/24, 1:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, I hope you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program?
02/03/24, 1:46 pm - +263 77 431 9470: ok sit thamk you very much

02/03/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 431 9470: ok i understand sir thank yoi
02/03/24, 1:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now would you like to ask anything?
02/03/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 431 9470: what about if you want your child to go but you does not have that amount you had stated above
02/03/24, 1:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please for that we have our Earn While You Learn Program
02/03/24, 2:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/03/24, 2:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
02/03/24, 2:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
02/03/24, 2:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says consistency is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000 in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
02/03/24, 2:02 pm - +263 77 431 9470: ok thank u
02/03/24, 2:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
02/03/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 431 9470: yes
02/03/24, 2:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
02/03/24, 2:10 pm - +263 77 431 9470: yes
02/03/24, 2:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta also shared about the Enrollment Fee of USD 350 that EDOOFA charges upfront, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
02/03/24, 2:11 pm - +263 77 431 9470: yes
02/03/24, 2:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*
*7. SLICE CON*
*8. Department of Student Welfare*
*9. Attachments and Internship Opportunities*
02/03/24, 2:22 pm - +263 77 431 9470: ok noted
02/03/24, 2:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
02/03/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 431 9470: ok thank u
02/03/24, 2:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Despite, Dephine's Low results of ESAT, I have specially recommended her application for an additional waiver of *USD 50* in your Enrollment Fee upon your consideration in the Slice Con 24 Committee Fund. 

Out of a total of 3000 students only 200 have been given this opportunity, as a counsellor I feel it is a great privilege that has been offered to you.
02/03/24, 2:25 pm - +263 77 431 9470: so she will pay 350+ 50
02/03/24, 2:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: No please, What I mean was the $50 has been waived of on my recommendation, So now the enrollment fees will only be $300
02/03/24, 2:26 pm - +263 77 431 9470: ok sir thank u i understand
02/03/24, 2:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
02/03/24, 2:27 pm - +263 77 431 9470: ok that is better
02/03/24, 2:28 pm - +263 77 431 9470: so how about that 3 000 how is it being paid
02/03/24, 2:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now, let me brief you how the process follows after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
02/03/24, 2:29 pm - +263 77 431 9470: no
02/03/24, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/03/24, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
