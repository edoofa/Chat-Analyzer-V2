02/03/24, 9:05 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
02/03/24, 9:16 am - +263 77 367 3481: Morning
02/03/24, 9:20 am - +44 7707 484312: Good morning
02/03/24, 9:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
02/03/24, 12:25 pm - +44 7707 484312: Thank you so much we are most grateful for your consideration and would love so much for George to be part of family
02/03/24, 12:26 pm - +44 7707 484312: So where do we stand as of now and what is required of us to do
02/03/24, 12:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Okay so George, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

*"The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you. ―B.B. King."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/03/24, 12:20 pm - +263 77 310 8136: Hie sir sorry for the late reply I was
05/03/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 310 8136: In a biology lecture
05/03/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 310 8136: Im ready we can proceed
05/03/24, 12:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So George, As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
05/03/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 310 8136: I haven't researched specifically for India but I  researched Globally and found  that some universities require me to have working experience at hospitals and observe what the medical practitioners will be doing  and that's what I was  doing and  also l have to acquire good A level results but I would be more than happy if you could help me with more detail
05/03/24, 1:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
05/03/24, 2:09 pm - +263 77 367 3481: Since George is already doing chemistry, biology and maths does it automatically mean he is not eligible to study medicine in India.
05/03/24, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please  as the majority of the time, Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

05/03/24, 6:24 pm - +263 77 310 8136: I would like option 1 sir .sir l have a little challenge on the time you have suggested for l will be attending lessons.
05/03/24, 6:30 pm - +263 77 310 8136: But l will try by all means to make myself available in between lessons
