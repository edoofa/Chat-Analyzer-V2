28/02/24, 10:22 am - +260 97 3269733: Edoofa is an Indian based association that offers scholarships to international students in it's quest to offer affordable University Education across the globe. From reviews Edoofa is very credible and has helped a lot of students from Africa and zambia in particular since it's Establishment in 2009.
28/02/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: It's wonderful to know that you have such clarity regarding our program!
28/02/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me further Elaborate about Edoofa Scholarship program to you
28/02/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
28/02/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

28/02/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
28/02/24, 10:27 am - +260 97 3269733: Very competitive.
28/02/24, 10:27 am - +260 97 3269733: This is great.
28/02/24, 10:29 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for John so that just like these students John can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards his higher education by himself and help his parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/02/24, 10:35 am - +260 97 3269733: For sure.University Education is very Expensive here thus most viable and eligible students failing to go ahead with there education.John is not an exception hence has been looking for an opportunity like this one.
28/02/24, 10:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: I can totally resonate with your thoughts @260973269733
28/02/24, 10:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Mr. Tendai, as we start John counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
28/02/24, 10:55 am - +260 97 3269733: As parents we shall do our best and also ensure that he @260977795517  puts the best of his abilities.
28/02/24, 11:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: Amazing Mr. Tendai!
28/02/24, 11:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: You can now introduce John on his behalf!
28/02/24, 11:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so John now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
28/02/24, 11:23 am - +260 97 3269733: John Mwanza is my Biological Son. My First born Son. The mother being Tunile Mbao. John has shown keen interest in School and have no doubt once given an opportunity he will be equal to the Task. His results can do the speaking for him. To avoid pre emptying his introduction, I'll leave it to John to pick it up from here.

28/02/24, 1:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Mr. Tendai
28/02/24, 3:00 pm - +260 97 7795517: .HELLO MR @⁨+91 89204 82888⁩ NICE TO MEET YOU.  MY NAME IS JOHN MWANZA, SON TO @⁨BALLY🤴⁩ AND @⁨+260 96 4744636⁩ . SORRY FOR JOINING A BIT LATE I HAD NETWORK CHALLENGES, I’AM A MALE ZAMBIAN AGED 18 AND I AM BASED IN LUSAKA ZAMBIA. I COMPLETED MY SECONDARY EDUCATION AT LIBALA SECONDARY SCHOOL IN 2022.
I HAVE E INTEREST IN TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT AND AS SUCH, IWOULD LIKE TO PURSUE A CAREER IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMTION TECHNOLOGY OR CYBER SECURITY. EXCEPT FOR INTERESTS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, I ALSO HAVE INTEREST IN BUSINESS STUDIES i.e. ECONOMICS AND FINANCE.
ONE OF MY STRENGTHS IS THAT I AM A DISPLINED AND FAST LEARNER WHO TAKES SERIOUS CONSIDFERATION OF  MY BACKGROUND AND GENERAL PURPOSE OF BEING A STUDENT. FUTHERTMORE I AM QUICK TO ADAPT TO NEW SOCIAL, ECONOMICAL AND ACCADEMIC ENVIROMENTS.  I AM ALSO A TEAM PLAYER WHO VALUES HARD WORK AND CAPACITY BUILDING WITHIN THE TEAM. I CONSIDER MY ABILITY TO APPLY CRITICAL THINKING AS A KEY STRENGHT, AS IT HELPS ME TO OVER COME ANY ACCDEMIC OR SOCIAL CHALLENGE.
HOWEVER, I HAVE A SOCIAL ANXIET WEAKNESS BUT I TRY MY BEST TO QUICKLY OVERCOME IT AND ADAPT TO NEW ENVIROMENT.  MY OTHER WEAKNESS IS MY DESIRE TO GET THINGS DONE WITHIN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME THEREBY STRESSING MYSELF.
MY PARENTS ARE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH AND RAISED ME IN A RELIGIOUS HOME. OUR HOUSEHOLD IS ONE THAT UPHOLDS MORALS VALUES. MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN SO HELPFUL AND HAVE RAISED ME TO BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING IS ACHIEVABLE ONCE YOU DO TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITIES. 
 BEING THE ELDEST CHILD IN A FAMILY 3 AND BEING THE ONLY MALE , I FEEL COMPELLED TO SET A GOOD EXAMPLE BOTH ACCADEMICALLY AND SOCIALLY TO MY YOUNGER SIBLINGS. I THERFORE HOPE TO BE THE ONE THAT BREAKS THE ECONOMICAL AND FINANCIAL BARRIERS THAT AFFECT MY FAMILY, AS MY FATHER IN THE ONLY ONE WORKING IN LOW RANKING GOVERMNENT POSITION AND MY MOTHER IS NOT FORMALLY EMPLOYED THEREBY NOT  CONTRIBUTING  TO  THE  FINANCIAL ASPECT OF MY EDUCATION. 
IN MY FREE TIME I ENJOY NATURE WALKS, READING BOOKS AND PLAYING BASKETBALL AS THIS  HELPS ME RELEASE THE STRESS THAT COME WITH LIFES SHORTFALLS.
28/02/24, 4:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

29/02/24, 2:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/02/24, 2:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 2:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/02/24, 2:55 pm - +260 97 3269733: Is this the net cost after the scholarship has been given. The one met by parents?
29/02/24, 2:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: See In simple words John what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/02/24, 3:03 pm - +260 97 3269733: Ok understood.
29/02/24, 3:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now i shall brief you about the *Earn While You Learn Program.*?
29/02/24, 3:12 pm - +260 97 7795517: Understood.
29/02/24, 3:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
29/02/24, 3:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/02/24, 3:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/02/24, 3:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

29/02/24, 3:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
29/02/24, 3:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am expecting your response to this @260977795517
29/02/24, 3:45 pm - +260 97 7795517: This is such an extraordinary program, looking at what others have achieved while studying is really amazing. I feel I can do the same .
29/02/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that John, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/02/24, 3:48 pm - +260 97 7795517: Amazing.
29/02/24, 3:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/02/24, 3:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
29/02/24, 3:54 pm - +260 97 7795517: Yes sir its really different and helpful too
29/02/24, 3:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could understand what I intended to share with you so that I can help you and guide you to secure maximum scholarship for your education and you do wonders ahead!
29/02/24, 3:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: To summarize this means the more you work hard and do your projects and tasks in EWYL program the more you get paid for it in the form of scholarship credits and reduce your fee as much as you can!
29/02/24, 3:59 pm - +260 97 7795517: Well understood sir really thankful
29/02/24, 4:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You are welcome!
29/02/24, 4:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright @260977795517 @260973269733 @260964744636 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
29/02/24, 4:05 pm - +260 97 3269733: Ready
29/02/24, 4:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @260977795517 @260973269733 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/02/24, 4:08 pm - +260 97 3269733: Between $1500-$2250
29/02/24, 4:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Mr. Tendai, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/02/24, 4:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 4:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/02/24, 4:13 pm - +260 97 3269733: Quiet fair.
29/02/24, 4:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/02/24, 4:14 pm - +260 97 3269733: Great
29/02/24, 4:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/02/24, 4:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
29/02/24, 4:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Mr. Tendai, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/02/24, 4:22 pm - +260 97 3269733: Ok
29/02/24, 4:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes @260973269733 and I hope that you and @260977795517 have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
29/02/24, 4:26 pm - +260 97 3269733: Yes I get it. Along the way it's the student hard efforts that cushion a parents burden.
29/02/24, 4:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Mr. Tendai!
29/02/24, 4:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we are in the last phase of counseling session and it is about to end and only one aspect of the program is left to be explained
29/02/24, 4:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like you to see this video before that!
29/02/24, 4:30 pm - +260 97 7795517: Understood
29/02/24, 4:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 4:35 pm - +260 97 7795517: Nice
29/02/24, 4:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you want to be the part of the Edoofa family soon?
29/02/24, 4:41 pm - +260 97 7795517: Yes hopefully
29/02/24, 4:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and en
roll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
29/02/24, 4:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 4:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright @260977795517 @260973269733 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself. <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 4:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
29/02/24, 4:51 pm - +260 97 7795517: Clear
29/02/24, 4:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/02/24, 4:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
29/02/24, 4:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
29/02/24, 4:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 4:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
29/02/24, 4:55 pm - +260 97 3269733: Yes
29/02/24, 4:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, I want to ask if is there anything you would like me to address?
29/02/24, 4:59 pm - +260 97 3269733: For now it's quiet clear.
29/02/24, 4:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
29/02/24, 4:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *Saturday at 9:30 AM * I will also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *I have also shared the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt.

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
05/03/24, 3:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am expecting your response please @260977795517
05/03/24, 3:27 pm - +260 97 7795517: 1. Computer science Engineering.
2. Would perusing higher education in India. 
3. $8000-$25000 on average  without any scholarship .
4. Through the EWYL program a student tuition and living is reduced to $2000-$3000 per year which can be further reduced to $1000 
5. Once accepted students are requested to pay a nominal fee of $350 that's within 7 days of being accepted 
6. Due to the economic hardship edoofa has recognized parents can pay $200 within 7 days and $150 in the next 30 days .
7. No sir please break it down .
05/03/24, 3:35 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Registration fee would be between $500-$1000, basically if you recall I did brief you after your university interaction with multiple universities, you would have to reserve your seat in 1 particular university you would have to pay a registration fee. Now usually Registration fee for a student is a separate expense altogether, however for an Edoofian it is considered a part of the first year's annual fee.

Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments.
05/03/24, 3:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are able to understand now?
05/03/24, 3:44 pm - +260 97 7795517: Oh I totally understand
05/03/24, 3:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: To proceed ahead for the eligibility interview stage you need to appear for a test which is of 30-45 minutes!

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s.
