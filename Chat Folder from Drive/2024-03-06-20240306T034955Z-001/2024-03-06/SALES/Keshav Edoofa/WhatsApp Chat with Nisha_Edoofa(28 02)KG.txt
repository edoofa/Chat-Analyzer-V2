02/03/24, 12:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall brief you about the Edoofa scholarship program to you all!
02/03/24, 12:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
02/03/24, 12:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/03/24, 12:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
02/03/24, 12:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 12:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
02/03/24, 12:19 pm - +27 64 476 8864: Can we start the session
02/03/24, 12:23 pm - +27 64 476 8864: Impressive
02/03/24, 12:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
02/03/24, 12:27 pm - +27 64 476 8864: True.Am answering on behalf of my daughter. Am sure she got network problems
02/03/24, 12:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its Alright Mr. Philip
02/03/24, 12:31 pm - +27 64 476 8864: She's online
02/03/24, 12:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so @263787428824 @27644768864 , as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
02/03/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 742 8824: I'm here now
02/03/24, 12:32 pm - +27 64 476 8864: Ok thanks
02/03/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 742 8824: Ok .can we proceed
02/03/24, 12:36 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Nisha, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
02/03/24, 12:53 pm - +263 78 742 8824: Firstly, I am a girl of 18 .I'm the first born in my family. I did my ordinary level  at Musirizwi Secondary  school in Chipinge, and I furthered Advanced level studies at Sakubva 1 High school in Mutare. 
I wish to study medical sciences. I came from a poor background. There are four children in my family, including me and my two little sisters and a boy who is the last born .
My parents ( mom and Dad ) are in South africa, where they work, trying to provide us with anything they can help us with. They are self-employed.
02/03/24, 12:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you for introducing yourself @263787428824
02/03/24, 12:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Can you shed some more light on your parents background, their education and their profession?
02/03/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 742 8824: My father grew up in the countryside, and his level of education is an ordinary level .he also did his ordinary level at Musirizwi secondary school.  That's when he started to do some peace jobs around Zimbabwe. That's when he met my mother. 
My mother grew up in mutare .her level of education is also an ordinary level .she did not have anybody to support her education further since her parents were divorced and she was living with her stepmother .
After that, she started working in Mutare as a housemaid until she met my father
02/03/24, 1:05 pm - +263 78 742 8824: They don't have a specific job since they are not qualified.they do everything as long as it provides them with money
02/03/24, 1:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright @263787428824
02/03/24, 1:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your secondary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad? <This message was edited>
02/03/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 742 8824: The government always pays school fees for those who can't afford via beam, that what they call it, so since form one, they helped me till the examinations they even pay for examination fee.  
As for the advanced level , One of my ordinary level teacher helps my father by paying half of the school fees and my father paid the other  half .it was my father who   also provide stationary and food
02/03/24, 1:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know how as a family are you planning financially for your higher education abroad?
02/03/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 742 8824: My father  said he will find a way no matter what
02/03/24, 1:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
02/03/24, 1:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We at Edoofa provide scholarship to students and not sponsorships
02/03/24, 1:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain with to you with an example, Avg cost of education in India is 7-8000$ which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 25,000-30000$ , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 2-3000$ per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food! <This message was edited>
02/03/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 742 8824: Ok
02/03/24, 1:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Is your parents financially prepared for the same?
02/03/24, 1:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @27644768864
02/03/24, 1:33 pm - +27 64 476 8864: Not prepared as the amount is much higher
02/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *Monday again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care

05/03/24, 10:43 am - Keshav Edoofa: Will you be able to manage the cost of education after our assistantship of the scholarship duly told by me to you?
05/03/24, 4:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
