20/02/24, 9:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me further Elaborate about Edoofa Scholarship program to you
20/02/24, 9:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/02/24, 9:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/02/24, 9:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/02/24, 9:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
20/02/24, 9:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/02/24, 9:55 am - +265 992 59 10 08: Okay nice to see this its a really nice
20/02/24, 9:55 am - +265 992 59 10 08: Have read it all
20/02/24, 9:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/02/24, 10:02 am - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes it is
20/02/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Praise, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
20/02/24, 10:07 am - +265 992 59 10 08: Okay I get it will manage to do that
20/02/24, 10:08 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Praise, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
20/02/24, 10:20 am - +265 992 59 10 08: Okay my full name is praise leman currently staying in lilongwe malawi  , I attended my secondary school school at sostengwengwe foundation after finishing my secondary I went to livingstonia collage which I dint proceed due to fees that is when I applied for this scholarship.

Talking about my family is that I was raised in a family that always wanted me to stay with my grandmother and I am the only child they have . my parents do business mostly agricultural type of business that all I can explain for now

20/02/24, 11:12 am - +265 992 59 10 08: About school there was nothing I was just informed by my parents not to go because the amount of money they had they could not afford the school again
20/02/24, 12:20 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: But no other challege
21/02/24, 4:39 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Hello
22/02/24, 6:33 am - +265 992 59 10 08: Good morning
22/02/24, 10:28 am - Keshav Edoofa: @265992591008 @265993598889 
Good morning to you
How are you please, shall we resume our discussion?
22/02/24, 10:35 am - +265 992 59 10 08: Am fine and how are you
22/02/24, 10:35 am - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes we can resume
22/02/24, 11:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
22/02/24, 11:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: We at Edoofa provide scholarship to students and not sponsorships
22/02/24, 11:18 am - Keshav Edoofa: See I will explain with to you with an example, Avg cost of education in India is 7-8000$ which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 25,000-30000$ , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 2-3000$ per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food! <This message was edited>
22/02/24, 11:35 am - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes that true they is a  difrence between the two
22/02/24, 11:35 am - +265 992 59 10 08: Okay I get that
22/02/24, 11:52 am - Keshav Edoofa: Are you financially prepared for the same @265992591008 @265993598889 ?
22/02/24, 12:00 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes we are prepared

28/02/24, 10:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: The correlation between geography and agriculture degrees can be seen in the context of the interdisciplinary nature of agricultural studies. Geography plays a significant role in agriculture as it involves understanding the spatial distribution of land, climate patterns, soil types, and topography, all of which are crucial factors influencing agricultural practices.

Here are some points highlighting the correlation between geography and agriculture degrees:

Spatial Analysis: Geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies are frequently used in agriculture to analyze and interpret spatial data. This helps in making informed decisions related to crop selection, land use planning, and resource management.

Climate and Agriculture: Geography provides insights into climate patterns, which are vital for determining suitable crops for specific regions. Agricultural practices are often tailored to the local climate, and understanding the geographical aspects of climate is essential for successful farming.

Soil Science: Geography contributes to the study of soil science, helping farmers understand the distribution of different soil types. The knowledge of soil composition and characteristics is crucial for optimizing agricultural practices and choosing appropriate crops.

Land Use Planning: Geographers play a role in land use planning, which is essential for sustainable agriculture. They help identify areas suitable for cultivation, conservation, or other land uses, taking into consideration geographical factors such as terrain and water availability.

Global Agriculture Systems: Geographical perspectives are crucial in understanding global agricultural systems, trade patterns, and food security. Geographers contribute to analyzing the distribution of agricultural products, identifying global trends, and addressing challenges related to food production and distribution.

Rural Development: Geography is linked to rural development, and agriculture often serves as a backbone for rural economies. Understanding the geographical aspects of rural areas helps in formulating policies for sustainable development and improving agricultural practices.

Cultural and Historical Aspects: Geographical factors often influence the cultural and historical development of agriculture in specific regions. A degree in geography can provide insights into how cultural practices and historical developments have shaped agricultural landscapes.

In summary, geography and agriculture are closely intertwined, and a degree in either field can enhance one's understanding of the spatial and environmental factors that influence agricultural practices. This interdisciplinary approach is valuable for addressing the complex challenges faced by the agricultural sector

28/02/24, 12:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we shall we proceed ahead!
28/02/24, 12:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
28/02/24, 12:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/02/24, 12:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/02/24, 12:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 12:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/02/24, 12:22 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Okay I understand
28/02/24, 12:24 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Oo okay that is nice
28/02/24, 12:24 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: I understand
28/02/24, 12:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Praise what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/02/24, 12:28 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Okay I get it its really nice a nice program of the earn while you earn
28/02/24, 12:28 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Earn while you learn *
28/02/24, 1:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall explain you about the Earn while you learn program in detail!
28/02/24, 1:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
28/02/24, 1:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
28/02/24, 1:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
28/02/24, 1:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

28/02/24, 1:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
28/02/24, 1:20 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: I have read it and I see that it is really beneficial
28/02/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Did you see the posters as well?
28/02/24, 1:22 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes I have seen then it seams they benefited
28/02/24, 1:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Praise, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/02/24, 1:36 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Oo okay thats nice
28/02/24, 1:39 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: That means the more u work had the more you get paid
28/02/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Praise
28/02/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/02/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
28/02/24, 1:50 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes it is
28/02/24, 1:50 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: You have the good services
28/02/24, 1:50 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: I like it
28/02/24, 1:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you and Mr. Leman understand about the aspects of the EWYL program and the benefits it entails
28/02/24, 1:52 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes we do all understand
28/02/24, 1:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This means the more you work hard and do your projects and tasks in EWYL program the more you get paid for it in the form of scholarship credits and reduce your fee as much as you can!
28/02/24, 1:59 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Okay that is nice then
28/02/24, 2:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
28/02/24, 2:07 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes I am
28/02/24, 2:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Praise as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/02/24, 2:13 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: The student can spent a huge sum of money
28/02/24, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Praise and it will be around 2000$ and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/02/24, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 2:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
28/02/24, 2:16 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Ooo okay I understand
28/02/24, 2:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/02/24, 2:20 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes I do
28/02/24, 2:20 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: That mean one pays all fees in a single fee
28/02/24, 2:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes thats right Praise and all these benefits you can avail only 350$ along with the EWYL program access!
28/02/24, 2:22 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Oo okay nice
28/02/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/02/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
28/02/24, 2:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Praise, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.* <This message was edited>
28/02/24, 2:27 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: I really like the payment schedule I do understand
28/02/24, 2:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well Praise, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
28/02/24, 2:30 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes
28/02/24, 2:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Before we conclude our session with the explanation of Edoofa cycle I want you to look at this video!
28/02/24, 2:32 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/02/24, 2:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could understand what I intended to share with you so that I can help you and guide you to secure maximum scholarship for your education and you do wonders ahead!
28/02/24, 2:41 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Okay I get you

28/02/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
28/02/24, 2:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 2:56 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Oo okay I get it I have understood
28/02/24, 2:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Praise, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Malawi itself.
28/02/24, 2:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
28/02/24, 3:01 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes I do understand
28/02/24, 3:02 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Its all clear
28/02/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
28/02/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
28/02/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
28/02/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/02/24, 3:06 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, I want to ask if is there anything you would like me to address?

28/02/24, 3:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*_SECTION 2 READING TEST_*

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

29/02/24, 1:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Can you Mr. Leman be online to answer my few questions meanwhile I will get Praise answers evaluated! <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 1:59 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Okay let me tell him
29/02/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure
29/02/24, 2:01 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Hello mr leman
29/02/24, 2:01 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Am here
29/02/24, 2:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. leman you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
29/02/24, 2:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
29/02/24, 2:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
29/02/24, 2:11 pm - +265 992 59 10 08: Yes I am very willing to support him
29/02/24, 2:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
29/02/24, 2:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 2:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 6th or 7th of March 2024 for $200 and the 6th or 7th of April for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 6th or 7th of March 2024
