14/02/24, 10:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me further Elaborate about Edoofa Scholarship program to you
14/02/24, 10:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
14/02/24, 10:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14/02/24, 10:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
14/02/24, 10:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.

14/02/24, 11:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
14/02/24, 11:03 am - +263 71 773 3322: Yes it is
14/02/24, 11:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Patience, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout the session

In addition  to that I would  also help in the development of clinics in my community
20/02/24, 11:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is really great Patience, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination?
20/02/24, 11:45 am - +263 71 773 3322: Yes l am wondering
20/02/24, 11:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

20/02/24, 11:56 am - +263 71 773 3322: I'm done
20/02/24, 12:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
20/02/24, 12:09 pm - +263 71 773 3322: No
20/02/24, 12:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
20/02/24, 12:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/02/24, 12:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/02/24, 12:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/02/24, 12:10 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/02/24, 12:17 pm - +263 71 773 3322: I'm done
20/02/24, 12:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Patience what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $2000-$3000, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program* <This message was edited>
20/02/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Okay
20/02/24, 12:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall i brief you about the EWYL program?
20/02/24, 12:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are getting hold of the information i am sharing with you @263717733322
20/02/24, 12:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Also i hope @263771181456 @263773903058 you are following up on your child's counseling session as well!
20/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Yes
20/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Yeah I'm following
20/02/24, 1:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
20/02/24, 1:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.

20/02/24, 1:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/02/24, 1:26 pm - +263 77 390 3058: Yes
20/02/24, 1:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that @263773903058 , moving further now if I have to help you and @263717733322 explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/02/24, 1:38 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Yes it will definitely benefit me
20/02/24, 1:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/02/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/02/24, 1:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

20/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 77 390 3058: Mr Keshav I really thank you so much for elaborating the edoofa educational facilities and approach
20/02/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could understand what I intended to share with you so that I can help you and guide you to secure maximum scholarship for your education and you do wonders ahead!
20/02/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 390 3058: When does your intake recruite
20/02/24, 2:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you as a parent are keeping track of your child's future opportunity that awaits for him to get him able to be successful ahead

Also, I really appreciate your efforts and support for your child's education, you are awesome, Kudos!
20/02/24, 2:06 pm - +263 71 773 3322: That's exactly l was looking for
20/02/24, 2:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright @263773903058 @263717733322 , basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
20/02/24, 2:51 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Okay
20/02/24, 2:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Patience as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/02/24, 2:59 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Approximately $1500-$2250
20/02/24, 3:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Patience, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/02/24, 3:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/02/24, 3:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 773 3322: So you are saying l have to pay $350
20/02/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Or $750
20/02/24, 3:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Only for sometime this offer is given to students of 350$ instead of 750$
20/02/24, 3:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/02/24, 3:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: All of this along with EWYL is accessible for 350$ <This message was edited>
20/02/24, 3:13 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Okay
20/02/24, 3:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Dont you think so Patience
20/02/24, 3:14 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Yes Sir
20/02/24, 3:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We have already helped thousands of students to pursue their dream of having quality education abroad at the lowest cost possible
20/02/24, 3:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As your counselor i want to help you and guide you to secure maximum scholarship for your education and you do wonders ahead!
20/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 71 773 3322: So how is it paid?
20/02/24, 3:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/02/24, 3:17 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Okay
20/02/24, 3:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
20/02/24, 3:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However Patience, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Noted
20/02/24, 3:23 pm - +263 71 773 3322: So l first receive an acceptance letter before paying right?
20/02/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes that correct's Patience
20/02/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Also I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
20/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 71 773 3322: How does it depends?
20/02/24, 3:24 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Okay thanks
20/02/24, 3:25 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The more you put in the hard work completing tasks and projects you will be rewarded that amount of scholarship credits!
20/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Hooo okay I get you
20/02/24, 3:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we have reached the end part of your counseling and only one aspect is left to be explained!
20/02/24, 3:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
20/02/24, 3:27 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Following
20/02/24, 3:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/02/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Patience, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
20/02/24, 3:28 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/02/24, 3:32 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Okay great
20/02/24, 3:33 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Yes
20/02/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/02/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
20/02/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
20/02/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/02/24, 3:34 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake
20/02/24, 3:36 pm - +263 71 773 3322: So how much do l have to pay altogether
20/02/24, 3:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You shall be paying the enrollment fee of 350$ to get enrolled in our program!
20/02/24, 3:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall send you a summarized picture of all the financial aspects involved!
20/02/24, 3:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/02/24, 3:45 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Noted
20/02/24, 3:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, I want to ask if is there anything you would like me to address?

I hope @263773903058 @263771181456 you are keeping a follow-up on your child's counseling session!?
20/02/24, 3:51 pm - +263 77 390 3058: Yes I am there
20/02/24, 3:52 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Would anyone of you @263717733322 @263771181456 @263773903058 like to ask anything about any aspect of the program that you want me to clarify?
20/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Okay so how long does it take for one to get the admission letter
20/02/24, 4:01 pm - +263 77 390 3058: To tell Mr Keshav your program I like it but now  I will request a special arrange ment
20/02/24, 4:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: If you are found eligible and pass the interview stage and the scholarship test you will be given the acceptance letter of the Edoofa program and once you complete the payment formalities your application will be handed over to the admissions team and they will send your application to different universities!
20/02/24, 4:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Kindly go ahead Mr. Joe
20/02/24, 4:07 pm - +263 71 773 3322: Okay

20/02/24, 4:12 pm - +263 71 773 3322: For now no

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

A man who has no goal is like a ship without radder, so says Thomas Carlye , a Scottish. I agree . Everyone needs to have a goal in life. Having this goal gives us  purpose and focus in life. So to set that goal l asked myself what l want to do for myself,my family and my country.

As l grew up seeing those in the medical field my heart skipped a bit with happiness. At first I wasn't sure if that was what I want bt as time moved, my parents helped me to realize that was what I adore. They gave me full support, time and everything that I wanted during my studies. I grew to love and cherish sciences. When I wrote my form 4  l started living with my parents at their working place. Those in the medical field visited us frequently , they  are the ones who inspired me most. They would  encourage me to do anything that has to do with Health.They usually call me doctor and that gave me more power and  courage to persevere and focus on my goal.  That's when I finally realize that I wanted this department. And l set a  goal. Having this goal  in life makes one thing clear to me .l will not live for myself but for others.l must do my best in everything l do . And now I am a ship with a radder and hard work is going to get me to me destination.

Life in Rwanda after 16 years of genocide  has been marked by progress, resilience and transformation.Rwanda has undergone significant changes, demonstrating an extraordinary journey of recovery, healing and development.

The government and communities have strived  to Foster a sence  of national cohesion. Initiatives such as the Gacaca courts, which are set up to try genocide-related cases and promote reconciliation at the community level, have played a crucial role in the healing process.  In addition Rwanda has made important effort to promote national identity and unity

Economically, the country has experienced consistent economic growth and as a result , poverty rates have declined. It is also promoting gender equality and women's empowerment with women holding a high percentage of seats in the parliament.

In terms of governance , it has implemented various reforms aimed at combating corruption and promoting good governance. The country has commended for it's effort in embracing technology and innovation to derive progress and development. Rwanda has emerged as a leader in environmental sustainability. The country has implemented initiatives to protect it's natural resources and promote conservation.

Despite these incredible advancement, challenges persists. While efforts are being made to promote national unity there is ongoing work to further solidify social cohesion and address to lingering effects of the genocide on the fabric of Rwanda society.

In a nutshell ,16 years after genocide , Rwanda has made a remarkable progress in various aspects of it's societal and economic development. It's focus on reconciliation, economic growth, good governance, technological innovation and environmental sustainability has been outstanding. The healing process is still on going

22/02/24, 11:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: @263773903058
22/02/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 390 3058: Yes go ahead
22/02/24, 11:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Joe, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT. <This message was edited>
22/02/24, 11:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
22/02/24, 11:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
22/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 77 390 3058: Yes
22/02/24, 11:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Mr. Joe i am happy for @263717733322 that you are willing to support her to the fullest , i have full confidence in Patience once she is part of the program she will do wonders in her career
22/02/24, 11:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/02/24, 11:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
22/02/24, 11:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/02/24, 11:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 28th or 29th of February 2024 for $200 and the 28th or 29th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 28th or 29th of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
22/02/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 390 3058: Option 1

28/02/24, 1:17 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am expecting your response @263773903058 @263717733322
28/02/24, 1:21 pm - +263 71 773 3322: On my side it's clear
28/02/24, 1:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright and @263773903058 Mr. Joe?
29/02/24, 9:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning @263773903058 @263717733322
29/02/24, 9:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are doing well
29/02/24, 9:06 am - +263 71 773 3322: Yeah l am fine
29/02/24, 9:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can i have @263773903058 online so i can explain the payment method to him?
29/02/24, 9:37 am - +263 77 390 3058: Yes go ahead
29/02/24, 9:48 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright @263773903058 @263717733322 , so as you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
Or shall i explain you both the methods?
29/02/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 390 3058: 1
29/02/24, 10:19 am - Keshav Edoofa: Mr. Joe @263773903058 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.
29/02/24, 10:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: There is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
29/02/24, 10:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC
