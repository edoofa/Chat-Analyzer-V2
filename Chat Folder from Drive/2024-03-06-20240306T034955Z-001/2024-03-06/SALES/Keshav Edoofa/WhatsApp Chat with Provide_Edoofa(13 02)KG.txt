14/02/24, 10:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me further Elaborate about Edoofa Scholarship program to you
14/02/24, 10:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
14/02/24, 10:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
14/02/24, 10:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
14/02/24, 10:09 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.

28/02/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Sure provide I being your counselor will help and guide you throughout the session so that you can achieve the maximum scholarship through our program!
28/02/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/02/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 473 8679: Yaaa thats true
28/02/24, 1:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Fantastic
28/02/24, 1:25 pm - +263 78 473 8679: Your support is greatly appreciated and I will try to endure it, otherwise can you highlight the steps taken through this session
28/02/24, 1:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I shall brief you about the entire process and details with you while we move ahead in the session!
28/02/24, 1:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Provide, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
28/02/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 473 8679: Okay I understand ,but the issue is that my father had no access to WhatsApp or Internet networks so my mother Agnes will be available throughout the counselling
28/02/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 473 8679: So Mr keshav can we chat tomorrow and I am sure my mother would be back by tomorrow
28/02/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Provide
28/02/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 473 8679: Thank you Sir
28/02/24, 1:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You're welcome

29/02/24, 11:41 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Provide, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
29/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 473 8679: Well my full name is Provide Mambowatema ,I am 21 years old and I am from a family of two children while I am the first one.Both of my parents are alive and some other many relatives who lives in different towns and villages inside Zimbabwe.

I finished my ordinary level in 2019 and I came with 6 passed subjects 
 include English Language,Science,Geography,History,Agriculture(practical) and Shona language.
Due to financial problems I delayed to go to Advanced Level but letter managed to continue whereas I finished my A level in 2022 in which I passed the three required subjects that are Geography (C) ,History(B)  and Sociology(A)symbols.
 I grew up in a communal/rural area where there are few educational services offered since these areas are not well developed in terms of industries and better schooling equipments.So as for now I wish to continue with education specified in Development Studies since vision is to make the communal areas well developed just like towns and cities
29/02/24, 12:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Thank you for your introduction @263784738679
29/02/24, 12:27 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Can you please shed some light on your parents background, education level and their profession?
29/02/24, 12:41 pm - +263 78 473 8679: About my parents ,they are self employed meaning they are not employed in any company .My mother is a vendor and my father engage in some piece jobs to earn a living so l can say life is guite difficulty for us sometimes.Actually my relatives helped us sometimes with what they could.
I actually practice seasonal agriculture with help from my parents but due to lack of capital and inputs this result in lower yields.
29/02/24, 12:42 pm - +263 78 473 8679: If there is something you need to know you free to ask
29/02/24, 1:00 pm - +263 78 473 8679: Well all my parents are not well educated and they not professionals at all and they are also from poor family background.
But my my is quite better since she reached advanced level
29/02/24, 1:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Provide, thank you so much for the details
29/02/24, 1:58 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May i know how are you and your family is planning to go ahead with your higher education abroad financially?
29/02/24, 2:39 pm - +263 78 473 8679: Me and my family have totally put so much trust on your scholarship offers and we are willing to support on every need required from the family that's all
29/02/24, 2:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
29/02/24, 2:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We at Edoofa provide scholarship to students and not sponsorships
29/02/24, 2:55 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain with to you with an example, Avg cost of education in India is 7-8000$ which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 25,000-30000$ , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 2-3000$ per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food! <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 4:11 pm - +263 78 473 8679: Thank you very much for making it clear to me ,I had never known what exactly scholarship means and now I understand.Therefore I will explain this to my parents and their response will determine what we are going to do
29/02/24, 4:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Provide
29/02/24, 4:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad i could make you understand
