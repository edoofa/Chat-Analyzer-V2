09/02/24, 9:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Before i elaborate about Edoofa scholarship program to you i want to know about your understanding regarding the same as you learnt from Tinotendaishe.
09/02/24, 9:44 am - +263 77 495 7402: My understanding is that EDOOFA is a scholarship program that helps students to reduce their university payment and it offers many opportunities.This is done through the EWYL program.It is a well known program in the SADC nations and in Africa.
09/02/24, 9:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is wonderful Christine
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall briefly elaborate about Edoofa scholarship program to you!
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/02/24, 9:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs.

09/02/24, 9:59 am - +263 77 495 7402: Understood
09/02/24, 10:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/02/24, 10:03 am - +263 77 495 7402: Yes Sir
09/02/24, 10:15 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Christine, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
09/02/24, 3:22 pm - +263 77 495 7402: Yes I'm willing to do so
09/02/24, 3:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
09/02/24, 3:47 pm - +263 77 495 7402: I am interested in studying abroad  because I will be able to  access the best programs and the best universities with the best facilities that suits  my program.It would also help me improve in language skills  and after graduation I could get the opportunity to explore my knowledge to reputable organisations across the globe . It will provide me with job opportunities and exposure. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe including food and accommodation. And today, the internet is a necessity and abroad it is more cheaper and readily available compared to my country.
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.
09/02/24, 3:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I duly understand what you are sharing and resonate with the same also i realize you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.
09/02/24, 3:56 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you are aware that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination?

As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
10/02/24, 9:31 am - +263 77 495 7402: No not at all Sir
10/02/24, 9:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: No questions right Christine or you do not proper understanding till now?
10/02/24, 9:34 am - +263 77 495 7402: I do understand
10/02/24, 9:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then in that case
10/02/24, 9:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
10/02/24, 9:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
10/02/24, 9:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
10/02/24, 9:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 9:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
10/02/24, 9:52 am - +263 77 495 7402: Thank you .I really understood that educational costs are too high in other countries and it is difficult for most students to achieve their dreams.
10/02/24, 9:57 am - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Christine what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
10/02/24, 9:58 am - +263 77 495 7402: My you please enlighten me more about the earn while you learn program
10/02/24, 9:58 am - Keshav Edoofa: Sure I will Christine
10/02/24, 9:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
10/02/24, 9:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

10/02/24, 9:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
10/02/24, 9:59 am - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

10/02/24, 10:00 am - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
10/02/24, 10:06 am - +263 77 495 7402: Yes I think it will really benefit me a lot
10/02/24, 10:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could resonate with it
10/02/24, 10:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that Christine, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
10/02/24, 10:10 am - +263 77 495 7402: This would be a good opportunity to lighten my parent's burden
10/02/24, 10:11 am - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

10/02/24, 10:12 am - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
10/02/24, 10:15 am - +263 77 495 7402: Yes it is what I have been looking for
10/02/24, 10:15 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could understand what I intended to share with you so that I can help you and guide you to secure maximum scholarship for your education and you do wonders ahead!
10/02/24, 10:17 am - +263 77 495 7402: Thank you sir I really appreciate
10/02/24, 11:07 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
10/02/24, 11:11 am - +263 77 495 7402: Yes sir
10/02/24, 11:13 am - Keshav Edoofa: Christine as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
10/02/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 495 7402: $1500-$2250
10/02/24, 11:44 am - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Christine, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
10/02/24, 11:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/02/24, 11:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
10/02/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 495 7402: So this means that the  application fee is $350 right ?
12/02/24, 10:32 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning @263774957402 sorry for the delayed response, my device had some challenges
12/02/24, 10:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: @263775358899 How are you please, i hope you are in good health
12/02/24, 10:35 am - +263 77 535 8899: Good morning Sir. We are all fine.
12/02/24, 10:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/02/24, 10:39 am - +263 77 495 7402: Good morning Mr Keshav
12/02/24, 10:42 am - Keshav Edoofa: How are you Christine?
12/02/24, 10:43 am - +263 77 495 7402: I'm good and you sir
12/02/24, 10:45 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Christine and excited to continue the session with you
12/02/24, 10:46 am - Keshav Edoofa: Also, i must say you have been active and responsive through out the session which will be definitely taken into consideration of your scholarship quantum
12/02/24, 10:47 am - +263 77 495 7402: Thank you sir
12/02/24, 10:48 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/02/24, 10:48 am - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
12/02/24, 10:48 am - Keshav Edoofa: However Christine, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/02/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 495 7402: Understood
12/02/24, 10:51 am - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well Christine, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
12/02/24, 10:53 am - +263 77 495 7402: Yes sir
12/02/24, 10:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
12/02/24, 10:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/02/24, 10:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Christine, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
12/02/24, 10:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 77 495 7402: Understood sir <This message was edited>

14/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 535 8899: Would it be strictly that all Edoofian stay on compass or they will be free to choose where to stay.
14/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 77 535 8899: I also wanted to ask for other expenses that may be required  for her upkeep.

16/02/24, 12:47 pm - +263 77 535 8899: This message was deleted
16/02/24, 12:49 pm - +263 77 535 8899: Good morning Sir how are you.Is  350.00 mentioned on this paragraph the same as the costs that have been mentioned in step 6 that was discussed on Monday.
16/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 77 535 8899: Sir how would we know that Christine has qualified to become an Edoofian.
16/02/24, 1:27 pm - +263 77 535 8899: Sir I am coming back to you with other questions again.I was tied up the last days, So today I was going through the whole conselling cessions and I came with following questions which If you explain to me clearly it would help  understand more. As I was going through your documents, I had understood that the scholarship is being offered depending on the outcome of your conselling cessions and that the remainder of the tution fees will be paid by the student.                                         Then my questions are as follows,    How many semesters are there in a year ? So if Christine is awarded a scholarship this mean that Edoofa would part of the fees per semester.                                            Does the Edoofa scholarship cater for tution, accommodation and food.                                                     I had taken note that the student will be required to pay the remainder of the fees after Edoofa had paid.Will the payments done at once or the student will be given time to complete payments.                      Are the fees for accommodation and food stand alone fees?                               Does costs  for accommodation  charged per semester ?                                    Will the student be required to buy own food or it the food will paid for?                                        I understand that universities have got other related costs which are not part to the tution will the Edoofa scholarship cater for such costs or student has to pay separately?                  Does the scholarship  require the student to pay other fees before enrollment other than the stated 350.00.
19/02/24, 8:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning @263774957402 @263775358899
19/02/24, 8:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: How are you, please?
19/02/24, 8:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Sorry for the delayed response, please
19/02/24, 8:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: I had some challenges with my device
19/02/24, 8:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Shall we continue with your application, please?
19/02/24, 8:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: I have gone through all of your doubts Mrs. Sibuyile and they are absolutely natural questions that parents must have
19/02/24, 8:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall share all the financial aspects with you in a comprehensive manner again with you and all the assistance included in it!
19/02/24, 8:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/02/24, 8:34 am - Keshav Edoofa: Referring to this image let me re-explain the financial aspect of the program in 3 parts.

1. The Enrollment fee is $350 which includes application forms, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, visa assistance, Earn While You Learn Program's training etc.

2. The Registration fee would be between $500-$1000, basically if you recall I did brief you after your university interaction with multiple universities, you would have to reserve your seat in 1 particular university you would have to pay a registration fee. Now usually Registration fee for a student is a separate expense altogether, however for an Edoofian it is considered a part of the first year's annual fee.

Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-25 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-26.

3. The Annual fee after the scholarship as discussed above would be between $2000-$3000, and this would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee However if a student is able to clear the Eligibility Check test and Interview with over 90 marks, a student is eligible to get a 90% to 100% scholarship where the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between $1250-$1500, which would include Accommodation, Food Expenses, and Basic University Expenses such as exam fees, Library Fee, and Lab Fee
19/02/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 495 7402: Good morning sir ,we are all fine here
19/02/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 495 7402: How are you

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Write a short essay in about 500 words 

*_TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?_*

 Rwanda has rebuilt itself in the aftermath of that tragedy, setting itself apart from other developing nations by intelligently, efficiently, and transparently making the most of other nations’ investments and creating the building blocks of success in agriculture, social services, entrepreneurship, and basic infrastructure. From AIDS/HIV to family health, its hard pressed to find a nation that’s shown better results for the money spent in improving health care fundamentals. Rwanda has certainly come farther in the past 16 years than even the most optimistic observers would have predicted. All of this development is important to recognize because it has been the government’s express policy to deliver basic services and economic growth to its people in order to mitigate genocide ideology.Sixteen years ago, traveling anywhere in the country was bound to be a bumpy ride, if the way was even passable. Today, east-to-west and north-to-south, the road infrastructure is impressive and continues to expand. The country struggled to get tourists in for $ 300 permits to visit Rwanda’s mountain gorillas. Today, during high season, there are not enough $500 tickets to meet the demand. There were no supermarkets or ATMs, and the cheapest cell phones cost at list $60. Today there are multiple supermarkets, over a dozen international ATMs, and cell phones that probably cost $15 are plentiful.Access to electricity and running water, both inconsistent sixteen years ago even for those who could pay for it, is being constantly improved. Rwanda now even have one of the world’s largest methane extractors. Hotels are being built everywhere, it seems, and a real service sector is emerging to meet heightened tourism demand. Wireless broadband is being built out across the country with infrastructure. More restaurants are opening, as are universities, technical schools, and preschools. The second national language has shifted from French to English, and the country has joined the British Commonwealth.Against this impressive backdrop, crushing poverty still affects about 40% of the population. Millions live on tiny plots of land scarcely capable of producing adequate food for families in which the average woman gives birth to six children. It’s this latter issue raging population growth that continues to perplex the policy and development wonks in Rwanda. In response, the government has embarked on an ambitious program to promote family planning, but population momentum takes years to slow.When it comes to political issues women in Rwanda holds more seat in the parliament than any other country. The female majority has ensured that laws aimed raising the status of women are at the forefront of political discourse in Rwanda nowadays. Even when it comes to education it has made it one of the top priorities. 90.6% of the population is even enrolled in Rwanda’s health program. It was reported that Rwanda GDP has grown up to 13% in 1996 through improved tax collection.  In conclusion this nation has shown it can rise from the aftermath of unspeakable violence, and is determined to keep that momentum going and take the next critical steps toward real prosperity.

"My Inspirational Story" <This message was edited>
19/02/24, 3:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Christine, While I get your test evaluated, I have your interview slots, however before I shared the interview slots I would like you and your parents as well to answer a few of my questions.

So I wanted to ask that for the same, so could you and your parent @263775358899 be online for the next 20 minutes to answer my question?
19/02/24, 3:59 pm - +263 77 535 8899: Noted Sir.
19/02/24, 4:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Mrs. Sibuyile, you see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT. <This message was edited>
19/02/24, 4:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
19/02/24, 4:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
19/02/24, 4:02 pm - +263 77 495 7402: <Media omitted>
19/02/24, 4:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263775358899
19/02/24, 4:10 pm - +263 77 495 7402: Noted sir
19/02/24, 4:12 pm - +263 77 535 8899: Yes, I will support her.
19/02/24, 4:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
19/02/24, 4:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below
19/02/24, 4:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/02/24, 4:15 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope now you know Ideally, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th or 27th of February 2024 for $200 and the 26th or 27th of March for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26th or 27th of February 2024

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

22/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 77 535 8899: Good day Sir.
I had gone through the document sent to us.
1. I would like to thank you for all the support and encouragement. I am happy to hear that Christine has been eligible to become one of the Edoofians at a higher percentage of 88%.
2. My understanding is that Christine has been awarded a scholarship with Edoofa.However, I had taken note that this will only be necessitated, If she manage to pay the enrollment  fees before the stated dates.
3.I had also taken note that after upon securing the scholarship letter of intent.Christine will be expected to pay registration fees of close to $500.000USD.
I understood that the 500- 1000 will be adjusted in the 1st semester fees.
My question here is.Who will be paying the registration fees.Will it be paid by Edoofa or Christine herself is supposed to do the payment.
4.I had taken note that Christine had chosen a course which runs for 4 good years.
My question is. Does these 4 years duration  include the internship period.
5.I understand you have said for now noone is away to know what scholarship percentage will be given to Christine.So before the actual scholarship percentage, one should work on an average tution fees of around 2000 - 3000 tution per annum.Have you in past not registered cases where the univesity fees will be too high, that they exceed the above figures.
6.I would also wanted to ask, if the student will not be expected to pay other extra charges like examination  fees after payment of tution fees.
7.I had gone through brounchers for a few universities in India and I had taken note that other fees were charged annually and some were charged per each semester.
My question is. I wanted to know the duration given for payment of tution fees either on each semester or for the annual fees.
8.I also wanted to know who will be responsible for processing of visas and tickets.Will it be self funding or the scholarship will do it for us.

22/02/24, 12:39 pm - +263 77 535 8899: 9.I have understood that the stated figures of 2000-3000 were ment dor tution fees.The figures for accommodation were stand alone figures.I had also taken note that they range from 2000- to around 3000 per annum.

My question is, After being awarded the scholarship, does it mean the same scholar percentage given to tution will alao apply to accommodation.
Sir my fear is. It was not clear to me, if the scholarship will also apply to accommodation. Because the bill should be within range that one would manage to finance the child at school and also allow the family to survive.

So I am looking at costs that are manageable by a single parent.

So I would also wanted to ask how much are the living costs for a single female student. 
10.I have understood that Mr.Charlea Jerera was intrusted that as Zimbabweans we sent our monies through.Are there no other channels that could used in Zimbabwe to make some payments.I am asking this because, I have noted that making payments through his account would also attract costs.So I was looking forward to use a payment system which do not attract other charges.
22/02/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 535 8899: I am going to check whether I had managed to ask questions on most key areas. However I will be able to do this in the evening. Sorry Sir, you are  troubled. The thing is, I should fully understand everything before I commit myself, since I had told you that the family is now single headed. So, I would like to thank you for taking us through the whole process.

23/02/24, 12:14 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Talking about the other mode @263775358899 which is the Direct Bank transfer in our Account, basically because of the cash crisis in Zimbabwe, there are a limited Banks which allow International Transfer. These Banks are Barclays Bank and CBZ Bank, Nedbank and FBC Bank. If you have an account in any of these Banks then the transaction charges will then be $100 to $120 USD for any amount upto $1000 depending upon the bank. Please note that $350 should also be in USD. In case you have Zimbabwean Dollars, you will have to exchange that with USD and transfer charges on *every transaction* would also be $100 to $120.
