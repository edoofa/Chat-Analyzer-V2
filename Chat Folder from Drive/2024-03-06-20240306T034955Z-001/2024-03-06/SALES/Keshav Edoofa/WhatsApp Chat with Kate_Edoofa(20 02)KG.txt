22/02/24, 12:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me help you explain the Edoofa scholarship program!
22/02/24, 12:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
22/02/24, 12:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/02/24, 12:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
22/02/24, 12:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.

22/02/24, 12:37 pm - +263 71 238 8684: Explain the pre test assessment of students
27/02/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263782304800 @263712388684 
How are you, please?
27/02/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 230 4800: I'm good how are you
27/02/24, 1:39 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am doing good Kate
27/02/24, 1:40 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you got some understanding about the Edoofa program?
27/02/24, 1:44 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Yes . I researched a little and I believe I have a better understanding now
27/02/24, 1:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
27/02/24, 1:46 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Yes indeed
27/02/24, 1:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so Kate, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
27/02/24, 1:58 pm - +263 78 230 4800: In the second part regarding the parents' participation are my chances of getting the scholarship low if one of my parents is not present in my life
27/02/24, 2:19 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Then who is the person in this group please?
Your guardian Kate?
27/02/24, 2:36 pm - +263 78 230 4800: That's my mom
I said one of my parents which is my dad who is not a part of my life
27/02/24, 3:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am sorry to hear that Kate
27/02/24, 3:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Its alright Kate, your mother can interact during the session in that case
27/02/24, 8:48 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Okay
28/02/24, 8:20 am - Keshav Edoofa: Good Morning @263782304800 @263712388684

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
28/02/24, 12:23 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Okay so as you're already aware of I'm Kate Kondwelani Chirara aged 19 born on the fifth of January 2005. I did my high schooling at Langham Girls High School where I was the vice Headgirl of 2022 to 2023. I'm currently waiting waiting admission into a university which offers medicine because that's the field I would like to pursue. Descriptively , I would call myself as sophisticated , humble and bubbly person.In my spare time I like to listen to music or sometimes make some of my own and read novels from reputable writers. What I think are my strengths are optimism , self motivation and hard work. Like everyone I have weaknesses which are the fact that I'm too emotional and I overthink almost everything just to name a few. Family wise, I was raised by a single mother in a family of two girls. My mother who takes care of my sister and I works as a teacher in Harare. So that's me in a nutshell.
28/02/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Kate. I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!
28/02/24, 1:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Can you please elaborate a bit about your parents, please?
28/02/24, 4:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
28/02/24, 4:39 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Well my parents are separated so my father did not take the responsibility of caring for he's children, my sister and I. So my whole life I've had only my mother to play the roles of both parents. I tried to reach out to him a couple of times but it was in vain.Hope I've answered your question.
28/02/24, 4:40 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Okay noted 
I was having a bit of a network challenge

29/02/24, 10:17 am - +263 78 230 4800: Well when I joined the scholarship program I was hoping it would be a chance to give her a break or cut some costs while getting quality education. <This message was edited>

29/02/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 230 4800: The field has a lot to learn about that I am very much interested in learning. Studying medicine will not only feed my curious eager mind but it'll we'll give me the opportunity to venture into the practice. I like to put an indelible inprint in people's lives by helping or assisting them. Becoming a medical doctor in my vision is another way to change the world , touch people's lives and put an impact in my society as well
29/02/24, 11:31 am - Keshav Edoofa: Kate, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Medical course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*
29/02/24, 11:33 am - Keshav Edoofa: However Kate you can pursue courses that does not require physics to be mandatory
29/02/24, 11:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: These courses are BSc Cardiovascular Technology, B.Sc. Biology, B.Sc. Medical Laboratory Technology, Physiotherapy and B.Sc. Nursing
29/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 230 4800: I've done some research myself that why I was very much interested since India is very reputable in this area

29/02/24, 12:26 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright then i shall proceed ahead with the course explanation then!

In the following 5 years I'd have established my own surgery in Zimbabwe whilst scouting aspiring youngsters and assisting them as my way of giving back to the community
29/02/24, 5:17 pm - +263 78 230 4800: My apologies
The mobile network that I use has been having challenges this week
02/03/24, 12:31 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263782304800 @263712388684 
I hope you are doing well?
02/03/24, 1:20 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Im good. How are you
02/03/24, 1:20 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am well Kate
02/03/24, 1:21 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is really great Kate I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,
Also I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/03/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 230 4800: It was always my goal to study abroad not in just any country but India to be specific. Like you said India is very reputable in the field of study that I am interested in. Not only does it have the equipment for efficient study but it has flexible educational requirements. In Zimbabwe medicine and engineering are programs that you get if you're a straight A student. Although some who apply without required passes get the programs, chances are very slim .
02/03/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 230 4800: I also feel like I need a totally new environment to put my focus entirely on my studies . Another reason I would like to study abroad is because it will give me a wider net of job opportunities.

05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - +263 78 230 4800: Alright I'm following
05/03/24, 2:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words Kate, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

05/03/24, 3:00 pm - +263 71 238 8684: Certainly
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

05/03/24, 3:00 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
