*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student Bubelihle 

I hope I have contacted the right person?

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot *tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video do go through it properly

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
05/03/24, 5:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
