28/02/24, 3:30 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Good Afternoon Mr. Mike and Tapiwa

*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Tapiwa from Adrian

I hope I have contacted the right person.

Also do note that my working hours are *9:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*. Your active participation would be greatly appreciated.

We shall start your session at 9:30 AM CAT tomorrow!
29/02/24, 9:35 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
29/02/24, 4:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
05/03/24, 5:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
