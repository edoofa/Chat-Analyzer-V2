04/03/24, 10:01 am - +27 64 782 5920: Thanks very much 🙏
04/03/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: I shall brief you about Edoofa scholarship program, please!
04/03/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/03/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/03/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.

04/03/24, 10:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: It is with great pride that i would like to share with you that, recently we hosted a special conference for our Edoofians studying in India,  *SLICE - CON'24 - Symposium of Leaders, Innovators and Creators with Edoofa*, The students embarked on an enlightening industrial visit, immersing themselves in dynamic interactions with our esteemed Founders, CEOs, and visionary entrepreneurs. This is one of the many benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and have a look at the glimpses of this auspicious 3 day event.
04/03/24, 10:06 am - +27 64 782 5920: Thanks
04/03/24, 10:08 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for Thethelela so that just like these students he can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards his higher education by himself and help you as parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/03/24, 10:18 am - +27 64 782 5920: Yes that's correct
04/03/24, 10:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

04/03/24, 12:02 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright so Thethelela, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
04/03/24, 12:03 pm - +27 64 782 5920: I will send to him

04/03/24, 12:19 pm - +263 71 523 5288: I am Thethelela Sonboy Ndebele, currently in Upper Six at Mawabeni High School. My academic pursuits are centered around Biology, Crop Science, and Geography, which captivate my interest and drive for knowledge. As an A-Level student, my strengths lie in my analytical thinking, research skills, and dedication to academic excellence. However, I acknowledge that like many A-Level learners, I face challenges in time management, exam stress, and balancing multiple subjects effectively.

In my leisure time, I find solace and joy in music, particularly the genre of hip hop, which resonates with my creative spirit and love for lyrical expression. Despite the complexities of my family background, where my mother diligently works as a domestic worker in South Africa, and my father's absence following their divorce, I am determined to carve my path to success and realize my aspirations.

As I navigate the challenges of A-Level education, I am committed to harnessing my strengths, overcoming my weaknesses, and pursuing my academic interests with unwavering determination. I strive to embody resilience, perseverance, and a thirst for knowledge as I work towards a future filled with growth, achievement, and fulfillment.
04/03/24, 12:40 pm - +263 71 523 5288: I aspire to become an Agricultural Engineer, a noble goal that involves applying engineering principles to the agricultural sector to enhance productivity, sustainability, and innovation in farming practices. As an Agricultural Engineer, I will play a pivotal role in designing and developing agricultural machinery and systems, optimizing crop production techniques, and addressing environmental challenges in the agricultural industry.

To achieve my ambition of becoming an Agricultural Engineer, it is imperative to follow a relevant academic path by pursuing a degree in Agricultural Engineering or a related field. Moreover, gaining practical experience through internships, research projects, and hands-on training will equip me with valuable insights and skills in agricultural engineering practices.

Furthermore, staying abreast of advancements in agricultural technology, sustainable farming methods, and environmental conservation practices is essential for a successful career as an Agricultural Engineer. Collaborating with industry experts, attending conferences, and engaging in continuous learning opportunities will help broaden my knowledge and expertise in the field.
04/03/24, 2:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Thethelela. I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!
04/03/24, 2:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know who has supported your secondary education till now and who is going to support you financially with your higher education abroad? <This message was edited>
04/03/24, 4:28 pm - +263 71 523 5288: My secondary education has been financially supported by my mother thus far. However, due to our current financial instability and low standard of living, I am uncertain about the source of financial support for my higher education abroad.
04/03/24, 5:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
04/03/24, 5:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 6:03 pm - +263 71 523 5288: I appreciate your intention to share valuable information with me. I look forward to our conversation tomorrow at 9:00 AM CAT and am eager to continue our discussion with a refreshed mindset. Until then, take care, and have a wonderful day ahead. God bless you as well!
04/03/24, 6:12 pm - +263 71 523 5288: I am deeply moved by the motivational content of the video you sent, and it resonates with my aspirations to be a part of Edoofa. The opportunity to interact with CEOs and managers who can impart valuable skills and knowledge is indeed a compelling prospect. However, the realization of this dream hinges on the delicate balance of financial resources between my devoted mother, who works diligently as a domestic worker, and myself.

Given the financial constraints we face, the decision to pursue higher education and participate in programs like Edoofa is a significant one that requires careful consideration and planning. While the prospect of learning from industry leaders is enticing, it is essential to evaluate our financial situation realistically and prudently.

I remain hopeful that with perseverance, determination, and thoughtful financial management, we can navigate the challenges ahead and strive towards achieving our educational and career goals. The path may be challenging, but with dedication and support, I believe that opportunities like those offered by Edoofa can become a reality.
05/03/24, 8:54 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello @263715235288 @27647825920 , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
05/03/24, 8:56 am - Keshav Edoofa: I am so glad you could resonate with our vision, values, and the benefits we are trying to provide to students so they can pursue the highest quality of education abroad at the most affordable cost so that the students can have a very successful career ahead and can be the next world leaders!
05/03/24, 10:19 am - +263 71 523 5288: Yes please
05/03/24, 10:29 am - Keshav Edoofa: May I know your term fee at Mawabeni High School.?
05/03/24, 10:29 am - +263 71 523 5288: My term fee at Mawabeni High School is US$100
05/03/24, 10:36 am - Keshav Edoofa: Duly noted
05/03/24, 10:38 am - Keshav Edoofa: Mrs. Lizzy are you willing to support your child to fullest for his higher education abroad both financially and emotionally? @27647825920
05/03/24, 10:46 am - +27 64 782 5920: Yes lam willing to support my child financially l don't have
05/03/24, 10:49 am - Keshav Edoofa: Can you elaborate that for me please? <This message was edited>
05/03/24, 10:56 am - +27 64 782 5920: Iam earning less than US 300dollers
05/03/24, 11:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
05/03/24, 11:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: We at Edoofa provide scholarship to students and not sponsorships
05/03/24, 11:03 am - Keshav Edoofa: I will explain with to you with an example, Avg cost of education in India is 7-8000$ which is very low in comparison to other countries like US and UK where the cost ranges from 25,000-30000$ , thus after the Edoofa scholarship program that is after the scholarship you receive the fee comes down to 2-3000$ per annum which includes tuition fee , accommodation university expense, and food!
05/03/24, 11:16 am - +27 64 782 5920: I can understand according to me lam also leaving in a foreign country
05/03/24, 11:33 am - +27 64 782 5920: Thanks for your explanation
05/03/24, 12:28 pm - +27 64 782 5920: Living
05/03/24, 1:22 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now as you know the cost after the scholarship if given to Thethelela are you willing to support him?
05/03/24, 1:25 pm - +27 64 782 5920: Yes lam willing
05/03/24, 1:46 pm - +27 64 782 5920: He's going to explain to me.
05/03/24, 2:00 pm - +27 64 782 5920: What's going on
05/03/24, 2:06 pm - +263 71 523 5288: Receiving a scholarship would help me by reducing the cost of his education, making it more affordable for me and you. This support would lessen the financial strain on them and open up opportunities for him to pursue my academic goals with less worry about expenses. Your assistance in this matter could greatly impact my educational path and contribute to my success in reaching my academic aspirations.


Due to our mom low income I don't think I will be able to make it anytime soon.
05/03/24, 2:07 pm - +263 71 523 5288: *Reducing the cost of my education.
05/03/24, 2:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @263715235288 I understand what you are sharing with me
