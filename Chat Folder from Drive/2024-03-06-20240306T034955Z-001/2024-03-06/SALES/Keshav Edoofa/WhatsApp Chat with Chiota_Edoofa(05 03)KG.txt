*I am Mr Keshav, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student Leeroy.

I hope I have contacted the right person?

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot *tomorrow morning at 9:30 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video do go through it properly

05/03/24, 10:15 am - Keshav Edoofa: Hello @263775765591 @263785891011 , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
05/03/24, 5:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
