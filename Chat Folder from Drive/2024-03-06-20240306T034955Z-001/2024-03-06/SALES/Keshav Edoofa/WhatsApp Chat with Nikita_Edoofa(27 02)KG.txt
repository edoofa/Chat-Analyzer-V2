29/02/24, 9:59 am - +260 97 8013636: Edoofa is an organisation that assists students with opportunities to study in India by linking them to schools
29/02/24, 10:01 am - Keshav Edoofa: That is right @260978013636
29/02/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: Let me help you explain the Edoofa scholarship program!
29/02/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/02/24, 10:02 am - Keshav Edoofa: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

29/02/24, 10:05 am - +260 97 8013636: Great
29/02/24, 10:05 am - Keshav Edoofa: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls.

Eoodfa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.
With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.. 

Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia

The Founders of the Edoofa Scholarship Program were invited by the *Ministry of Education of your Country* to appreciate the success of Edoofa Scholarships. 
You are lucky to get this chance based on the Forms filled by you.
29/02/24, 10:06 am - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 10:10 am - Keshav Edoofa: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/02/24, 10:17 am - +260 97 8013636: @260771015527 this is for you
29/02/24, 10:18 am - +260 771015527: Yes it is.
29/02/24, 10:24 am - Keshav Edoofa: Great then!
29/02/24, 10:25 am - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so @260977404993 @260978013636 @260771015527 , as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
29/02/24, 10:26 am - +260 97 7404993: Thanks that is well noted
29/02/24, 10:28 am - +260 771015527: Well noted

29/02/24, 12:13 pm - +260 771015527: Your welcome 🙏
29/02/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I understand your passion for studying a medical course here in India
29/02/24, 1:42 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEET, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
29/02/24, 1:43 pm - Keshav Edoofa: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

*. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*. Bachelors in Optometry*
*. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

Also *BSc Cardiovascular Technology* 
*B.Sc. Biology* and *B.Sc. Nursing*

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students. <This message was edited>

29/02/24, 2:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like to tell you Nikita that public health is only offered at the master's level and not in the undergraduate courses!

The edoofa program will help me achieve my dreams by opening new opportunities and doors for me to learn more and build my career step by step
29/02/24, 2:57 pm - Keshav Edoofa: That is really great @260771015527 I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,
Also I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/02/24, 3:02 pm - +260 771015527: I honestly believe that I’ve got better learning opportunities abroad than in my own country and I would like to gain more academic exposure
29/02/24, 3:03 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I totally resonate with your thoughts @260771015527

29/02/24, 3:15 pm - +260 771015527: All these  are people who studied in India ?
29/02/24, 3:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Nikita absolutely!
29/02/24, 3:16 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
29/02/24, 3:21 pm - +260 771015527: I have no further questions 
You may proceed
29/02/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright in that case then!
29/02/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/02/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/02/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/02/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 3:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/02/24, 3:32 pm - +260 771015527: Well noted
29/02/24, 3:32 pm - +260 97 8013636: Is this across all courses or only business related courses. ?
29/02/24, 3:41 pm - Keshav Edoofa: In simple words @260771015527 @260978013636 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/02/24, 3:43 pm - +260 97 8013636: Great this is very helpful... you are doing good.
29/02/24, 3:47 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am glad you could understand what I intended to share with you so that I can help Nikita and guide her to secure maximum scholarship for her education and do wonders ahead!
29/02/24, 3:48 pm - Keshav Edoofa: So now shall I brief you about the *Earn While You Learn Program.* in detail?
29/02/24, 3:51 pm - +260 771015527: Please go ahead
29/02/24, 3:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in
29/02/24, 3:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

29/02/24, 3:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/02/24, 3:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

29/02/24, 3:51 pm - Keshav Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
29/02/24, 4:02 pm - +260 97 8013636: In my view they would greatly help her... let's wait and hear from Nikita
29/02/24, 4:04 pm - +260 771015527: I believe that it will in the aspect of what I’m expecting when I am done with my education
29/02/24, 4:04 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Nikita
29/02/24, 4:05 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that from both you, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/02/24, 4:07 pm - +260 97 8013636: Great...its a good program.
29/02/24, 4:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/02/24, 4:08 pm - Keshav Edoofa: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
29/02/24, 4:11 pm - +260 771015527: Indeed it is
29/02/24, 4:12 pm - Keshav Edoofa: To summarize this means the more you work hard and do your projects and tasks in EWYL program the more you get paid for it in the form of scholarship credits and reduce your fee as much as you can!
29/02/24, 4:14 pm - +260 771015527: Okay
29/02/24, 4:23 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright Nikita, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
29/02/24, 4:24 pm - +260 771015527: Yes I’m ready
29/02/24, 4:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: @260771015527 @260978013636 @260977404993 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/02/24, 4:26 pm - +260 771015527: $2,250
29/02/24, 4:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Exactly Nikita , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/02/24, 4:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 4:29 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/02/24, 4:32 pm - +260 771015527: So one applying is only meant to pay $350
29/02/24, 4:33 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Yes Nikita you only have to pay 350$ as the enrollment fee and with that Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university zapplications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/02/24, 4:36 pm - +260 771015527: Indeed it is
29/02/24, 4:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/02/24, 4:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
29/02/24, 4:37 pm - Keshav Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/02/24, 4:40 pm - +260 771015527: How long would this procedure take?
29/02/24, 4:44 pm - +260 97 8013636: Is this in addition to the initial $350?
29/02/24, 4:45 pm - Keshav Edoofa: This message was deleted
29/02/24, 4:46 pm - +260 97 8013636: Okay... I thought it's in addition to this.
29/02/24, 4:46 pm - Keshav Edoofa: It is the only amount of 350$ that is the enrollment fee that is to be paid, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option to *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/02/24, 4:49 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood?
29/02/24, 4:50 pm - +260 771015527: Indeed I have understood
29/02/24, 4:50 pm - +260 97 8013636: Yes
29/02/24, 4:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: From your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well @260978013636 @260771015527 , however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
29/02/24, 4:53 pm - +260 771015527: Yes we do understand
29/02/24, 4:53 pm - Keshav Edoofa: As we are in the last phase of counseling session and it is about to end and only one aspect of the program is left to be explained
29/02/24, 4:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I would like you to see this video before that!
29/02/24, 4:54 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 4:58 pm - +260 97 8013636: Great
29/02/24, 5:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and en
roll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
29/02/24, 5:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 5:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Alright @260978013636 @260771015527 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
29/02/24, 5:01 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
29/02/24, 5:04 pm - +260 771015527: Yes I do
29/02/24, 5:05 pm - +260 97 8013636: Will you be able to share with us the universities available and their prospectus.?
29/02/24, 5:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/02/24, 5:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
29/02/24, 5:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
29/02/24, 5:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 5:07 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

- Gulzar Group of Institutions
There are various other universities, as well as the list, goes on and on
29/02/24, 5:09 pm - Keshav Edoofa: I hope now you have understood everything about the Edoofa cycle?
29/02/24, 5:09 pm - +260 771015527: Yes
29/02/24, 5:10 pm - +260 97 8013636: Its for 1 year ?
29/02/24, 5:11 pm - +260 97 8013636: So far so good
29/02/24, 5:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Initial visa is always for one year and subsequently, it gets renewed!
29/02/24, 5:11 pm - +260 97 8013636: Okay
29/02/24, 5:11 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, I want to ask if is there anything you would like me to address?
29/02/24, 5:12 pm - +260 771015527: No not at all
29/02/24, 5:13 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

Can you tell me did you all had a family discussion regarding the program?
04/03/24, 8:54 am - +260 97 7404993: Good morning
04/03/24, 8:55 am - Keshav Edoofa: How are you Mr. Fedrick? <This message was edited>
04/03/24, 8:58 am - +260 97 8013636: Nikita and ourselves had an intense discussion regarding her career path.  Unfortunately as parents we can only advise and the decision is entirely upto her. Nikita still believes that she wants to pursue her career in medicine and she wants to become a doctor. sadly your program doesn't support this course.

04/03/24, 9:22 am - +260 97 8013636: Yes Zambia is one of the countries and we shall try to apply in other countries if possible.
04/03/24, 9:30 am - Keshav Edoofa: I must tell you, Mrs. Gallina every country has its norms, regulations, and strict procedures for studying medicine
Also, it is a long-duration course and in which a master's is necessary to do good ahead!

I must advise you, that studying medicine abroad will be very difficult due to entrance examinations and the very high cost of education
04/03/24, 9:45 am - +260 97 8013636: Very valid point Mr. Keshav.  As parents we have told ourselves not to kill our daughters passion but provide 100%  support. Will wait to receive feedback from the schools that we have applied to
04/03/24, 2:59 pm - Keshav Edoofa: May I know Mrs. Gallina what kind of scholarship programs or schools are willing to provide Nikita a scholarship?
04/03/24, 3:12 pm - +260 97 8013636: We  just started the application process and hoping to start getting feedback in the coming weeks.
04/03/24, 3:24 pm - Keshav Edoofa: See Mrs. Gallina Through the Edoofa program she will be able to pursue medicine after her studies here in India, once she complete a certain course that will open a plethora of opportunities and she can look out for further study options, studying In India will give her the exposure of medical and its entrance examinations too and you all will be able to make an informed decision!
04/03/24, 3:37 pm - +260 97 8013636: Great wonderful 👏.  Let us sit again tonight and revert back to you in the morning with this option

05/03/24, 3:12 pm - +260 771015527: We decided that I would apply to local universities so that I may pursue my passion in health as well as apply for the government scholarship and if I’m not accepted I’ll will try to your program next cohort for the business course
05/03/24, 3:14 pm - +260 97 8013636: What kind of courses would make her eligible to study medicine in India later on?
05/03/24, 3:50 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well @260771015527 I must tell you that if you have researched well the cost of studying in your home country in comparison to India and comparing the quality of education for which India is globally recognized for is so much than India!

And through Edoofa the affordability aspect becomes even less and a plethora of opportunities are opened for you.
05/03/24, 4:21 pm - +260 771015527: Is there any course that I can study with you people that will later on make me eligible to study medicine later on in India ??
05/03/24, 4:44 pm - Keshav Edoofa: Well, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care 

Have a good day ahead.
05/03/24, 4:52 pm - +260 97 8013636: Thank you.  Will be with you tomorrow.  Good night
