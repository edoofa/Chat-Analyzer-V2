Shall I explain the course in depth?
05/03/24, 3:23 pm - +27 72 444 8077: Yes you may explain
05/03/24, 3:24 pm - Kunal: *Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.

It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.

The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.

Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.

They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.
