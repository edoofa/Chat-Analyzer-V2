 We've received your child’s application for the Edoofa scholarship program, and I'll be guiding you through the counselling session to discuss and evaluate the application. Please let me know once you are available!
04/03/24, 8:44 pm - Kunal: Due to the overwhelming response from applicants, we wanted to ensure you receive personalized attention. Therefore, we've scheduled a dedicated time slot just for you:

📅 Date: 5th March 2024 
🕤 Time: 10:00 AM CAT

Please mark this date and time on your calendar to ensure you're available for this important counselling session as your active participation is an important parameter for evaluation. To prepare for our session, we encourage you to explore our website at [www.edoofa.com], the video and document shared along. This will provide you with valuable insights into our programs and opportunities. In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.
