*I'm Mr. Kunal, Career Counselor at Edoofa, and accompanying me is Mr Piyush, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa and Mr. Jyotishman, the Head of Admissions at Edoofa.*

 We've received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program, and I'll be guiding you through the counselling session to discuss and evaluate the application. Please let me know once you are available!
29/02/24, 8:32 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 9:43 pm - +263 77 112 2986: Thank you sir but first I have a concern basing on what i have heard on the session held at Martin Luther king Jr school
29/02/24, 10:00 pm - +263 77 112 2986: At first I need to express my interests and what I expected.
I'm an orphan raised by a single mother who's not formerly employed and I have recently finished my A level studies through a local scholarship and I did very well and managed to obtain 15 points. So I was so desperate of what I can do to have support for my studies that was when I heard about Edoofa least I didn't know that it's not a charity or philanthropic organization so I had to find out that was why I came to Harare. But with what is needed the application fee the enrollment fee up to the visa even though there are those 'earn while you learn' programs, I can safely say that I cannot even afford to be enrolled by Edoofa so I don't know if there's is anything else that I can do or any help I can get or I should just quit?
01/03/24, 9:08 am - +263 77 112 2986: Good morning everyone I'm still waiting to hear from you so that I know what I can do since the time is almost up
01/03/24, 10:06 am - Kunal: Good morning, Ronald
01/03/24, 10:06 am - Kunal: May I know if you are available for a discussion?
01/03/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 112 2986: I am available now only my network might be low though but I am available
01/03/24, 11:45 am - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for a Board Meeting. Let us connect at *12:50 pm CAT* for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

01/03/24, 11:47 am - +263 77 112 2986: No problem with that I will be in touch
01/03/24, 1:02 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon
Shall we proceed?
01/03/24, 1:04 pm - +263 77 112 2986: Yes we can proceed only my mom isn't available at the moment but I think it won't be a problem because I will let her know
01/03/24, 1:10 pm - +263 77 112 2906: Thank you sir I'm now available I was a bit busy sorry for any inconveniences caused
01/03/24, 1:18 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
How are you doing?
01/03/24, 1:19 pm - +263 77 112 2986: We are doing well
01/03/24, 1:35 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
01/03/24, 1:36 pm - Kunal: Can you tell me as per your understanding what is the cost of education?
01/03/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 112 2986: I could come to understand that but from what I have heard it's actually rounding up to $2000 but that being the case I could not even afford any local university or international so that's why I was looking for scholarships
01/03/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 112 2906: Education is the foundation of life nothing you can do  without  education
01/03/24, 2:03 pm - +263 77 112 2986: We can agree to that but now what's needed and with what I have they can't go hand in hand because even for my early education years I was helped by some local scholarships and now I'm still in need of it so when I heard of Edoofa I thought  I found the solution but now what's the way forward
01/03/24, 2:27 pm - Kunal: I understand
So, may I know how are you planning to proceed for your education?
01/03/24, 3:12 pm - +263 77 112 2986: Im looking for a scholarship which I think can help me out so if it's all it takes I will see but for now I can say I can't even afford the enrollment and the application fees despite other costs
01/03/24, 3:58 pm - Kunal: I understand
After the event, did you discuss the same with any one from the team at the event?
01/03/24, 4:16 pm - +263 77 112 2986: I didn't because I was already late and I was supposed to travel all to he way back home and my mother was  concerned about my safety so I decided to leave since it was already 5.00 pm
01/03/24, 4:21 pm - Kunal: I understand, Ronald
May I know if you traveled from Mashonaland East?
01/03/24, 4:41 pm - +263 77 112 2986: No I traveled from Manicaland and that's where I am staying right now
01/03/24, 4:48 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
02/03/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 112 2906: OK thank you
02/03/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 112 2906: Every body is expecting high education but due to sauce of income is the major challenge to me
02/03/24, 10:29 am - +263 77 112 2906: I do understand what we are putting into consideration and where you are coming from but as a parent I want to do what is the best for my child the challenge now is the resources available.From what my Child was saying about you it is clear that you might help and I appreciate that so now what's the way forward so that we may stop wasting resources and time. What can we expect from you since 100% scholarship is hard to get
02/03/24, 11:12 am - Kunal: Good morning to you all

02/03/24, 5:11 pm - +263 77 112 2906: We are fine

04/03/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
04/03/24, 12:05 pm - Kunal: I understand the same, Mrs Mtisi

As you're aware, the Edoofa Scholarship Program provides scholarships ranging from 50% to 100% on tuition fees. However, there are additional costs for living expenses and transportation that must be covered by the student's family. If you are deemed eligible for the program, are you able to manage these remaining expenses?
