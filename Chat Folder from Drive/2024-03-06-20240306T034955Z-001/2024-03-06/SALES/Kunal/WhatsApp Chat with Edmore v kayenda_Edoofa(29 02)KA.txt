*I'm Mr. Kunal, Career Counselor at Edoofa, and accompanying me is Mr Piyush, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa and Mr. Jyotishman, the Head of Admissions at Edoofa.*

 We've received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program, and I'll be guiding you through the counselling session to discuss and evaluate the application. Please let me know once you are available!

29/02/24, 2:11 pm - Kunal: It is fine, thank you
29/02/24, 2:11 pm - Kunal: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.


*So, I am making you the group admin, please add your parents/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done.*
