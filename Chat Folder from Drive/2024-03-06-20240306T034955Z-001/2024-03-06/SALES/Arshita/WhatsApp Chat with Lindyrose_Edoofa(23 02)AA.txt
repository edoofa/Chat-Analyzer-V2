23/02/24, 10:19 am - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
23/02/24, 10:20 am - +263 78 105 3406: Yesss am aiming for higher points mam
23/02/24, 10:21 am - Arshita: Amazing!
23/02/24, 10:21 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
23/02/24, 10:23 am - +263 78 105 3406: I researched on the advantages on foreign education  and one that i loved the most is that of  it helps to link a person to other Foreign countries and the certificates attained are mostly desired and highly valued in Foreign Countries thereby making high chances of a person getting an occupation in foreign countries
23/02/24, 10:24 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

23/02/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 105 3406: Those are excellent facts concerning India.Thank you for that mam
23/02/24, 11:06 am - Arshita: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?

23/02/24, 11:12 am - Arshita: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
23/02/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 105 3406: No am not mam
23/02/24, 11:15 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/02/24, 11:15 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 11:15 am - Arshita: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
23/02/24, 11:22 am - +263 78 105 3406: It can be affordable
23/02/24, 11:23 am - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
23/02/24, 11:25 am - +263 78 105 3406: Noo explain that to me mam please
23/02/24, 11:26 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
23/02/24, 11:26 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

23/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 78 105 3406: Indeed it lessons the financial burden.Am looking forward  to that as well
23/02/24, 11:39 am - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
23/02/24, 11:42 am - +263 78 105 3406: Fact number 4
23/02/24, 11:44 am - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

23/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 78 105 3406: Woww  great earnings indeed mam
23/02/24, 11:49 am - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
23/02/24, 11:52 am - +263 78 105 3406: My parents and my  other  close relatives who desire me tu pursue my dreams are willing to help me
23/02/24, 11:52 am - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
23/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 105 3406: My family feels its a great thing for me to study abroad as it will unlock several doors and opportunities of working in foreign countries since the   education offered is of high quality.They also believe its good as it will uplift the family name as i will be the first child in the family to have studied abroad.Hence they are happy and proud enough about me studying abroad
23/02/24, 11:59 am - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
23/02/24, 11:59 am - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
23/02/24, 12:04 pm - +263 78 105 3406: I think , a financial information tooo such as the family's income and asserts
23/02/24, 12:05 pm - Arshita: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
23/02/24, 12:05 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 12:12 pm - +263 78 105 3406: You may if am wrong but i believe its paid after a student has qualified after the eligibility check and its paid for the Statement of purpose as these are to be drafted proffessionally.Thats what i think mam
23/02/24, 12:13 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
23/02/24, 12:13 pm - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
23/02/24, 12:16 pm - +263 78 105 3406: Well read and understood mam
23/02/24, 12:17 pm - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
23/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 78 105 3406: Well read and understood mam
23/02/24, 12:21 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 12:28 pm - +263 78 105 3406: We have dicussed till stage 6
23/02/24, 12:29 pm - Arshita: We have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
23/02/24, 12:29 pm - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
23/02/24, 12:29 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
23/02/24, 12:29 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
23/02/24, 12:32 pm - +263 78 105 3406: Indeed mam everything is now vividly clear
24/02/24, 8:51 am - Arshita: Greetings @263773665449 and @263781053406 

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
24/02/24, 11:34 am - +263 78 105 3406: Yesssss mam
24/02/24, 11:35 am - Arshita: It is good to connect with you today, Lindyrose
I hope you are doing well

Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
24/02/24, 11:35 am - +263 78 105 3406: Yess i did
24/02/24, 12:03 pm - Arshita: So may I know what discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
24/02/24, 12:20 pm - +263 78 105 3406: We talked about the quality education being offered by the edoofa scholarship programm and the advantages of attaining  the edoofa certificate.Which they also saw it as bennefitting to us.I further  went on tu explain to them the EWYLP which  is  good as it helps to reduce the financial   burden  , which they alsooo saw  as benefitting  and as an added advantage. We further discussed on the reduced fee of the edoofa programme ,of which they said it is good and quite helpful as it reduced the financial crisis faced by most families and due to the weak economy the country is facing currently. We further discussed on how the edoofa agents will continue  to guide me throughout till i reach india , which they feel is quite secure and trustable
24/02/24, 12:21 pm - Arshita: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! So may I know if your family has any questions for me?
24/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 105 3406: They wanted to inquire about the flight ticket to india.Do they have to save up  money for it or its covered in the fees that i wll be paying while am still in Zimbabwe
24/02/24, 12:26 pm - Arshita: Yes, you will have to manage it.
24/02/24, 12:27 pm - +263 78 105 3406: How much is that mam
24/02/24, 12:28 pm - Arshita: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
24/02/24, 12:30 pm - +263 78 105 3406: oky mam i understand perfectly
24/02/24, 12:30 pm - Arshita: Do you have any other questions?
24/02/24, 12:32 pm - +263 78 105 3406: What about religion, are there pentecostal denominations in india
24/02/24, 12:33 pm - Arshita: Yes, there are Pentecostal denominations in India. Pentecostalism has spread to various parts of the world, including India, where it has gained followers and established churches and organizations. While it may not be as widespread as in some other countries, there are certainly Pentecostal churches and believers throughout India.
24/02/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 105 3406: Oky mam, my questions end here
24/02/24, 12:35 pm - Arshita: May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
24/02/24, 12:42 pm - +263 78 105 3406: My parents said they may not afford to pay the 3000 but they assured me that they will try by all means to raise the money through starting poultry projects and my sisters said they  will increase their poultry projects  so as to gain more income.They went on to say that the amount of the enrollment fee is  okay compared to  the fees charged here in Zimbabwe universities.So they believe they will raise the money as they want me to pursue my career as the last born at home
24/02/24, 12:45 pm - Arshita: I can understand that!
24/02/24, 12:45 pm - Arshita: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

Since the results were shared over email, you are supposed to acknowledge them as well.

For your convenience, let me share the Letter of Acceptance for Ruramai over here as well so that you can go through it and let me know
01/03/24, 12:35 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
01/03/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 486 4649: Thank you very much.Yhis is pleasing news
01/03/24, 1:43 pm - +263 78 105 3406: Thank you soo mch
01/03/24, 2:01 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through the letter?
01/03/24, 2:05 pm - +263 78 486 4649: Yes we have
01/03/24, 2:06 pm - Arshita: Do you have any questions?
01/03/24, 2:37 pm - +263 78 486 4649: Can we get a rough estimate on how much the tuition may be
01/03/24, 2:42 pm - Arshita: Average will be $2000-$3000
01/03/24, 2:48 pm - +263 78 486 4649: Ok alrigh.   So her eligibility score has reduced that by at least 60%
01/03/24, 2:58 pm - Arshita: Edoofa is not an Agent wherein we are only associated with 1 University. If that would have been the case I would have told you the exact fees during the counseling session itself, the reason I shared the annual fees in a range is that Edoofa is associated with 250+ UGC-recognized universities and that is why we are able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their *Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well*, and  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/03/24, 2:58 pm - Arshita: Now what you have is a very common question that any family member of the student has is why aren't they told of a fixed annual fee beforehand so that they could plan for the cost properly. I am sure similar might have been your concern as well, which is why I would again like to bring it to your knowledge that Edoofa is not an Agent that is only associated with 1 University. 

Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well.
01/03/24, 2:58 pm - Arshita: Now it is obvious that every university would evaluate a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the Quantum of scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student gets to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.
01/03/24, 2:59 pm - Arshita: As you can see it is clearly mentioned that as per Lindyrose's eligibility check evaluation her annual fee will be within the range of $1200 to $1800 inclusive of all the above mentioned aspect for the entire year.
01/03/24, 3:14 pm - +263 78 486 4649: Ok thank you very much its all clear
01/03/24, 3:14 pm - Arshita: Are you clear with the modes of payment?
01/03/24, 3:28 pm - +263 78 486 4649: Yes they are  clear
01/03/24, 3:31 pm - Arshita: Which one will you be following?
01/03/24, 3:32 pm - +263 78 486 4649: We are yet to decide
01/03/24, 3:32 pm - Arshita: Let me know once you decide
01/03/24, 3:32 pm - Arshita: So that I can elaborate more on that
01/03/24, 3:34 pm - +263 78 486 4649: Ok we will
03/03/24, 8:36 pm - Arshita: Let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion at Let us connect at *10:00 am CAT Tomorrow* to resume your session 

Meanwhile, you can go through this video to learn more about the experience of Edoofians.
