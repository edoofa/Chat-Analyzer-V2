05/03/24, 10:48 am - Arshita: Greetings!
05/03/24, 10:49 am - Arshita: Dear Parent and Student, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University
05/03/24, 10:49 am - Arshita: Okay so Farai, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 11:04 am - +263 77 769 4991: Greetings ma'am 
Yes I do
05/03/24, 11:07 am - Arshita: Alright so Farai, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
05/03/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 769 4991: Thank you for giving me this opportunity. My name is Farai Nzara. I completed my Ordinary Level at Makwau Secondary School, passing with eleven subjects and achieving three straight As in my Advanced Level studies at Jameson Hugh School. I pursued Pure Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry and attained 15 points in 2024. Due to my success in these areas, I am keen on studying Civil and Water Engineering, a field I have been passionate about since my secondary school years. The captivating images of buildings and structures in newspapers have always inspired me with the innovative ideas behind their construction.

My strengths lie in being a hardworking, self-motivated, collaborative, and honest student. However, I acknowledge that I have a fear of public speaking. Nevertheless, I am eager to overcome this weakness through my studies to become proficient in this skill. My hobbies include reading, researching, and playing javelin and basketball. I am the fifth child in a family of seven children. My parents are hardworking and dedicated to seeing their children achieve their best. My father is a teacher at a local school, while my mother is a homemaker.
05/03/24, 11:47 am - Arshita: So, could you kindly tell me how much *Jameson Hugh School* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
05/03/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 769 4991: It charges US $150 per term .My father was supporting me financially in my studies and he is a teacher at a local school in Zimbabwe
05/03/24, 11:50 am - Arshita: Meanwhile as we proceed ahead, I had a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Civil Engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
05/03/24, 12:03 pm - +263 77 769 4991: I have been fascinated by the intricacies of the infrastructure and construction. I have always been motivated by how civil engineers play a pivotal role in shaping the world we live today.Growing up in a rural area, where we lived in clay huts and got water from wells, was normal for me. But when I visited Harare, the capital city of Zimbabwe, everything changed. Seeing tall buildings and having water come out of taps felt like magic. It was so different from the simple life in the countryside, and it made me really want to help modernize my home in Masvingo.

Seeing how things we needed every day could change into modern comforts really stuck with me. It felt like I found a world of exciting opportunities, and that's when I knew I wanted to study civil engineering. I hope that one day, with what I learn from studying civil engineering, I can bring that same feeling of progress and wonder to my rural community in Masvingo.
05/03/24, 12:11 pm - Arshita: Alright so now can you share your O Level and A level results for evaluation?
05/03/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 769 4991: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 12:14 pm - +263 77 769 4991: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 12:39 pm - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 01:45 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

05/03/24, 12:42 pm - +263 77 380 7303: That's fine Arshita
05/03/24, 2:04 pm - Arshita: Thank you for waiting. 

Are we good to continue?
05/03/24, 2:06 pm - +263 77 769 4991: Yes we can continue
05/03/24, 2:13 pm - Arshita: Based on your previous results and evaluation of ESAT percentile, accessing your strengths and weaknesses I foresee you doing a Degree in engineering .So now shall I brief you about *BACHELOR OF TECHNOLOGY IN CIVIL ENGINEERING*?
05/03/24, 2:14 pm - +263 77 769 4991: Yes, go ahead ma'am
05/03/24, 2:15 pm - Arshita: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
05/03/24, 2:23 pm - +263 77 769 4991: Thank you for the broadway insight about the field
05/03/24, 2:26 pm - Arshita: Did you understand the course?
05/03/24, 2:27 pm - +263 77 769 4991: Yes understood
05/03/24, 2:28 pm - Arshita: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 2:35 pm - +263 77 769 4991: Okay 
I'm not aware
05/03/24, 2:36 pm - Arshita: In simple words Farai what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 2:40 pm - +263 77 769 4991: So how much can I make through Earn While You Learn Programe
05/03/24, 2:42 pm - Arshita: So now would you like to ask anything?
05/03/24, 2:43 pm - +263 77 380 7303: @918595947401 please share more details about the Earn while You Learn Program
05/03/24, 2:46 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/03/24, 2:46 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market.
