01/03/24, 2:39 pm - +263 77 228 4241: Ok
My name is Zvaita Patricia Vimbai.I'm 44 years.I'm married  to Mubvakure James.Iam a mother of 4.I reside in Harare in the Northern  province of Zimbabwe.
My highest  education qualifications Part A CIS (Institute  of Chartered Secretaries in Zimbabwe).I failed to complete this course due to financial constraints. 
I'm employed at Silo Food Industries as an Accounts Clerk.Im serving my 20th year within this company. 
What motivates me more to support my child in his educational journey is his dream.
When he was in his junior school his dream was to become an astronaut.Children around him could not understand this dream so they ended up making him a laughing  stock.I was ever by his side telling him to focus and pursue his dream even if it means that he has to walk his journey of life without friends  up until he finds those who believe in him.
Gracious later upgraded his dream to become an engineer (Aerospace)
In Zimbabwe his dream is not popular but I believe in my son that he will come out as a shinning star in future.
01/03/24, 2:55 pm - Arshita: Good to know more about you. You expressed yourself genuinely. 

It is good to see that you are from Harare
01/03/24, 2:55 pm - Arshita: Harare is very close to us as our founders hosted Education summits last year as well as this year.

02/03/24, 1:16 pm - Arshita: Noted
02/03/24, 1:16 pm - Arshita: Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
02/03/24, 1:29 pm - +263 77 228 4241: I have so much trust that Gracious is confident in achieving best results.
02/03/24, 1:32 pm - +263 77 228 4241: Iam entering an offline zone.i don't know if there is some important communication that I might miss.
03/03/24, 8:32 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 7:59 am - +263 77 228 4241: Good morning madam Arshita.Hope you had a wonderful weekend.

*"The secret of getting ahead is getting started." - Mark Twain*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
04/03/24, 10:20 am - +263 77 228 4241: Yes
04/03/24, 10:35 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
04/03/24, 11:49 am - +263 77 228 4241: As of now ,this is the only platform that I have applied for foreign education.
04/03/24, 11:59 am - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
04/03/24, 11:59 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 11:59 am - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
04/03/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 228 4241: Ok.will do so
04/03/24, 12:45 pm - +263 77 228 4241: I liked page 4:2
How best can you tell that the course one takes is employable?in our African mindset we are more concerned  about getting a seat at the university .
04/03/24, 12:46 pm - Arshita: I will be guiding you about everything !
04/03/24, 12:47 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you
Looking at your interests and passion towards aerosplanes and aeronauticals,let me share with you that we do offer Aerospace Engineering but as your counsellor I would like to highlight a few parameters

-This is a niche course which has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low

- If you opt for this branch ,your scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself.At the same time if you opt a degree like Mechanical Engineering ,it can help to bridge you to Aeronautical,Aerospace,Automotive etc at the same time helps to fulfull your interests to solve challenges,to bring innovations and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as mother of Engineering!
04/03/24, 12:55 pm - +263 77 228 4241: You said it well.
Thank you.
So with this information, I need to guide the child on Aerospace  engineering. 
As you have said it,I think it will be wise for the child to do Mechanical engineering.
04/03/24, 1:00 pm - Arshita: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
04/03/24, 1:25 pm - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 02:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

05/03/24, 9:44 am - Arshita: Greetings!

*"If you can dream it, you can do it."*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
05/03/24, 9:50 am - +263 77 228 4241: Yes
05/03/24, 9:50 am - Arshita: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
05/03/24, 10:02 am - +263 77 228 4241: First and foremost,I liked the idea that one can earn q salary whilst learning.
2.big names of successful people got their education in India.
3.the course that my child likes,I believe that there is enough room for him to do his researches.
05/03/24, 10:03 am - Arshita: *By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
05/03/24, 10:50 am - +263 77 228 4241: I have no idea but I know it's costly
05/03/24, 10:53 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/03/24, 10:53 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 11:15 am - +263 77 228 4241: For sure with India one can afford abroad education.
05/03/24, 11:15 am - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
05/03/24, 11:22 am - +263 77 228 4241: How is it done?
May you please enlighten  me
05/03/24, 11:23 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
