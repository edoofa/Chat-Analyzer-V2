23/02/24, 12:21 pm - +27 74 826 9867: I understand
23/02/24, 12:21 pm - Arshita: I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you will be intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and help you achieve your goals?
23/02/24, 12:35 pm - +27 74 826 9867: Studying in India have a positive impact on my career because of  global recognition a Indian degrees are highly recognised so its possible for the opportunity of various job and also it boost ones confidence in the future in case of being a leader.Studying in India helps me achieve my goals because ıt's  affordable and the cost of education is lower and financial assistance programs are available to support students.Also, students learn how to interact with people from the other countries which helps one in the future
23/02/24, 12:35 pm - Arshita: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
23/02/24, 12:35 pm - +27 74 826 9867: No
23/02/24, 12:36 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/02/24, 12:37 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 12:37 pm - Arshita: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost $3000 or less a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

*So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
23/02/24, 12:38 pm - +27 74 826 9867: Yes
23/02/24, 12:39 pm - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
23/02/24, 12:39 pm - +27 74 826 9867: So if a student performs well they help him or her once again
23/02/24, 12:39 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
23/02/24, 12:40 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

23/02/24, 12:45 pm - +27 74 826 9867: Yes
23/02/24, 12:46 pm - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
23/02/24, 12:49 pm - +27 74 826 9867: 1.Career selection 
2.Visa
3.Fee payment 
4.Travel guidance
23/02/24, 12:49 pm - Arshita: This message was deleted
23/02/24, 12:50 pm - Arshita: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
23/02/24, 12:50 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
23/02/24, 12:51 pm - +27 74 826 9867: Yes
23/02/24, 12:52 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
23/02/24, 12:52 pm - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
23/02/24, 12:53 pm - +27 74 826 9867: Okay
23/02/24, 12:54 pm - +27 74 826 9867: So how does one know that she qualifies
23/02/24, 12:54 pm - Arshita: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
23/02/24, 12:54 pm - Arshita: Results will be put after final interview
23/02/24, 12:55 pm - +27 74 826 9867: Okay
23/02/24, 12:55 pm - +27 74 826 9867: Okay
23/02/24, 12:56 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
23/02/24, 1:00 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
23/02/24, 1:00 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.

04/03/24, 12:45 pm - +27 84 695 5170: At Edoofa scholarship
04/03/24, 12:45 pm - Arshita: Absolutely ! <This message was edited>
04/03/24, 12:46 pm - Arshita: Are you clear with the modes of payment ? <This message was edited>
04/03/24, 1:02 pm - +27 84 695 5170: Can you explain in detail especially after l am in India how much per semester
04/03/24, 1:06 pm - Arshita: There are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe
04/03/24, 1:07 pm - +27 84 695 5170: Okay
04/03/24, 1:07 pm - +27 84 695 5170: How much per semester
04/03/24, 1:08 pm - Arshita: The reduced fee is $2000 which will be paid in two equal installments, well this cost can be reduced by the help of EWYL program and as you see that there is no limit as to the amount of scholarship credits that one can earn .

All as per the current scenario if Progress passes the interview well , I might be able to suggest the application for a higher quantum of scholarship by which the fee will reduce further to $1200-$1800 for a year again reducing the cost almost to half. <This message was edited>
04/03/24, 1:11 pm - +27 84 695 5170: $1200 us dollars
04/03/24, 1:12 pm - Arshita: Yes
04/03/24, 1:13 pm - Arshita: So you are eligible for that!
04/03/24, 1:25 pm - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 02:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

04/03/24, 2:45 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
04/03/24, 2:45 pm - Arshita: His account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333038014048828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

04/03/24, 2:46 pm - Arshita: For your reference, I have shared a few recently completed fee receipts, once you complete the formality using this mode you would receive a similar receipt please.
04/03/24, 2:47 pm - +27 84 695 5170: What do you mean by transfer charges
04/03/24, 2:49 pm - Arshita: The conversion charges
04/03/24, 2:54 pm - +27 84 695 5170: On top of enrollment and registration fee l need to also pay those charges
04/03/24, 3:10 pm - Arshita: Yes Shannah, basically talking about the first mode, which is the Direct Bank transfer in our Account, basically because of the cash crisis in Zimbabwe, there are a limited Banks which allow International Transfer. These Banks are Barclays Bank and CBZ Bank, Nedbank and FBC Bank. If you have an account in any of these Banks then the transaction charges will then be $100 to $120 USD for any amount upto $1000 depending upon the bank. Please note that $350 should also be in USD. In case you have Zimbabwean Dollars, you will have to exchange that with USD and transfer charges on *every transaction* would also be $100 to $120.

Now the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.
04/03/24, 3:12 pm - +27 84 695 5170: So how much are the payments my payments altogether
04/03/24, 3:13 pm - Arshita: The first is the enrollment fee which is $350
04/03/24, 3:13 pm - Arshita: You can pay in two installments
04/03/24, 3:13 pm - +27 84 695 5170: I know
04/03/24, 3:13 pm - +27 84 695 5170: $350 plus what
04/03/24, 3:14 pm - Arshita: $200 by 8th March 
$150 by 8th April <This message was edited>
