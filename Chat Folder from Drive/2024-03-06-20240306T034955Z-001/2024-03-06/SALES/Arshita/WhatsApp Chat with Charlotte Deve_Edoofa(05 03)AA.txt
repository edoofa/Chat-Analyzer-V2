I'm a girl aged 17 now doing my U6 at Nyachuru High School in Mashonaland Central Province. I would like to study Business Management because I want to be a business woman. My mom is a house wife and she is not employed and my dad is not employed as well and he does piece jobs. My parent's highest leve of education is O Level. I have two sisters. My elder sister is in the university and my little sister is in form 1. My dad has been financially supporting me so far. Since my dad is not employed, it is not possible for him to support me for my higher education abroad. My per term fee in school is $100. My family is my strength and my weakness as well. I love my family so much. I want to change my family background. I love drawing, writing stories and dancing as my hobbies.
