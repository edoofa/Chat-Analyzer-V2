04/03/24, 11:09 am - Arshita: Okay so Rejoice, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/03/24, 11:11 am - +263 78 852 3448: Yes ma'am
04/03/24, 11:12 am - Arshita: Alright so Rejoice, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
04/03/24, 11:13 am - +263 78 852 3448: Sure ma'am let me share
04/03/24, 11:20 am - +263 78 852 3448: I am a goal oriented girl aged 18 , l come from a family of six and l am the last born. 
I finished my A'level last year and l wish to further upgrade my studies. I want to pursue Business Administration. 

For my strengths, I can say l am charismatic and I have resilience. I am good with teamwork and I am sociable. 

For my weaknesses, l  can say I am someone who is too emotional. 

I love writing and listening to music during my spare time.
04/03/24, 11:24 am - +263 78 852 3448: I lost my mother when l was 10years and have been living with my father since then. 
My father is unemployed, and he does part-time jobs here and there. 

 My siblings live in South Africa where they work to get income that supports our family. 

My sister works as a teacher in a pre-school in South Africa and my older brother works at Nandos.
04/03/24, 11:27 am - Arshita: I am so sorry to hear about your mother! You are truly a strong girl!
04/03/24, 11:27 am - +263 78 852 3448: Thank you ma'am
04/03/24, 11:28 am - Arshita: So Rejoice, could you kindly tell me the name of the school and how much school charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
04/03/24, 11:32 am - +263 78 852 3448: I learnt at Emakhandeni High School. The school charges $80 every term. 

When l had finished my grade 7, proceeding to secondary, l passed and I got a donor. 

The Emakhandeni Council was the one supporting me with school fees from form 1 upto last year when l finished my form 6

In my family, my brother and sister support me financially, and they are the ones who cater for my financial needs. 

My sister is the one who works as a pre-school teacher and my brother works as a cook at a restaurant in South Africa.
04/03/24, 12:00 pm - Arshita: Good to know about you and your siblings
04/03/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Sure ma'am
04/03/24, 12:01 pm - Arshita: Meanwhile as we proceed ahead, I had a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Business, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
04/03/24, 12:04 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Its because nowadays looking at the current situation in the country, having a job as a source of income is no longer that much sustainable. 

Hence if l study Business , l can be able to start my own business that will generate more income and be able to sustain itself and my family as well. 

Another reason is that l was always fond of business studies while learning at school.
04/03/24, 3:28 pm - Arshita: Alright so now can you share your O Level and A level results for evaluation?
04/03/24, 3:28 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Sure ma'am

04/03/24, 3:41 pm - Arshita: Did you understand the course?
04/03/24, 3:44 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Yes ma'am
04/03/24, 3:44 pm - Arshita: That's a wonderful course that you have settled for, I also have access to the Feedback form that you filled out after the session with your parents and I hope you are aware, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/03/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Yes l am aware ma'am
04/03/24, 3:46 pm - Arshita: In simple words Rejoice what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/03/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 852 3448: That's good ma'am , especially about the,  earn while you learn program.
04/03/24, 3:49 pm - Arshita: However as per my experience, since you have a valid ESAT Score with decent High School Results, as per your interaction with the Board of Directors at Edoofa you surely will be rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for you could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *After this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/03/24, 3:50 pm - +263 78 852 3448: I understand ma'am
04/03/24, 3:50 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Thank you so much
04/03/24, 3:51 pm - Arshita: So now would you like to ask anything?
04/03/24, 3:52 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Yes ma'am
04/03/24, 3:53 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Wanted to ask that , despite the fees that would be reduced , 

Do I still have to pay the $350 and the one for visa processing and all
04/03/24, 3:53 pm - Arshita: I hope it was quite evident during the Videos played during the presentations that you attended the students working on the Internships and Attachments of the much coveted EArn While You Learn Program manage to earn USD 50- USD 100 Each however since there is no limit to earning students like Persistence Muza were able to also self finance the Cost of Education though students like these are less but I am sure you are highly motivated!
04/03/24, 3:53 pm - Arshita: Let me guide you further about that
04/03/24, 3:54 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Sure
04/03/24, 3:55 pm - Arshita: Alright Rejoice, I hope you also remember Dr. Gupta discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members were available even if they were not you discussed the same with them so will they be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
04/03/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Yes, they are the ones that will support me

04/03/24, 4:02 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Yes ma'am
04/03/24, 4:03 pm - Arshita: However Rejoice, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $100 within the next 30 days.*
04/03/24, 4:04 pm - +263 78 852 3448: This is quite flexible and better

Yes I am
04/03/24, 4:06 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 4:09 pm - +263 78 852 3448: I understand
04/03/24, 4:10 pm - Arshita: Alright Rejoice, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
04/03/24, 4:10 pm - Arshita: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/03/24, 4:12 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Yes I understand now

The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
04/03/24, 4:13 pm - Arshita: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
04/03/24, 4:14 pm - +263 78 852 3448: I understand ma'am
04/03/24, 4:19 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 4:21 pm - +263 78 852 3448: Woow
