04/03/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 499 2001: *Personal Statement*

In the depths of my being, I am driven by a profound life purpose - to be a beacon of hope and change in my community. Witnessing the struggles of the sick, hungry, and underprivileged ignites a fire within me, compelling me to make a tangible difference in their lives. The mere sight of a smile on a poor child's face resonates deeply with my soul, fueling my unwavering commitment to uplift those in need and bring about positive transformation.

Empathy courses through my veins, propelling me towards a future where I can contribute to making the world a better place for all. Guided by the values instilled in me by my parents, I navigate life with humility, resilience, and an unyielding moral compass.

In the tapestry of my personality, I am defined by a love for challenges, a passion for intellectual pursuits, and a deep-rooted desire to assist those in need. Story writing, Poetry,Chess, Checkers, keep me occupied during my leisure time.

*Family Background*

Growing up in a financially challenging background, Chitungwiza, a peri-urban settlement, my family has faced constant struggles. My father works as a vendor, tirelessly selling various items to make ends meet, while my mother dedicates herself to managing the household. Their combined efforts have provided for our basic needs with my two siblings ,one in grade 7 and the other who is 2yrs old. Still, the income generated from these grueling endeavors is wildly inconsistent, leaving us in perpetual uncertainty and despair.
As the eldest child,I have witnessed my parents' immense sacrifices as they prioritize our well-being over their own. They have ensured that my two siblings and I have food and a roof over our heads. However, we often find ourselves trapped in a cycle of deprivation, struggling to afford even the most essential items required for survival. Our lives have been marred by extreme hardship, forcing us to make heart-wrenching choices daily. The unbearable reality of our situation frequently compels us to prioritize bare necessities over educational expenses, leaving my dreams of a better future hanging by a thread.
04/03/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 499 2001: 1)U6 ( A level graduate)
*Subject combination*
Pure mathematics
Chemistry
Physics
Biology

2) Medicine and Surgery
*Why?* 
During my time in high school, we visited the Bumhudzo Old People's Home where I met our old citizens who needed much attention as far as healthcare is concerned, many of them expressed the need to get medical attention but they had no resources to access the healthcare. My passion to become a medical health practitioner was necessitated by that experience. 
The pursuit of medicine and surgery is not merely a personal ambition for me; it is a patriotic duty. I am acutely aware of the pressing need for skilled and compassionate healthcare professionals who can uplift and transform the lives of those who have been neglected and marginalized. I refuse to stand idly by as my community suffers, and l am determined to be the catalyst for transformation
With each passing day, new challenges emerge, demanding our collective strength and resilience. From the shadows of past pandemics to the looming threats of tomorrow, I stand ready to stand by my community, my society, and my nation, offering a beacon of hope and healing in times of uncertainty. It is in these moments of service and sacrifice that I find my true purpose and ultimate fulfillment.
