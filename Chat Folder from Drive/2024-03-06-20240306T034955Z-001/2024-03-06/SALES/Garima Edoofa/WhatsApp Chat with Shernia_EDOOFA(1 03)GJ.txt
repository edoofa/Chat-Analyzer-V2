I come from a polygamous family,my father having two wives with ten children and I am the second born.My parents are subsistence farmers they only grow food for consumption without any other for selling for cash due to some reasons.My mother have a heart problem so she spents most of her time at home.The  highest level of education for my father was form 4 and my mom was form 2 .I have 6 biological siblings and 3 who are non-biological
04/03/24, 10:58 am - Garima Edoofa: It is a pleasure to know about you and your family, @263781618160
04/03/24, 10:58 am - +263 78 161 8160: Oh sorry I have forgotten to enter my parents' names,my father is Ocean Jerasi and my mother Ever Chaka
04/03/24, 10:59 am - +263 78 161 8160: It's alright Ma'am thank you
04/03/24, 11:00 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright @263781618160 , I hope your parents are aware that you have applied for the scholarship program that would lead you to study abroad? And are they willing to support you financially for your higher education?
04/03/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 161 8160: Yes Ma'am they are aware of that,but financially they might have a challenge somehow
04/03/24, 11:40 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know what challenges are they facing?
04/03/24, 12:08 pm - +263 78 161 8160: They might not manage ma'am
04/03/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 161 8160: I am having a misunderstanding here Ma'am do you mean in everything that has to do with having a scholarship including fees,food,Visa taking humpers etc or you mean in terms of what I had a misunderstanding there
04/03/24, 12:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like to inform you that, we provide scholarships that range from 50%-100% on the tuition fees, 

If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role are not visa fees or flight tickets because the visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times, maybe twice or once, because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered. So they learn and do internships at breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often, so considering the travel fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
04/03/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 161 8160: Okay Ma'am noted
04/03/24, 12:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what challenges they are facing?
04/03/24, 12:43 pm - +263 78 161 8160: They do not a source of getting money Ma'am
04/03/24, 12:45 pm - +263 78 161 8160: Maybe they might need to discuss sometime but I don't think  they can afford
04/03/24, 1:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 161 8160: Thanks Ma'am
04/03/24, 2:20 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would want you to go through this PDF, and discuss it with your family briefly.

05/03/24, 11:30 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you were able to discuss the cost of education?
