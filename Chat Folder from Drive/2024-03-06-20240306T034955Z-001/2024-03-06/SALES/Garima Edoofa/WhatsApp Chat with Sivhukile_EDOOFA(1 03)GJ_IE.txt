b) $1500-$3000

c) The purpose of Earn While You Learn program is to all the students to look for funds so that they pay part of the fees. It also allows students to be able to source funds for traveling while learning and attending conferences. Gadgets such as laptops and internet bundles for research purposes are needed so that information can be easily accessed. Food and accomodation when conducting the research is needed as the research is carried out in different areas.

d) I think I should be accepted in the Edoofa program because I have the required qualifications. The gap that has been left out by other researchers is giving problems to the progress of the society hence if the gap is closed the community will realise the great work done and have a problem lessened society. So that I can help my community on how to carry out credible research since I would have aquired better knowledge.

e) parents all dead.

04/03/24, 2:15 pm - +263 71 567 4671: Edoofa stands between the students and the University that one got a placement. It pays part of the fees charged by a University. It gives the students time to work so that they (students) will be able to buy other things besides fees. The EWYL becames a key factor on students.
04/03/24, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, indeed.
