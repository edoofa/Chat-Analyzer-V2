*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.
*3) Public Prosecutor*

04/03/24, 9:59 pm - +263 77 701 0801: Thank you  Ms Garima  
Good night  to you all
05/03/24, 8:50 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263777010801 @263781903970, Hope you are doing well.

I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
05/03/24, 9:10 am - +263 77 701 0801: Good  morning  Ms Garima , good  morning  everyone
05/03/24, 9:19 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
05/03/24, 9:26 am - +263 77 701 0801: Okay if I were given the opportunity to pursue higher education through a scholarship, I would definitely use what I learn to contribute to the education system in my home country. I believe that international exposure is crucial for developing a well-rounded education system, and I would want to share my knowledge and experiences with my fellow students and educators.
I would use my knowledge to develop new teaching methods and curriculums that incorporate international perspectives and best practices. I would also want to create opportunities for more students to study abroad and bring their experiences back to our country. This could be done through scholarships, exchange programs, or other initiatives.
05/03/24, 9:44 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Nomakhosi, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
05/03/24, 10:00 am - +263 77 701 0801: Yes l do
05/03/24, 10:00 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
05/03/24, 11:38 am - +263 77 701 0801: Yes please

05/03/24, 1:06 pm - +263 77 701 0801: Yes maam l understand
05/03/24, 1:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well @263777010801 , since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
05/03/24, 1:09 pm - +263 77 701 0801: My network is low  for now 
Tha pictures  are still downloading
05/03/24, 1:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: I can understand that network can be a challenge, please.
05/03/24, 1:18 pm - +263 77 701 0801: Okay l can say there are several ways in which studying in India can have a positive impact on my career:

Firstly , studying in India will expose me to a different academic culture and learning environment, helping me develop skills that will make me a more attractive candidate for future job opportunities.

 Secondly, studying in India will also provide me with a global perspective, which is increasingly important in today's interconnected world.
 
 Thirdly, the exposure to a different culture will allow me to develop my communication and interpersonal skills, making me a more well-rounded individual.
05/03/24, 1:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, @263777010801 . I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
05/03/24, 1:38 pm - +263 77 701 0801: I'm not sure. I think l even asked for a breakdown of the expenses so I can know where I stand
05/03/24, 1:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/03/24, 1:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 1:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, Don't you think it is affordable for you and your family?
05/03/24, 1:50 pm - +263 77 701 0801: It's fair. We can cut down on other expenses in order to raise the required amount
05/03/24, 1:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words @263777010801 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/03/24, 1:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, if you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc.
05/03/24, 1:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are you thoughts about the same?
05/03/24, 8:05 pm - +263 77 701 0801: Well  that's  okay
05/03/24, 8:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/03/24, 8:40 pm - +263 77 701 0801: How about it
05/03/24, 8:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/03/24, 8:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

05/03/24, 8:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
05/03/24, 8:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

05/03/24, 8:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 8:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
05/03/24, 9:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time.
