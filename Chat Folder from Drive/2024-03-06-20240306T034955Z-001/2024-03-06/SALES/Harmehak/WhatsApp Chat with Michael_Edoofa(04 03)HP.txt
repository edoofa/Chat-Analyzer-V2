Congratulations for Sailing Through!
05/03/24, 2:00 pm - +263 71 328 3819: 😄wow , thank you a lot guy🙏


You don't know how happy i am🥳🥳🥳🥳
05/03/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - +263 71 328 3819: So what's next
05/03/24, 2:01 pm - +263 71 328 3819: 😄😄
05/03/24, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: Michael, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.

To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
05/03/24, 2:06 pm - +263 71 328 3819: This sounds really amazing! I also heard the top 20 are offered  scholarships as well?
05/03/24, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Michael, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 2:17 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Yes
05/03/24, 2:17 pm - +263 71 328 3819: I have
05/03/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Michael, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
05/03/24, 2:34 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay great
05/03/24, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: I await your response!
05/03/24, 2:44 pm - +263 71 328 3819: My name is Michael T Mwerenga and I'm the eldest child in my family. I have two young siblings. I learnt at Mandedza High School which is a boarding school, both A and O level. I managed to score 9A's and 2B'sat form4  and 15 points ( Mathematics (A), Chemistry (A) and Physics (A) during my A levels. I wish to study medicine and surgeylry and my greatest strengths involve excellent Mathematical skills I also believe  to be a polymath.  My weaknesses as a person are : i am an introvert and I kinda find it hard to play an musical instrument though i haven't  seriously  tried one. I usually  read finance books during my free time or Meditate  on the Bible. But my favourite hobby  is watching  history documentaries.
05/03/24, 2:45 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Michael, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
05/03/24, 2:46 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Family background  

I am a warm-hearted brother of two young sisters. My father is a police officer at a local police station and my mother works at a beauty shop as a hairdresser. 
I was born at Seke South Maternity Clinic, after birth, my mother left for South Africa looking for a job and she became a hair stylist. I was left with my father at our modest home in Chitungwiza, Unit J. My father was a student police officer at that time, and his salary was hardly enough to support the family. My mother worked hard beyond the borders and sent necessities to my father's rescue, but to no avail, we constantly had break ins annually, given the neighborhood and absence of an older person to tend the home most of the time. 
I attended the nearest primary school to our home, Seke 7 Primary School. 
At my previous high school most of my friends called me a polymath, which brought me back to Benjamin Franklin, Leonardo DaVinci, and Elon Musk, who are some of the greatest polymaths who shaped and are shaping the world with their innovations. In my humble circumstances and despite the challenges of my parents making education a reality for me, I feel I can be able to achieve the best this life can offer. I dream myself becoming one of the greatest and humble anesthesiologist saving the people from complicated during and post-surgery pain. 
 My mother is now back in Zimbabwe given the social upheaval in South Africa, her earnings per month have dramatically decreased and my fathers health has deteriorated in the past 12 months; this all has become greater motivation for me to change my life and my family`s lives!
05/03/24, 2:46 pm - +263 71 328 3819: It's  a pleaseure sharing  these things with you.
05/03/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: It's a pleasure to know about them, Michael.
05/03/24, 3:04 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Great!
05/03/24, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: So, could you kindly tell me how much the school charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
05/03/24, 3:05 pm - +263 71 328 3819: 450 USD and it's usually both of my parents.
05/03/24, 3:06 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Which they are currently  struggling  to raise anyway.
05/03/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
05/03/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: Your resilience and determination in the face of adversity are truly admirable. Despite the challenges your family has faced, you've maintained a steadfast commitment to your education and your dreams.
05/03/24, 3:25 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Thank you😊
05/03/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome!
05/03/24, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Michael, as we proceed ahead, I had a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study medicine, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
05/03/24, 3:26 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay
05/03/24, 3:28 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Many healthcare personnel such as physicians, nurses, doctors, anaesthetists, and paramedics are often perceived by people as individuals with a primary objective to cure diseases and complicated injuries. However, my aspiration to become an anaesthetist is driven by a deeper purpose.

Growing up in my humble community, I had the privilege of interacting with health ministry personnel who came to educate us about hygiene and other health-related matters. These encounters, coupled with visits to the hospital, instilled in me a life purpose to inspire and pursue a successful career in healthcare. My goal is to be part of a team that saves people from public health threats, particularly suicides and addictions. I chose to become an anaesthetist because it requires a significant portion of my empathetic personality and active listening skills. These skills will enable me to interact with patients in a comforting and counseling manner. Comforting and counseling surgery patients is a crucial aspect of my work because psychological distress can delay wound healing and compromise immunity, leading to even more severe diseases.

As an anaesthetist, I understand that my influence will not be limited to the hospital. I also aim to work with organizations such as the Batsirai Health and Welfare Trust or the Population Service International to contribute to the health of my community.

Although anaesthetists have a good work-life balance, I realize that I will not have much free time. However, inspiring others to pursue good mental health is an integral part of my life's purpose. I aspire to create podcasts that highlight the significance of mental health, which could be broadcast on national radio. This is because most deaths due to suicides and addictions stem from a weak and poor mindset. Countries such as Sweden have proved to the world how great mental health podcats have impacted the mental health of their country.

Even though I may not have the opportunity to build hospitals, clinics, and research centres, which are part of my dream, I am confident that my passion for inspiring and becoming a healthcare professional is sufficient to make a positive impact on my community and my country, Zimbabwe.
05/03/24, 3:34 pm - +263 71 328 3819: So basically  if i do medicine  and Surgery  i will be able to upgrade  to become an anaesthetist. Which is the profession that my heart yearns for.
05/03/24, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: Your dedication to improving public health through empathy, active listening, and mental health advocacy is truly inspiring. This demonstrates a deep understanding of the importance of psychological well-being in overall health. Your commitment to community health initiatives and mental health awareness podcasts reflects a proactive approach to addressing public health challenges. 

Your journey in healthcare promises to be both impactful and fulfilling.
05/03/24, 3:41 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Thank you🙏
05/03/24, 3:42 pm - Harmehak: May I have your O and A level results in a picture format.
05/03/24, 3:42 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay wait
05/03/24, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
05/03/24, 3:43 pm - +263 71 328 3819: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Great results, Michael!
05/03/24, 3:46 pm - +263 71 328 3819: <Media omitted>
05/03/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Received please!
05/03/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: So what all did you happen to research about the requirements for Medicine, Michael!

What is your take on the importance of Biology to study medicine?
05/03/24, 3:53 pm - +263 71 328 3819: I dont think  it is that relevant.  What matters is my chemistry knowledge  and Mathematical skills(which would help me with reasoning)
05/03/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

However don't you Biology is rather more important than Physics even in Zimbabwe?

Considering from my experience 90% of the students opt for MCB and not PCM.
05/03/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: Equally taking a notice that Biology is all about human and living beings and so is medicine.
05/03/24, 4:05 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Oh yes that is true. But with PCM see i can frankly do any science program.
05/03/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!
05/03/24, 4:08 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
05/03/24, 4:37 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay then, so I can take Electrical and electronics  if that is the case.
05/03/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
05/03/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
05/03/24, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same you are eligible for Engineering Degrees.
05/03/24, 4:40 pm - +263 71 328 3819: I would prefer Electrical  and electronics  engineering instead
05/03/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/03/24, 6:59 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Okay noted
05/03/24, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: Wishing you a blessed evening ahead.
05/03/24, 7:10 pm - +263 71 328 3819: Likewise , thank you😊
