*Your results for the ESAT 2024 is 62/100*

Congratulations for Sailing Through!
05/03/24, 2:30 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Thank you
05/03/24, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!

So Spiwe, we understand you have gone through the Brochures and Flyers of the Edoofa Program.
To emphasize  *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and has been rewarding meritorious students to lower their Fee Structure less than what you will end up paying at the Local Zimbabwe University.
05/03/24, 2:45 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Yes
05/03/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Kundai, as we start discussing your results further, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 


Qualification to the ESAT Exam (Please note EDOOFA calculates your results based on the TOP performers' Score so it is the percentile that we will be evaluating on)
A Level and Previous Results 
*Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 
*Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these Four  significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/03/24, 3:45 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Kundai!
05/03/24, 5:07 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Yes I do
05/03/24, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/03/24, 7:04 pm - +263 78 899 9828: Okay noted, thank you for your time
05/03/24, 7:22 pm - +263 77 300 0039: thank you for adding me
