It was just a discussion I did not say that thus the program he wants. He will update about what he is  upto
05/03/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: While I understand,

In that case did you or Edwin ever happen to research about the requirements for these fields in Zimbabwe or India please?
05/03/24, 11:19 am - +263 77 666 6544: Yes we did here in Zimbabwe  , but this was a wish.

Can you please help us with programs you offer which suits his results please so that will discuss with him once he is reachable
05/03/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

However chemistry/physics are crucial requirements for both the fields.
05/03/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: And since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
05/03/24, 11:22 am - +263 77 666 6544: Well , so which programs do you offer that suits his results so that we start from there
05/03/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*
