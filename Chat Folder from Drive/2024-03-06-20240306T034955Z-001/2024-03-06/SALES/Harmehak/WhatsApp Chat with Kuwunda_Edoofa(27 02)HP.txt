28/02/24, 9:35 am - Harmehak: Well received, Kuwunda, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/02/24, 9:38 am - +260 97 2579800: Interesting

28/02/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.

I would also love to explore my career world starting with Edoofa.
28/02/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Its good to know that you realise the opportunity and that you are willing to make efforts for a promising future, Kuwunda.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*

28/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

28/02/24, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
28/02/24, 12:09 pm - +260 97 2579800: Not aware
28/02/24, 12:12 pm - +260 97 2579800: No neither my family nor I am familiar.
28/02/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
28/02/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 12:18 pm - +260 97 2579800: Noted thanks
28/02/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Kuwunda, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/02/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
28/02/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
28/02/24, 12:19 pm - +260 97 2579800: I learnt this from my friend Twazanga.
28/02/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
28/02/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the higher quantum of scholarship, Kuwunda?
28/02/24, 12:26 pm - +260 97 2579800: I strongly think it is a good way of helping people like me that cannot afford extremely high prices of education like that.
I am greatly honoured to have interviews!
28/02/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words!
28/02/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
28/02/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/02/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/02/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

28/02/24, 12:37 pm - +260 97 2579800: Thank you for the information.
28/02/24, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

28/02/24, 12:42 pm - +260 97 2579800: If I earn more in that particular year how will the rest of the money be used?
28/02/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 12:45 pm - +260 97 2579800: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 12:46 pm - +260 97 2579800: That would even be better thank you.
28/02/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

The Earn While You Learn Program helps you reduce your fee itself.

Now if you are left with a balance after the completion of your course, you can get the same as well.
28/02/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/02/24, 12:49 pm - +260 97 2579800: Yes I would.
28/02/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 12:52 pm - +260 97 2579800: Yes it's now totally different.
28/02/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!

Have you followed all the shared resources, Kuwunda?
28/02/24, 12:53 pm - +260 97 2579800: Yes I have.
28/02/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
28/02/24, 12:55 pm - +260 97 2579800: Yes I am
28/02/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Kuwunda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
28/02/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/02/24, 1:02 pm - +260 97 2579800: In the ranges of 1500 to 2250 USD.
28/02/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/02/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
28/02/24, 1:03 pm - +260 97 2579800: That's a huge difference
28/02/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
28/02/24, 1:04 pm - +260 97 2579800: Noted thanks
28/02/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Kuwunda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/02/24, 1:07 pm - +260 97 2579800: Of course!
28/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/02/24, 1:11 pm - +260 97 2579800: That is fairly carried out.
28/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
28/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
28/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
28/02/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
28/02/24, 1:14 pm - +260 97 2579800: Yes I do
28/02/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
28/02/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
28/02/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

28/02/24, 1:20 pm - +260 97 2579800: Noted thank you
28/02/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Kuwunda, so far would you like to ask anything?
28/02/24, 1:24 pm - +260 97 2579800: No not yet.
28/02/24, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Alright, I believe you are connected with Twazanga, who is currently in India?
28/02/24, 1:26 pm - +260 97 2579800: Yes I am
28/02/24, 1:27 pm - Harmehak: Great, do connect your parents with Twazanga as well so that they can hear from a student who is in India right now itself!
28/02/24, 1:28 pm - +260 97 2579800: I will
28/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: That's good!
28/02/24, 1:30 pm - +260 97 2579800: So when can we have the next session?
28/02/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: Tomorrow we will begin with Stage 2
28/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
28/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
28/02/24, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “29-02-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!

28/02/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: Thank you Kuwunda!
29/02/24, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Everyone, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
29/02/24, 11:42 am - +260 97 2579800: Good morning thank you.
Yes we can proceed.
29/02/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Sure please,

29/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: What all did you happen to discuss with them?
29/02/24, 11:48 am - +260 97 2579800: We discussed the pros and cons of higher education and how my life would be completely changed.
29/02/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

So far what all would you or your parents like to ask?
29/02/24, 11:52 am - +260 97 2579800: I would like to ask if you offer courses that only deal with accounts as a major.
29/02/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor of Commerce - Honors in Accounting is a degree for a major in accounting itself, Kuwunda.
29/02/24, 12:02 pm - +260 97 2579800: Okay then.
We can proceed.
29/02/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.

Is there anything else that you or your parents would like to ask?
29/02/24, 12:12 pm - +260 97 2579800: Not as of now.
29/02/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Okay so in that case, I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

*It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!*
29/02/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 12:23 pm - +260 97 2579800: That's so incredible.
29/02/24, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please,

Did you also happen to connect your friend with your parents, Kuwunda?
29/02/24, 12:27 pm - +260 97 2579800: Not as of yet.
29/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Were you facing any challenge please?
29/02/24, 12:29 pm - +260 97 2579800: Not at all
29/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Twazanga in that case.
29/02/24, 12:30 pm - +260 97 2579800: Okay
Let me do that.
29/02/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
29/02/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Kuwunda, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
29/02/24, 12:59 pm - +260 97 2579800: 1. Bachelor's of Commerce 
2. India
3.USD 15000 to USD 35000
4.350
5.500 to 1000
6.7 days

29/02/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!
29/02/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: You can refer to our earlier discussions.

4.2000-3000
5.750
29/02/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Correct!
29/02/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: However, for answer 5 do you recall now the fee is $350?
29/02/24, 1:12 pm - +260 97 2579800: How??
29/02/24, 1:14 pm - +260 97 2579800: Because you earlier mentioned that a student would only pay 750 if they were part of the Edoofa Program.
29/02/24, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*

Do you recall when we discussed the same yesterday?
29/02/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same that $350 is paid in two installments as well once you are found eligible?
29/02/24, 1:20 pm - +260 97 2579800: Yes I now recall.
29/02/24, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
✅️c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.

c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.
