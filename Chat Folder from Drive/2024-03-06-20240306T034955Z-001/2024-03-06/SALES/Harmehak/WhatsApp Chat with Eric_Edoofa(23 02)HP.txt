We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

24/02/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Currently we are in the process to discuss the same itself!
24/02/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: So, now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
24/02/24, 7:17 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Yes I have some questions and I also want to know why you recommend india as a higher education platform
24/02/24, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

24/02/24, 9:34 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Ok thank you Ms Harmehak for sharing this information with me I'm happy to hear this.
25/02/24, 10:07 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
25/02/24, 9:58 pm - +263 78 106 8270: We dont have any idea about those Fees Ms Harmehak
26/02/24, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Good morning, I hope you are doing well.
26/02/24, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Alright please
26/02/24, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/02/24, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/02/24, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/02/24, 9:00 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/02/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Eric!
26/02/24, 3:33 pm - +27 84 945 0497: How do you pay this 2000.
Once or in installments
26/02/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: Let me provide you a better clarity regarding the same as well.
26/02/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
27/02/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I was expecting to hear from you earlier, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start?
27/02/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: @263781068270 @27849450497
27/02/24, 12:17 pm - +27 84 945 0497: Hello
27/02/24, 12:17 pm - +27 84 945 0497: I am here
27/02/24, 12:18 pm - +27 84 945 0497: Time difference..where l am its 5 am
27/02/24, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, However may I know why Eric isn't actively participating please?
27/02/24, 12:21 pm - +27 84 945 0497: Like l mentioned...time difference. He is not with me.
27/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
27/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Were you able to follow the same?
27/02/24, 1:07 pm - +27 84 945 0497: Yeah
27/02/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1800, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $900 in the first semester and $900 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
27/02/24, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected, Eric?
27/02/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: @263781068270 

I am expecting your response, Eric!

May I know what challenges are you facing currently?
27/02/24, 4:38 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Good evening Ms Harmehak sorry for late reply. I was out of bundle for the past two days.
27/02/24, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: Do you have enough data now please?
27/02/24, 6:39 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Yes Ms Harmehak now I have it
27/02/24, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
27/02/24, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: Eric, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
27/02/24, 7:18 pm - +263 78 106 8270: I agree Ms Harmehak
27/02/24, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: So now comparing the costs in India and Zimbabwe are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
27/02/24, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: @263781068270
27/02/24, 7:55 pm - +27 84 945 0497: mmu still looking at it with another angle
27/02/24, 7:55 pm - +27 84 945 0497: Fascinating isn't?
27/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please
27/02/24, 7:58 pm - +27 84 945 0497: I am sure there is also disadvantages right???
27/02/24, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: Which disadvantages are you referring to please?
27/02/24, 8:00 pm - +27 84 945 0497: Everything has its own advantages and disadvantages. 
So what are the disadvantages of Edoofa
27/02/24, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: While I am unaware of what exactly are you referring to.

I would be in a better position to address your concerns if you share a query.
27/02/24, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: Do you believe we would have such a huge number of students as a part of the program along with a commitment and association from such reputed people all over Zimbabwe?
27/02/24, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: While the principal of Chibuwe High School is also associated with Edoofa and has a child in India too.
27/02/24, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/02/24, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 7:45 am - Harmehak: Good morning Everyone, hope you are doing well!

I am expecting to hear from you!

28/02/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 106 8270: Morning Ms Harmehak. So when are your intakes?
28/02/24, 10:35 am - +263 78 106 8270: Hi
28/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: The intake is for August this year.

Your friend Belinda Dube along with various other students from Chibuwe High school will be coming to India this year in August.
28/02/24, 10:38 am - +27 84 945 0497: Morning Sir

So let's Eric has been granted the offer letter and scholarship..His fees is limited to $1200  to 1500 $ as you have said  or ?
28/02/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: I am Ms Harmehak please.
28/02/24, 10:40 am - Harmehak: If Eric performs well in the evaluation, he can get a higher quantum of scholarship that is better $1200-1800.

The same would include tuition fee, accomodation, food and basic university expenses.
28/02/24, 10:42 am - +27 84 945 0497: Okay..now we are on the same page.
So when and how does he perform the evaluation
28/02/24, 10:44 am - Harmehak: While the Counseling session is taken into equal consideration, once the same is completed his responses in test and interview will be evaluated along with the Academic results.
28/02/24, 10:45 am - +27 84 945 0497: When can he do that??
28/02/24, 10:46 am - +27 84 945 0497: The interview and the test??
28/02/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: I will brief you regarding the same today itself.

However active participation is required for the same.
28/02/24, 10:47 am - +27 84 945 0497: Okay
28/02/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
28/02/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/02/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/02/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

28/02/24, 10:54 am - +27 84 945 0497: How long does it take for one to finish the evaluation and to get  the offer letter??
28/02/24, 10:54 am - Harmehak: If a student and parents are active, its usually doesn't take more than a week!
28/02/24, 11:01 am - +263 78 106 8270: OK. I need to know something Ms Harmehak. Is it a must to return home as soon as a student finish his/her education?
28/02/24, 11:02 am - +27 84 945 0497: Or after every  semester
28/02/24, 11:02 am - +263 78 106 8270: Ok noted Ms Harmehak
28/02/24, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
28/02/24, 11:13 am - Harmehak: They have semester breaks every year where its a personal choice if they wish to visit back home or explore India.
28/02/24, 11:16 am - +263 78 106 8270: Ok thank you I got it
28/02/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: That's good
28/02/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
28/02/24, 11:26 am - +263 78 106 8270: Ok ok  now it's more clear to me why you were saying it is a good choice to study with Edoofa Scholarship Program
28/02/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
28/02/24, 11:30 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/02/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: I look forward to the same!
28/02/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 11:58 am - +263 78 106 8270: Yes that's it Ms Harmehak
28/02/24, 11:59 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
28/02/24, 12:01 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Yes I'm ready Ms Harmehak i will be proactive.
28/02/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Eric, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
28/02/24, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/02/24, 12:10 pm - +263 78 106 8270: If applying to one University cost 300 to 450 this means   costs of  applying to 5 university will be range from 1200 to 2250
28/02/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/02/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
28/02/24, 12:16 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Ok ok  Ms Harmehak 350 sounds affordable
28/02/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please.
28/02/24, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Eric, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/02/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 106 8270: I think so Ms Harmehak. So if I'm not mistaken, are we saying 350 can cover Visa costs and the above mentioned?
28/02/24, 12:21 pm - +263 78 106 8270: And at the same we are saying if a student pay 350 for as application fee, Edoofa offer a guarantee admission?
28/02/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 106 8270: OK thank you Ms Harmehak for briefly explain on this.
28/02/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/02/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/02/24, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Yahh truly Edoofa is doing a great job. It sounds good too
28/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
28/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
28/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
28/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
28/02/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
28/02/24, 12:32 pm - +263 78 106 8270: I got you Ms Harmehak I'm ready for the first step
28/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Well understood Ms Harmehak
28/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: We will be concluding Stage 1 today.
28/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
28/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
28/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

28/02/24, 12:35 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Ok Ms Harmehak it and I'm sure my family too will understand that
28/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
28/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
28/02/24, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

28/02/24, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents/guardians with both Mrs Ruth and Belinda!

Feel free to communicate with Mr Needmore regarding the program as well.
28/02/24, 12:46 pm - +263 78 106 8270: OK Ms Harmehak we will as you said
28/02/24, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: As of now would you like to ask anything?
28/02/24, 12:51 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Sorry  typing error , " we will do as yu said"
28/02/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: I do understand
28/02/24, 12:56 pm - +263 78 106 8270: So as for step 1 Am  I going to do it here with you Ms Harmehak
28/02/24, 12:57 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Unfortunately Mrs Ruth Magwanda seems to be offline
28/02/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: Step 1 that is the Counseling stage is concluded as we communicate.

You would begin with Stage 2 tomorrow.
28/02/24, 1:01 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Ok Ms Harmehak
28/02/24, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: She will get in touch once available!

Your parents can have a direct call with her as well.
28/02/24, 1:04 pm - +263 78 106 8270: Ok
28/02/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
28/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
28/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

29/02/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: So, have you all already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? 

You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success. The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future.

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

To a greater extent it is true Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient. 

To commence with low fertility soil as a factor which lead to poor diets in African Countries.The lack of these nutrients in the soil causes deficiencies in plants, and their excess leads to toxicities, which have negative impacts on crop yields therefore this will lead to poor diets to the people after consuming their harvest therefore 
these nutritional deficiencies have resulted in negative health effects such as obesity, stunted growth, eye problems, and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.

To add the above, limited access to relevant technology also affect African countries and become inefficient . By lack of relevant technology African farmers may not able to control some paste and disease because they might lack knowledge as compared on European Countries and many others  

Additional unfavorable climate changes also makes African farms to be inefficient. Because of unfavorable climate changes may lead to drought and desease therefore it will lead to poor human diets in most African countries.

In addition lack of ground water also lead to inefficient and stagnant of African farms. Depletion of water resources directly affects agricultural production and escalates food insecurity therefore this will lead to lack of sufficient food people hence affecting their diets.


However to a lesser extent some factors like technological advance is often blamed for the loss of biodiversity

In conclusion Africans have poor diets because of their farm are stagnant and inefficient.

04/03/24, 8:17 am - Harmehak: Sure please!

So as parents/guardians, now that you are aware of the entire process and the financial aspect of program.

Are you willing to support Eric's higher education in India both mentally and financially?
04/03/24, 8:17 am - Harmehak: If so, kindly acknowledge using a voice note.
04/03/24, 8:19 am - +27 84 945 0497: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 8:20 am - Harmehak: Duly received please.
04/03/24, 8:20 am - Harmehak: You see as per my experience over the last couple of years, I have been fortunate to have assisted over hundreds of students in achieving their career aspiration through the Edoofa Program. 

One of my key observations during helping out these students was regarding what was the common trait amongst students who are today having the best of their time in India through the Edoofa Program, and honestly I was able to come down to only one aspect that is FAMILY SUPPORT.
04/03/24, 8:20 am - Harmehak: You see in this journey of any child's higher education, there are three major contributors 

1. Student himself/herself
2. FAMILY
3. EDOOFA PROGAM

Now all the students who are today successfully a part of the Edoofa Program, had all these three contributors working together towards the common goal which is student's success and ensuring that by the time student completes his/her higher education they should be able to get good paying jobs. 

Even if any one of the contributor does not perform to the best of their abilities, Student's overall success is hampered. Let me give you a few examples

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Edoofa is willing to support but the Family is not willing to support, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if student wishes to work hard, Family is willing to support, but Edoofa's academic Board doesn't find the student worthy, the student will not be successful under the program*

*In the event if Family is willing to support, Edoofa's Academic Board is willing to support but the student doesn't wishes to work hard, then also the student will not be successful under the program*
04/03/24, 8:20 am - Harmehak: During the evaluation of your child's application so far, the Academic Board has evaluated a few aspects, such as student's willingness to work hard, and family's willingness to support the student so that the student can achieve what he/she has aspired. However now in your interview ahead, the Academic Board would be strictly be evaluating the Family's support towards the child higher education. 

*As you know in the event if your child is found eligible, you would have to complete a certain part of the formalities within the 7 day timeline, so may I know regarding the same, are you willing to support your child to the fullest?*
04/03/24, 8:31 am - +27 84 945 0497: Yes
04/03/24, 8:32 am - +27 84 945 0497: As a family, We are willing to support Eric
04/03/24, 8:32 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
04/03/24, 8:32 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
04/03/24, 8:32 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
04/03/24, 8:32 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/03/24, 8:32 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 11th or 12th March 2024 for $200 and the 11th or 12th of April for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 11th or 12th March 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
04/03/24, 8:37 am - +27 84 945 0497: 1st
