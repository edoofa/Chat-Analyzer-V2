29/02/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: Received please
29/02/24, 10:35 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/02/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
29/02/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 494 7026: Thanks for the infor
29/02/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: You're welcome
29/02/24, 10:47 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship please?
29/02/24, 10:53 am - +263 77 494 7026: From my understanding was told you offer 50%
29/02/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: We offer 50-100% scholarship on Tuition fee please.
29/02/24, 11:10 am - +263 77 494 7026: Oh ok
29/02/24, 11:11 am - Harmehak: Along with the same, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
29/02/24, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you, I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
04/03/24, 4:19 pm - +263 71 307 2498: Helo
04/03/24, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: How are you doing today?
04/03/24, 4:21 pm - +263 71 307 2498: Am better
04/03/24, 4:21 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
04/03/24, 4:21 pm - +263 71 307 2498: So you take students who get how many points
04/03/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: Excuse me for not being connect earlier as I was facing technical issues.
04/03/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you please!

Can you elaborate?
04/03/24, 4:22 pm - +263 71 307 2498: Okay it's not a problem
04/03/24, 4:23 pm - +263 71 307 2498: You provide a scholarship to students who got how many points
04/03/24, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
04/03/24, 4:25 pm - +263 71 307 2498: Okay thank you
04/03/24, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Anotida, what all do you recall from our previous discussions?
04/03/24, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/03/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
05/03/24, 9:36 am - +263 71 307 2498: Yes we can start
05/03/24, 9:38 am - Harmehak: I await your response, Anotida.
05/03/24, 9:47 am - +263 71 307 2498: I recalled that there is a great difference between scholarship and sponsorship
05/03/24, 9:49 am - +263 71 307 2498: Scholarship make fees reduced and sponsorship provides everything
05/03/24, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Very correct,

What else please?
05/03/24, 9:53 am - +263 71 307 2498: You consider anyone with 2 A'levels when providing scholarship
05/03/24, 9:57 am - Harmehak: Scholarship is provided on merit basis.
05/03/24, 10:12 am - +263 71 307 2498: Yed
05/03/24, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Can you please reshare our previous discussion with me?
05/03/24, 10:37 am - +263 71 307 2498: Yes
