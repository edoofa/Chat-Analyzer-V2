We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

17/02/24, 11:11 am - +263 77 879 2337: <Media omitted>
17/02/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Received please!
17/02/24, 11:20 am - Harmehak: So what exactly would you like to study, Descent?
17/02/24, 11:24 am - +263 77 879 2337: I would like to study Agricultural sciences(Agronomy,plant  breeding, horticulture,crop improvement and economics
17/02/24, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Descent!

So what motivates you for the same and whall did you research regarding the course and requirements?
17/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 77 879 2337: Like I had said my Father is a farmer so that is what I do since I was younger and l know that there is more work specifications you can do and l heard that the requirements should be from different areas of subjects like the association of business studies Crop science and also geographical information may be required
17/02/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Descent!

While I understand what you are sharing I happened to notice that other students from Mt Selinda had Biology in their subject combination instead of Buisness studies!

What are your thoughts on the same?
17/02/24, 11:50 am - +263 77 879 2337: Are like there l really don't know how you take it maybe you can help
17/02/24, 11:51 am - +263 77 879 2337: Because I did business studies so as to have knowledge on business on the program since there is also economics in the program but those with biology do not have the knowledge of business which is on the program
17/02/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: While I understand, you see Bachelor of science honors in Agriculture is a science degree itself.

Biology happens to be a crucial requirement for the same.
17/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 879 2337: Ooh ok so l can't do this program right
17/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Unfortunately your subject combination donot qualify for the same.
17/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: Are you aware of Audrey from your school?
17/02/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 879 2337: Ohh ok so can u advice me of where l can qualify
17/02/24, 12:12 pm - +263 77 879 2337: No
17/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 879 2337: You can refer me to him
17/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: I am referring to Katsaura Vimbai Audrey, child of Mrs Mavis.
17/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 77 879 2337: Oook yuh l know her  but lknow her as Vimbai katsaura
17/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!

She happened to have similar interests as of you, however her subjects didn't qualify for Bsc Agriculture as well.

After the counseling session she and Mrs Mavis realised how Bachelor in Geography will help her pursue her dreams!
17/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Shall I share more details with you?
17/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 77 879 2337: Yuh share with me
17/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: A Bachelor in Geography degree can provide a solid foundation for a career in the field of geology. Some of the common career paths for Geography graduates with an interest in geology include:

Geologist: Study the physical characteristics and processes of the Earth, including its rocks, minerals, and oil and gas resources.

Environmental Geologist: Assess and manage the impact of human activities on the environment, such as the impact of mining and oil and gas extraction.

Hydrogeologist: Study the distribution and movement of water underground and on the surface of the Earth.

Petroleum Geologist: Explore for and evaluate oil and gas reserves.

Mining Geologist: Plan and supervise the extraction of minerals and other geological resources.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) Specialist: Use computer software to analyze and visualize geographical data, including geological data.

Geography Professor/Lecturer: Teach and conduct research in geography and related fields, including geology.

These are just a few examples of careers that a Bachelor in Geography degree combined with an interest in geology can lead to. The exact career path will depend on the individual's interests, skills, and experience.
17/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, Geography also plays a crucial role in determining the type of agriculture that can be practiced in a particular region. Factors such as climate, soil type, topography, and water availability all influence the types of crops that can be grown and the farming practices that can be employed.

Additionally, geography also impacts the distribution and transportation of agricultural products, as well as the development of agricultural economies and trade patterns. Understanding the geographical context of agriculture is essential for effective land use planning, resource management, and sustainable agricultural development.

Many geographic factors affect today’s modern agricultural businesses and trade. From climate to key trade and shipping hubs, location has shaped the fortunes of states and agricultural production.

28/02/24, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

Did you happen to research more after our discussion?
28/02/24, 2:55 pm - +263 78 954 5636: Aah actually no because of network on this side
28/02/24, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: You haven't been in a stable network since 16th please?
28/02/24, 2:57 pm - +263 78 954 5636: Yuh it was hard
28/02/24, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: I understand, Thembinkosi!
28/02/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue Bachelor of Arts Honors in Geography?

28/02/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!

I await your response to the second part of the question.
28/02/24, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: If you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
28/02/24, 3:15 pm - +263 78 954 5636: Ok eeh l think due to its educational standarde which are high it may enable me to good access to job offers which fulfill my dreams
28/02/24, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: That is great Thembinkosi, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/02/24, 3:23 pm - +263 78 954 5636: Yuh because there a wide variety of flexible programs at ur university than all other universities here
28/02/24, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mr. Piyush- Head of Counseling were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
28/02/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 954 5636: Yuh that's how the situation is here haa it's difficult
28/02/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: I understand, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future, Thembinkosi!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

28/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you have awareness!
28/02/24, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:
