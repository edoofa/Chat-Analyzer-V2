You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Piyush who is the Head of Counseling and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
08/01/24, 9:39 am - +263 78 948 2963: It's a honor talking to you 🫡
08/01/24, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Tadiwanashe, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Claire, who recently became a part of the Edoofa Program!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
08/01/24, 9:48 am - +263 78 948 2963: This message was deleted
08/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 78 948 2963: My understanding on the edoofa program is that it empowers students to be more focused on there studies without paying any money
08/01/24, 9:52 am - +263 78 948 2963: Claire taught me that the program is efficient and was willing to change our educational lifes
08/01/24, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
08/01/24, 9:55 am - +263 78 948 2963: I mean it gets to provide extra monetary and financial support for bright students who are financially underpriviledged
08/01/24, 9:58 am - +263 78 948 2963: It also provides learning opportunities for passionate students who someway or the other are disadvantaged or are in need of a little financial boosting
08/01/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Well received, however scholarship is provided only on merit basis, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
08/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 948 2963: I am more than delighted to learn more about the scholarship program. I will also be even more grateful and happy if I could get an opportunity to study with your scholarship aid.
Of the more than 2000 Zimbabwean applications I do hope to succeed and make it through among the required 5000 worldwide
08/01/24, 10:10 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
08/01/24, 10:11 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
08/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 948 2963: I do appreciate the clarity, so in actual fact the Edoofa program is a scholarship rather than sponsorship
08/01/24, 10:14 am - +263 78 948 2963: Nevertheless it would be more than an honour for me to be aided within my tuition with help of your program
08/01/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Yes please,

Do discuss with Claire once again regarding the entire process.
08/01/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
08/01/24, 10:16 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tadiwanashe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Pakame high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
08/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 78 948 2963: Well personally   was borne on the 12th of June in 2006  I completed  O level in 2022 had 8 Bs  and 1A  and 2Bs and l am currently doing A level

08/01/24, 1:57 pm - +263 77 599 7822: Tadiwanashes first priority is to become a medical Doctor and his  second preference is in engineering (surveying)
08/01/24, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand, I can see she didn't pursue Biology in her A level, Mrs Diana!

While I believe it's a crucial science subject to be able to pursue Medicine;

What are your thoughts on the same?
08/01/24, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
08/01/24, 10:24 pm - +263 77 599 7822: Noted with thanks
08/01/24, 10:26 pm - +263 77 599 7822: Tadiwanashe is a boy/ male.Yes for his Alevel  he isn't pursuing Biology🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️
08/01/24, 10:27 pm - +263 77 599 7822: But he did it on Olevel and passed it.
09/01/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/01/24, 12:32 pm - +263 77 599 7822: Morning yes we can start . It's the first day of school so we had an opening meeting my apologies for being late
09/01/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
09/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Excuse me for the same.
09/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
09/01/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 599 7822: Okay therefore  he doesn't fit for the healthcare course . Then engineering will be best for him .
09/01/24, 1:43 pm - +263 77 599 7822: May I have the list of engineering courses offered in indian universities since Engineering is a broad subject
09/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*
09/01/24, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Along with these courses he can pursue all the engineering courses like Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science Engineering, Electrical Engineering.
09/01/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

15/01/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
15/01/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)* is a 4 year undergraduate program which is compulsory for anyone who wants to practice as a pharmacist. B. Pharmacy is study of preparing and conferring drugs and medicines for a number of illnesses and deficiencies.

Pharmacists are needed in every location and every hospital, due to which the scope of this course has increased positively. The program has been bringing out healthcare professionals from a long time and would continue to do so for years to come as the field is growing at a fast pace.

*Bachelor of Pharmacy: What is it about?*

Bachelor of Pharmacy (B.Pharma) covers all the facets of healthcare including bio-chemical areas that concern the preparation of medicines and implementing those for the right diagnose.

20/01/24, 5:13 pm - +263 77 599 7822: Hallo I have been having power supply shortages at my work place
20/01/24, 5:14 pm - +263 77 599 7822: I'm doing well
22/01/24, 7:43 am - Harmehak: Good morning
22/01/24, 7:43 am - Harmehak: I understand please
10/02/24, 7:29 pm - +263 78 948 2963: How are you
12/02/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!
12/02/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 599 7822: Morning I went and left Tadiwanashe his phone such that he will respond to you his choices he is my son but I can't choose his career path. As parents we are only there to guide him  with the right career . The only time he will be allowed to use his phone is at night after studies.
12/02/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: I do understand please!

He can follow the previous discussion and communicate his questions.
12/02/24, 9:41 pm - +263 78 948 2963: How are you
12/02/24, 9:41 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I am available
12/02/24, 9:44 pm - Harmehak: I am doing well please.

How are you?
12/02/24, 9:45 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same?
12/02/24, 9:45 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Fine l am doing very well l am in a jovial mood
12/02/24, 9:45 pm - Harmehak: That's great news
12/02/24, 9:46 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Yes
12/02/24, 9:49 pm - Harmehak: So far, what all queries do you have?
12/02/24, 10:14 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I have an interest with engineering
13/02/24, 9:36 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
13/02/24, 9:36 am - Harmehak: Which field of engineering are you inclined towards?
13/02/24, 2:36 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Aircraft
13/02/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: Now Tadiwanashe, looking at your interests, let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but as your counselor I would like to highlight a few parameters,

-This is a niche course that has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low.

- If you opt for this branch, your scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself. At the same time, if you opt for a degree like *Mechanical Engineering*, it can help to bridge you to Aeronautical, Aerospace, Automotive, etc at the same time helps to fulfill your interests to solve challenges, to bring innovations, and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as the mother of Engineering!
13/02/24, 2:43 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I am already doing mechanical mathematics
13/02/24, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

So as of now shall I brief you Mechanical Engineering itself?
13/02/24, 3:46 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Yes of course
13/02/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
13/02/24, 3:56 pm - +263 78 948 2963: This is very interesting l wish l would do all this stuff
13/02/24, 3:58 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I have always wanted to be a inventor so l want to study a variety of subjects but mainly aircraft engineering
13/02/24, 4:01 pm - Harmehak: I understand,

However I believe you are now clear that you can pursue the same through Mechanical Engineering itself?
13/02/24, 5:01 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Yes
13/02/24, 5:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright Tadiwanashe, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
13/02/24, 5:13 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I think the program can help me to inhence the flying crafts for next generations to come
13/02/24, 5:21 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Tadiwanashe, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
13/02/24, 5:27 pm - +263 78 948 2963: This is because in Zimbabwe the educational qualities are very low in terms of aircraft engineering so l want to learn alot and bring it back to Zimbabwe
13/02/24, 5:27 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I am inspired by Julius Robert Oppenheimer
13/02/24, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tadiwanashe, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
13/02/24, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

29/02/24, 10:20 am - +263 78 948 2963: Yes
29/02/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Alright!

So what all do you recall from our previous discussion, Tadiwanashe?
29/02/24, 10:22 am - +263 78 948 2963: I remember we were talking about what l would want to persue with In life
29/02/24, 10:24 am - Harmehak: Kindly highlight our last discussion for me.
29/02/24, 10:28 am - +263 78 948 2963: First you asked me which field l am more interested with and l said aircraft engineering and you said l should more strong in sectors of engineering mathematics that's all remember to be honest
29/02/24, 10:30 am - Harmehak: I hope you recall that we happened to finalize that you would like to opt for Mechanical Engineering?
29/02/24, 10:33 am - +263 78 948 2963: Yeah l would really love that
29/02/24, 10:41 am - Harmehak: That is wonderful,

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
29/02/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 948 2963: I have researched alot about India and saw that it is the leading country interms of medical studies and have also heard about Parul university
29/02/24, 10:46 am - +263 78 948 2963: What inspires about India is the creativity of Indias for example the Indias made google
29/02/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: What all did you learn and research about Parul University please?
29/02/24, 11:48 am - +263 78 948 2963: It offers 50% schoolarship for students
29/02/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: It is quite unfortunate to hear about that, since Edoofa is associated with some of the finest and the most resourceful universities in India, we are partnered up with more than 250+ Universities in India but we are not associated with Parul University because of a reason.
29/02/24, 11:54 am - Harmehak: The reason being Parul University isn't ranked under NIRF and the degrees offered by them are not recognized on a global level, it is because the founders are accused of rape. 

When we know all this about the university and the management working there, there is no way we can ever think of partnering with such universities and sending our students over there. 

For your reference, I am sharing the link to the news with you so that you can check the same for yourself.

I would be connecting you and your parents with student or parents who are associated with Edoofa. <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 12:22 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Okay thank you ma'am
29/02/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
29/02/24, 12:22 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I guess we are not familiar
29/02/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
29/02/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/02/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/02/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

29/02/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Yhooo that's a large amount of money ma'am 😦
29/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Okay l see that's much better
29/02/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I Just wish l find the schoolarship
29/02/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
29/02/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Tadiwanashe, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/02/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2300*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
29/02/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I will try to work as hard as possible ma'am
29/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Tadiwanashe
29/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: If you compare this, with living and cost of education in Zimbabwe, 

1. UZ's fee for 2024 intake is $650-$750 a semester, meaning $1300-$1500 a year for tuition.
2. Cost of accommodation is around $80-$100 a month, meaning $1000-$1200 a year.
3. Cost of food, even if you consider a simple meal of sadza and chicken curry that costs $1, so $1 a meal and 3 meals a day that is $3 a day, which means almost $1200 a year.
4. Miscellaneous expenses such as travel, internet easily cost $40-$50 a month meaning $600 a year.

All in all cost of studying at locally in Zimbabwe is be around $4000-$4800 a year!
29/02/24, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: So I believe now you must be in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, isn't it?
29/02/24, 12:40 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Yes ma'am
29/02/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
29/02/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/02/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
29/02/24, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

29/02/24, 12:50 pm - +263 78 948 2963: The EWYL program is really especially l see this Is interesting
29/02/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
29/02/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
29/02/24, 12:51 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/02/24, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the same, Tadiwanashe?
29/02/24, 6:31 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I am willing to work hard so how many points do this program require
29/02/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: There are no points,

You earn credits as per your hardwork that reduce your fee. <This message was edited>
29/02/24, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/02/24, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright
29/02/24, 6:38 pm - +263 78 948 2963: The videos are still downloading
29/02/24, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: I do understand,

These are images please.
29/02/24, 6:46 pm - +263 78 948 2963: It's fine
29/02/24, 6:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 7:26 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Yes ma'am
29/02/24, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
29/02/24, 7:27 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Ready
29/02/24, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwanashe as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
29/02/24, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/02/24, 7:31 pm - +263 78 948 2963: The student would end up spending $1500-$2250
29/02/24, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/02/24, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/02/24, 7:33 pm - +263 78 948 2963: That would be very nice for students
29/02/24, 7:33 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/02/24, 7:38 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I really think so ma'am the program is really changing our lifes
29/02/24, 7:39 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/02/24, 7:39 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
29/02/24, 7:39 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/02/24, 7:42 pm - +263 78 948 2963: That's a very kind offer from you it's true in Africa things are really tough
29/02/24, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
29/02/24, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
29/02/24, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
29/02/24, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process properly and how the entire application would be proceeding for the further stages?
29/02/24, 7:47 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Indeed l have understood
29/02/24, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
29/02/24, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 7:50 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Okay ma'am
29/02/24, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
29/02/24, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

29/02/24, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: Sure please!

29/02/24, 7:53 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!
29/02/24, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: Do request your parents to connect with Mrs Ruth as well!
29/02/24, 7:55 pm - +263 78 948 2963: I will inform them as soon as possible
29/02/24, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Tadiwanashe!

So far would you like to ask anything?
29/02/24, 7:57 pm - +263 78 948 2963: Ma'am sorry l have to go the boarding master is coming cellphones are not allowed
29/02/24, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: We are done with the discussion for today please.
29/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
29/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
29/02/24, 8:09 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “01-03-23” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
