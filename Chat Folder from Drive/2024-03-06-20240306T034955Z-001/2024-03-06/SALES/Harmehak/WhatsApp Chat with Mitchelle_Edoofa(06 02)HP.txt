08/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 352 7166: Ok
08/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 352 7166: Thank you so much
08/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 352 7166: Woow what an experience
08/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 352 7166: Edoofa is an organisation which helps deserving students with life changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable Higher education as well as internship opportunities
08/02/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 352 7166: As it have limited seats intake and they are seeking the brightest students. Edoofa helps provide scholarship on the tuition fee and the quantum of the scholarship depends on the students performance in the interview with the program director as well as merit and academic background, statement of purpose, recommendation and extracurricular
08/02/24, 11:22 am - Harmehak: Very correct and well received, Trish and Mitchelle!

What all did you learn regarding the costs involved?
08/02/24, 11:38 am - +263 78 352 7166: Thank you so much
08/02/24, 11:41 am - +263 78 352 7166: This scholarship can only be earned on the basis of merit, talent and attitude. It helps reduce the costs and expenses of higher education in India. It is a 50% _100% scholarship on tuition fee.
08/02/24, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Received please!
08/02/24, 11:44 am - Harmehak: In simple words Mitchelle and Trish, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
08/02/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 352 7166: The eligible and enrolled students should be aware on the information that firstly the scholarship varies from 50%_100% on tuition fee and secondly costs and expenses after scholarship 2000 dollars _3000 dollars yearly
08/02/24, 11:47 am - +263 78 965 5629: Well  it offers 50- 100 percent on tuition fees and through edoofa instead of paying $6 000-$8 000 per year you will have a chance to get part of the$10 million fund.the fee reduces to $2 000-$3 000 per year
08/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Very correct!
08/02/24, 11:47 am - Harmehak: Did you follow the same as well?
08/02/24, 11:50 am - +263 78 965 5629: Not really
08/02/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
08/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 352 7166: l will work extra hard inorder to earn a high passing grade during my studies
08/02/24, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: We look forward to the same!

Did you manage to have a discussion with your parents regarding the program and finances involved?
08/02/24, 12:06 pm - +263 78 965 5629: We discussed with them so we are working hard to get the money
08/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: I understand please!

So are they willing to support you financially as well as mentally?
08/02/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 965 5629: They will support us mentally , financially we are independent
08/02/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: How are you planning your higher education by yourself from the financial aspect?
08/02/24, 12:27 pm - +263 78 352 7166: We are doing part time jobs and serving our money
08/02/24, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: I do understand!

However how will you manage once in India?
08/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 965 5629: I think we will serve extra that's why we are working overtime
08/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: While I get what you are sharing, Mitchelle!

Would you agree that you would require financial support from your parents for your education?
08/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Yes
08/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!

So I would appreciate if you both first discuss the same in detail with your parents and get back to me please!
08/02/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 352 7166: Ok
08/02/24, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
08/02/24, 1:17 pm - +263 78 352 7166: Honestly, my parents sadly have nothing to support us with so we are busy looking for destiny helpers and working extra hard to keep the money and operating to start a business to sustain ourselves
08/02/24, 1:19 pm - +263 78 352 7166: So buy now we are working to raise money and as we get a chance to India they will be the ones left to operate in the business and l guess that's how they will help us
08/02/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please!
08/02/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 352 7166: Thank you so much

29/02/24, 10:45 am - Harmehak: Bachelor's degree in Commerce can provide a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences. Actuarial Sciences is the study of mathematical and statistical methods for assessing risk in the insurance and financial industries. Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:

Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.

Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.

Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.

Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques. Actuaries can attend professional development events, participate in continuing education programs, and stay informed of industry news and trends.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field. Actuaries are expected to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the insurance and financial industries, and must continuously update their knowledge to stay relevant in the field.
29/02/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 352 7166: Ok, thank you so much

29/02/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Let me help you have a better clarity over here please.

Actuarial Science is not a bachelor's or master's course, rather it is a certification that a student can pursue alongside pursuing their Degree, so what over here I was briefing you about is that the course of Bachelor in Commerce has several specializations, you can specialize in Finance and Accounting starting from the second year of their course. 

Along with this degree you can pursue the certification of Actuarial Sciences itself.

29/02/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
29/02/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
29/02/24, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Alright Mitchelle, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
29/02/24, 11:54 am - +263 78 965 5629: I think  l will be one of the most of successful human resource manager and as edoofa enables students to be employable l think it will help me  with better skills , experience and to be well equipped in the industry
29/02/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 352 7166: l am glad to get this information l didnt have enough of it
29/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: I appreciate.
29/02/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: That is great Mitchelle, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
29/02/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Like l want an environment that fully prepares me for the out side (industry) world unfortunately lndia is one of them ,here in our country there are so many graduates how have nothing to do after completion of their graduation and they are not equipped to fit in the industry because of lack of knowledge
29/02/24, 12:04 pm - +263 78 965 5629: And lack of experience
29/02/24, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mr. Piyush- Head of Counseling were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
29/02/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 965 5629: That is very true
29/02/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you both understand and that you are making efforts for a promising future, Mitchelle.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

29/02/24, 12:24 pm - +263 78 965 5629: When we went for our esat test we were fortunate enough to be shown other African students who are in lndia and their views on lndian education and their testimonies convinced me that this is the right time and also a researched that lndia is now one of the successful countries after close to 200years of being under colonial rule so according to me the journey of being successful is not any easy one it requires  to be architectured by those who have already made it that's why I chose lndia
29/02/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that you already were able to connect to students and hear their testimonials yourself.

I equally appreciate your knowledge.

29/02/24, 12:31 pm - +263 78 965 5629: This is quite interesting thank you for sharing
29/02/24, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome,

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
29/02/24, 12:33 pm - +263 78 965 5629: No we are not
29/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
29/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/02/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 12:37 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Alrighty well received
29/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: In simple words , what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/02/24, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
29/02/24, 12:41 pm - +263 78 965 5629: So the$ 2000 -$3000 is total coverage yearly so how much do you pay per semester
29/02/24, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Before I address your question,

Did you follow the same, Mitchelle?
29/02/24, 12:44 pm - +263 78 965 5629: We  are about to but we haven't
29/02/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same, Mitchelle?
29/02/24, 12:54 pm - +263 78 965 5629: True so that is if you don't have an scholarship
29/02/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: I hope now you have a better clarity?
29/02/24, 12:58 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Thank you yes l understood
29/02/24, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1800, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $900 in the first semester and $900 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
29/02/24, 1:07 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Alrighty
29/02/24, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: If you compare this, with living and cost of education in Zimbabwe, 

1. UZ's fee for 2024 intake is $650-$750 a semester, meaning $1300-$1500 a year for tuition.
2. Cost of accommodation is around $80-$100 a month, meaning $1000-$1200 a year.
3. Cost of food, even if you consider a simple meal of sadza and chicken curry that costs $1, so $1 a meal and 3 meals a day that is $3 a day, which means almost $1200 a year.
4. Miscellaneous expenses such as travel, internet easily cost $40-$50 a month meaning $600 a year.

All in all cost of studying at locally in Zimbabwe is be around $4000-$4800 a year, isn't it, Mitchelle?
29/02/24, 1:09 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Yes it is
29/02/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: So are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/02/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Yes the earn while you learn program is able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to $3000  which covers their university expenses after that they are given opportunity to reduce  their remaining annual fee and if one is able to clear all criteria with a passing grade  ,the student would be eligible for higher quantum scholarship
29/02/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: While I would like to correct you!

The cost after the scholarship is $2000-3000.

Now if you get a higher quantum of scholarship instead then the costs would be $1200-1800.

While the same can be further reduced through the Earn While You Learn Program.
29/02/24, 1:28 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Alrighty thank you for that
29/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
29/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
29/02/24, 1:29 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

29/02/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 965 5629: I read it and understood
29/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: That's good
29/02/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/02/24, 1:51 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Alrighty so the credits are simply rewards you get after performing  the given tasks  from the earn while you learn program
29/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: Very correct.

The same amount you earn is basically reduced from your fee.
29/02/24, 1:53 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/02/24, 1:59 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Well this is excellent
29/02/24, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 2:01 pm - +263 78 965 5629: So it seems as though the program has a duration
29/02/24, 2:03 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Yes l now realize the difference
29/02/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Which duration are you referring to please?
29/02/24, 2:08 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Like does it have a time where it ends or it is active till the end of your academic journey
29/02/24, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: You would begin with your Earn While You Learn Program from Zimbabwe itself and it will continue till the end of your academic journey in India.
29/02/24, 2:11 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Alrighty l wasn't clear on that thank you
29/02/24, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
29/02/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
29/02/24, 2:15 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Yes
29/02/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: Mitchelle, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
29/02/24, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/02/24, 2:18 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Maybe close to $1500_$2250
29/02/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/02/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
29/02/24, 2:28 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Alrighty noted
29/02/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
29/02/24, 2:29 pm - +263 78 965 5629: Yes that is so true
29/02/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
29/02/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/02/24, 2:39 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
29/02/24, 2:43 pm - +263 78 965 5629: What if you fail to  pay within the given period will your acceptance letter still be valid
29/02/24, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: You proceed ahead for the further process after you are prepared.
29/02/24, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Once you receive an acceptance letter that is when you pay.
29/02/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
29/02/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/02/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
29/02/24, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
29/02/24, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: @263783527166 @263789655629
01/03/24, 8:17 am - +263 78 352 7166: Well understood
01/03/24, 9:32 am - +263 78 352 7166: . Morning
01/03/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 965 5629: Morning yes l did understand
04/03/24, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

Excuse me for not being able to connect with you on our scheduled time as I was facing some technical issues the past few days.

However I am here to continue, shall we start?
04/03/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 352 7166: Ok, we understand
04/03/24, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Did you both thoroughly follow our previous discussion?
04/03/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 352 7166: Yes we did
04/03/24, 10:08 am - Harmehak: Great, 

Trish so far would you like to ask anything?
04/03/24, 10:10 am - +263 78 352 7166: No, l have well understood what you have explained so far
04/03/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: I am glad to know that!
04/03/24, 10:12 am - +263 78 352 7166: Thank you
04/03/24, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/03/24, 10:13 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
04/03/24, 10:13 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

04/03/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
04/03/24, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

04/03/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
04/03/24, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow on “05-03-24” at 11:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable.

Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.
