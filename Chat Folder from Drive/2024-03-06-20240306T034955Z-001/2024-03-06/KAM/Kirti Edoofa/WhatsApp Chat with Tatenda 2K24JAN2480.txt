I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
6/2/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Oh ok 
Thank you
We can start
6/2/24, 1:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
6/2/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok noted
6/2/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
6/2/24, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
6/2/24, 1:53 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok noted
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
6/2/24, 1:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
6/2/24, 1:55 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok noted
6/2/24, 1:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
6/2/24, 1:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
6/2/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok noted
6/2/24, 1:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
6/2/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Yes we can
6/2/24, 1:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
6/2/24, 1:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
6/2/24, 2:00 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Yes we can start
6/2/24, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
6/2/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Yes I'm  ready
6/2/24, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the videos with you now

6/2/24, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
6/2/24, 2:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

6/2/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
6/2/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
6/2/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
6/2/24, 3:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

7/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 088 9015: *2* .*GIVE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT* 
To put it simply, entrepreneurship is the act of starting and running a business, while economic development refers to the process of improving the economic well-being of a community or region.Economic development can also be achieved through things like infrastructure development, education, and job creation. And it can be beneficial for everyone involved, from entrepreneurs to local governments to the broader population. 

 Here's a brief overview of the differences between entrepreneurship and economic development:

- Entrepreneurship is an individual pursuit that involves taking risks and seeking out opportunities to create a new business.
- Economic development is a broader, community-based process that involves multiple stakeholders working together to create an environment where businesses can thrive.
- Entrepreneurship typically focuses on creating value for a small group of people, while economic development aims to create value for a larger group, such as an entire region or country.

 Another key difference is that economic development tends to be a long-term, sustainable process, while entrepreneurship is often associated with more short-term gains. This is because economic development requires building infrastructure and systems that will benefit the community for years to come, while a new business may have a shorter lifespan or be more prone to failure. However, successful entrepreneurship can lead to long-term economic development, especially if the business is able to create jobs and opportunities for others.

Additionally, economic development often involves government intervention or support, while entrepreneurship is typically driven by individuals or small groups. The government may provide funding, tax incentives.

 Entrepreneurship often involves the creation of new products or services, while economic development focuses on improving existing systems and processes. For example, an entrepreneur might create a new app or business, while an economic development effort might focus on improving the local transportation system
7/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 088 9015: *3* *Please share your understanding of GAAP and it's importance* 
The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are important because they provide a standardized framework for financial reporting.This helps to ensure that financial statements are accurate and consistent across different organizations.  GAAP also promotes transparency and consistency in financial reporting, which is important for investors, creditors, and other stakeholders.  Without GAAP, financial reporting could be less reliable, and it would be more difficult to compare the financial performance of different companies.  In short, GAAP helps to promote trust and confidence in the financial markets.

 GAAP is a set of guidelines for financial reporting, and it's used by most companies in the U.S. These guidelines help ensure that companies are reporting their financial information accurately and consistently. Without GAAP, it would be much more difficult for investors, analysts, and other stakeholders to compare the financial health of different companies. GAAP is important because it promotes transparency and trust in the financial markets.

GAAP covers a wide range of topics, including revenue recognition, asset valuation.

 One of the key components of GAAP is the concept of accrual accounting. This is a way of recording revenues and expenses based on when they're earned or incurred, rather than when the cash is actually received or paid out. For example, a company might record a sale as soon as it's made, even if the customer doesn't pay until later. Accrual accounting is important because it gives a more accurate picture of a company's financial performance over time.

Another important concept in GAAP is the matching principle. This principle states that expenses should be matched with the revenues that they helped to generate.Some of the specific rules in GAAP, Starting with the revenue recognition principle. This principle states that revenue should be recognized when it's earned, rather than when the cash is received. For example, if a company provides a service in January but doesn't get paid until February, the revenue should be recognized in January, not February. This principle is important because it helps to ensure that companies are reporting their revenues accurately.

 The inventory valuation principle. This principle states that inventory should be valued at the lower of cost or market value. In other words, inventory should be
7/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 088 9015: *4* *What  are the accounting  standards  and why  are they mandatory* 
The accounting standards that make up GAAP are called the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) and the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The FAS standards are a set of general principles that cover a wide range of topics, including revenue recognition, inventory valuation, and financial statement presentation. The ASC standards are more specific and detailed, and they often replace or update the FAS standards.

Some examples of FAS standards include FAS 5, which covers revenue recognition; FAS 87, which covers pensions; and FAS 107, which covers derivatives. Some examples of ASC standards include ASC 606, which covers revenue recognition.


The accounting standards that make up GAAP are known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) standards. They're issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which is a private-sector, non-profit organization that sets the standards for financial reporting in the U.S. GAAP standards are considered mandatory because they're endorsed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Companies that are publicly traded or registered with the SEC are required to follow GAAP standards. Even private companies often choose to follow GAAP standards because they're widely respected and accepted.

Within GAAP, there are two main sets of standards: the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) and the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The FAS standards are more general, while the ASC standards are more specific and detailed. They cover topics like revenue recognition, inventory valuation, financial statement presentation, and many other aspects of financial reporting. The FAS standards are usually updated or replaced by the more specific ASC standards. For example, the old FAS 5 standard on revenue recognition was replaced by the more detailed ASC 606 standard.

One of the reasons that GAAP standards are considered mandatory is because they're designed to promote consistency and comparability in financial reporting. This means that companies can be compared to each other in a more fair and meaningful way. The standards also help to ensure that financial statements are transparent and understandable. They provide a common language and framework for financial reporting, which is important for investors, creditors, and other stakeholders. Without GAAP standards, it would be much more difficult to compare the financial performance of different companies.

Another reason that GAAP standards are mandatory is because they help to ensure that financial statements are reliable and free from fraud.
7/2/24, 1:37 PM - +263 78 088 9015: *5* *Please  differentiate between Accounting and Auditing*
 Accounting deals with recording financial statements whereas auditing deals with verifying and evaluating the accuracy of the transactions.
Accountants prepare financial statements whereas auditors verify the statements and ensure that they comply with accounting laws and regulations

 Accounting refers to the process of recording, classifying, and summarizing financial transactions and information. Auditing, on the other hand, is the process of verifying and evaluating the accuracy and reliability of the financial statements that have been prepared by the accounting process. So, accounting provides the data, and auditing provides the checks and balances.
The accounting process starts with the collection of financial data, like sales, purchases, and payroll. This data is then processed and analyzed to create a set of financial statements, like the income statement and balance sheet. Auditing, on the other hand, starts after the financial statements have been prepared. An independent auditor reviews and evaluates the accounting process and the resulting financial statements to make sure they are accurate and reliable. Auditing also includes testing the internal controls of the company to make sure they are effective.

Another important difference between accounting and auditing is that accounting is done by the company itself, while auditing is performed by an outside party. The company's accountants may prepare the financial statements, but they are then independently audited by an outside auditor. This separation helps to ensure the objectivity and integrity of the financial statements. Without an independent audit, there would be no way to verify that the financial statements are accurate and free from fraud.

 So the last key difference between accounting and auditing is that accounting is an ongoing process, while auditing is a periodic exercise. Accounting is performed on a regular basis to keep track of the company's financial situation. On the other hand, auditing is only performed once a year (or less frequently, depending on the company). The purpose of auditing is to verify the accuracy of the financial statements for a specific period of time.

7/2/24, 2:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
7/2/24, 2:31 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ohh ok
7/2/24, 2:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
7/2/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok
7/2/24, 2:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward. I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 29th February 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
7/2/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Yes my parents  are on it
7/2/24, 2:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
7/2/24, 2:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BCom for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
7/2/24, 2:37 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Yes  please  that's  right
7/2/24, 2:38 PM - +263 78 088 9015: It's alright  thank you
7/2/24, 2:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
7/2/24, 2:39 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Yes I'm  ready
7/2/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
7/2/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
7/2/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
7/2/24, 2:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
7/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok
7/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Noted
7/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Noted
7/2/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Yes
7/2/24, 2:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
7/2/24, 2:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
7/2/24, 2:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
7/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Noted
7/2/24, 2:48 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Yes he did
7/2/24, 2:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
7/2/24, 2:52 PM - +263 78 088 9015: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is *Ms Aditi*  and he/she has scheduled my session for *13 February  2024*".
7/2/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Yes l got that part
7/2/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi. I appreciate you sharing the session date with us. 

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
7/2/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
7/2/24, 2:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
7/2/24, 2:57 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Alright
Thank you
7/2/24, 2:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome @263780889015
7/2/24, 2:59 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok l got it
7/2/24, 3:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
7/2/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Oh ok
7/2/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 088 9015: So as of now we have to focus  on  the $1000
7/2/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please you are absolutely correct.
7/2/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
7/2/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
7/2/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
7/2/24, 3:05 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Alright
7/2/24, 3:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your acknowledgment of the above messages.
7/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok
7/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Noted
7/2/24, 3:06 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok noted
7/2/24, 3:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
7/2/24, 3:08 PM - +263 78 088 9015: I got it
7/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
7/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
7/2/24, 3:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok thank you
7/2/24, 3:12 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Noted
7/2/24, 3:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
7/2/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 088 9015: I'm so excited
7/2/24, 3:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
7/2/24, 3:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
7/2/24, 3:18 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok that's  relieving  because here  the financial burden is real
7/2/24, 3:19 PM - +263 78 088 9015: No I'm not aware
7/2/24, 3:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
7/2/24, 3:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
7/2/24, 3:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
7/2/24, 3:25 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Ok
7/2/24, 3:25 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Oh ok
7/2/24, 3:25 PM - +263 78 088 9015: I got it
7/2/24, 3:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process?

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

28/2/24, 4:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tatenda,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 4:40 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Good afternoon
28/2/24, 4:41 PM - +263 78 088 9015: I didn't  manage  to connect with anyone
28/2/24, 4:42 PM - +263 78 088 9015: I managed  to hear from  the CEO when  he was  sharing some of his experiences <This message was edited>
28/2/24, 4:43 PM - +263 78 088 9015: I also  heard from other  students who are travelling to  India in Aug <This message was edited>
29/2/24, 5:21 AM - +263 71 323 5876: Apologies for failing to attend your recent program in Zimbabwe. This was due to short notice which in turn could not allow me to make arrangements at my work place to be released. 
Thanks, thank you so much for the visit to Zimbabwe. I really appreciate and acknowledge the establishment of the relationship between your institution and my family especially your coming in to assist me in particular as Blessing's grandmother with just a superb educational program for my grand child. Your coming in to Zimbabwe relieved me on a number of issues which were not clear when Blessing introduced the program. The likes of scam and child trafficking you know among others. Thank you once more.
29/2/24, 1:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tatenda.

I hope you are doing well. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
29/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Good afternoon
29/2/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 088 9015: I'm not sure l just   know there was a lot of students
29/2/24, 2:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780889015 , there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piyush and the director of Edoofa. As per the records that I have, it seems as if you were not able to meet the team for a one on one? If I may ask, may I know if there is any particular reason because of which you were not able to meet the team personally?
29/2/24, 2:15 PM - +263 71 323 5876: Not exactly only heard from Tatenda that students came from  as far as Bulawayo and parents as well
29/2/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Currently  I'm  in the bank trying  to make a payment of my application fee
29/2/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and that is quite alright. These exclusive interactions have been instrumental in guiding students forward on their educational paths. Since you couldn't attend the seminar, I have personally arranged for you to have similar exclusive access over phone calls and I will share the details of the call with you tomorrow.
29/2/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, I am curious if you or your family members had any interactions with students or parents who attended the seminar? It would be enlightening for you to hear their perspectives and understand the overarching experience and benefits they gained from the event so that when you have your call with the team, you know exactly what you need to discuss for your education.
29/2/24, 2:29 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for keeping me posted.
29/2/24, 4:35 PM - +263 78 088 9015: It's alright
29/2/24, 4:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through my message above?
29/2/24, 4:37 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Yes l did just now
29/2/24, 6:14 PM - +263 71 323 5876: Unfortunately not yet as it is difficult to know who were there unless if there was a group with other parents so that we would ask for updates
29/2/24, 6:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's understandable. I will make arrangements for you to connect with seminar attendees and their parents tomorrow. Hearing firsthand experiences will provide valuable insights.
29/2/24, 6:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Additionally, I am sure you recall the highlight of our rendition of the industrial visit, SLICE-CON, showcasing how our Indian Edoofians are prepared for the professional world along with the recorded messages from these students specifically for you. What was the best part of the seminar for you and your family? What were you able to resonate with the most?
29/2/24, 10:26 PM - +263 78 088 9015: There's  a part l saw were the students  were excited  about meeting  up with the CEO's  of companies  l can't  recall  the names.Also getting to do their presentation  infront of CEO's.
29/2/24, 10:27 PM - +263 78 088 9015: I realised  that  Edoofa  is giving the  students some exposure  that is not given  everywhere
1/3/24, 3:57 AM - +263 71 323 5876: Thank you so much that will be great of you
1/3/24, 4:18 AM - +263 71 323 5876: Waal  thanks to Edoofa for inspiring these learners and assisting them realize their potential
1/3/24, 12:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tatenda.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing your views and indeed we not only want to students to have affordable education but we even want them to know how practical life works as well, and this can only be possible if they are introduced to exposure through education.
1/3/24, 12:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have a plethora of insights from the seminar to share with you, I recognize that we are already approaching March, with academic classes commencing in August. With this timeline in mind, I am keen to hear about your educational plans. Have you and your family been able to discuss your aspirations and next steps for your university education in the past couple of days?
1/3/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Good afternoon
1/3/24, 1:10 PM - +263 78 088 9015: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 1:12 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Mmm  for the past  days l been  communication with my parents abt the EWYL program that l was introduced to recently
1/3/24, 6:46 PM - +263 71 323 5876: Sure
1/3/24, 6:46 PM - +263 71 323 5876: We have been talking of meeting the deadline on payment of the $169 and just wish if by April and May manage to raise the other amounts highlighted earlier on
1/3/24, 6:46 PM - +263 71 323 5876: It's good to keep on having programs to take but EWLY  entails what
1/3/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tatenda.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the receipt for the remaining enrollment fee for the Edoofa program, it is duly noted with us.
1/3/24, 6:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see, and I appreciate your transparency. Educational planning requires careful consideration and wise decisions, areas where Edoofa has excelled over our 15-year journey. As Edoofa’s Parent Organization marks its 15th Anniversary on May 11th, our commitment to guiding students like yourself towards successful careers remains steadfast.
1/3/24, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Among the positive seminar experiences, we encountered some sobering realities as well. We met students from the 2021 batch who, due to financial constraints, were unable to pursue their education in India as initially planned. They enrolled in local universities such as Chinhoyi University, Bindura University, University of Zimbabwe, and Harare Institute of Technology. However, upon meeting us, they expressed dissatisfaction with their current educational experiences and uncertain prospects for employment, despite substantial financial investments.
1/3/24, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: These students revealed that they're paying $2400 at Chinhoyi University, $2600 at Bindura University, and $3200 at the University of Zimbabwe. Despite these hefty fees, they lack confidence in their future opportunities. This predicament underscores the importance of informed decision-making in education.
1/3/24, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I recall our last visit to Zimbabwe in May 2023, where the exchange rate was 1000 Bonds to 1 USD. Now, in just 10 months, it has skyrocketed to 18000 Bonds. This steep rise significantly has impacted students studying in Zimbabwe, increasing the challenges they face. Were you aware of this exchange rate?
1/3/24, 7:06 PM - +263 78 088 9015: You're welcome
1/3/24, 7:07 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Good evening  
Yes the rate is skyrocketing
1/3/24, 7:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see and as you're aware, Zimbabwe presents its own set of challenges. Our team experienced firsthand the elevated cost of living and network difficulties, which contribute to the demand of pursuing education abroad. 

Additionally, there was a concerning safety incident involving our female staff members in Harare when they were followed by two men at night. While incidents like these serve as sobering reminders, they also highlight the importance of exploring educational opportunities in more stable environments.

What are your thoughts on these challenges? Do you perceive them as common occurrences in Zimbabwe?
1/3/24, 7:17 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Yes the cost of living is actually stressful  here as prices for basic commodities  keep on going higher and higher
1/3/24, 7:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is quite unfortunate and I personally wish for you to take a step forward from your current situation and get access to better opportunities so in light of this, may I know how your preparation for your registration fee is going on?
1/3/24, 7:24 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Well yeah that's my parents dream for me to access better opportunities
1/3/24, 7:25 PM - +263 78 088 9015: As my grandmother  said earlier  they are working towards it and they  wish to manage to raise the money  buy April and May
1/3/24, 7:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, and it is good to know that you are preparing hard for your registration fee, once we get updates from the university we shall notify you till then I hope you have great day today and weekend ahead, feel free to reach out to me if you have any concerns to share with us.
1/3/24, 7:27 PM - +263 78 088 9015: Alright
Thank you have  a great weekend  ahead too
2/3/24, 3:07 AM - +263 71 323 5876: That's the main cause of our worry over Tatenda's educational endeavours  the rates are quite unrealistic there is so much craziness among people
2/3/24, 8:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well.

I completely understand that, and it is quite unfortunate, however, I am happy to see you are willing to steps for Tatenda's educational endeavors so that Tatenda is also not caught up in the same situation.
2/3/24, 12:13 PM - +263 71 323 5876: Fine thanks and hope you are fine as well. Sure, you can say that again
5/3/24, 6:20 PM - +263 71 323 5876: How are you good people
