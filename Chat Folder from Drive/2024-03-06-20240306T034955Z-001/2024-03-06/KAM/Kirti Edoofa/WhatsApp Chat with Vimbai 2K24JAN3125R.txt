16/2/24, 8:59 AM - +263 71 838 9027: <Media omitted>

16/2/24, 9:02 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

16/2/24, 9:06 AM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/2/24, 9:06 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Thank you so much madam so the date of the exam won't change?
16/2/24, 9:08 AM - Kirti Edoofa: It will be on the same date as mentioned in the poster.
16/2/24, 9:12 AM - +263 71 838 9027: I've analysed the cycle madam
16/2/24, 9:13 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
16/2/24, 9:13 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
16/2/24, 9:16 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I'm seeing them
16/2/24, 9:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
16/2/24, 9:17 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
16/2/24, 9:19 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I'm following
16/2/24, 9:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/2/24, 9:20 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
16/2/24, 9:22 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes , very clear Ms Kirti
16/2/24, 9:23 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
16/2/24, 9:28 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes , let's proceed
16/2/24, 9:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
16/2/24, 9:31 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
16/2/24, 9:34 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes
16/2/24, 9:34 AM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
16/2/24, 9:34 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I'm ready
16/2/24, 9:54 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the videos with you now.
16/2/24, 9:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

16/2/24, 9:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
16/2/24, 9:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
16/2/24, 9:55 AM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

19/2/24, 9:37 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I got through the videos madam
19/2/24, 9:37 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, please share your understanding of the 4 videos.
19/2/24, 9:46 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok ,on the first video I learnt about the students who did the EWYL program and earned scholarship credits .and how they benefited from the program
The second one tells us about how the Edoofa program is different from the rest, it tells us that universities under Edoofa benefit a lot because they will get employed after graduating from the university.
The third one talks about universities and colleges.it tells us about great experiences from the university and colleges and how students are interacting
The fourth one is about the statement of purpose, it clears all the doubt of the parents as it explains all about the scholarship attachment to the universities and colleges.
19/2/24, 9:46 AM - +263 71 838 9027: That is what I understand from the videos
19/2/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
19/2/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
19/2/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
19/2/24, 9:47 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
19/2/24, 9:49 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Thank you so much for the further explanation, I thoroughly understood
19/2/24, 9:51 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/2/24, 9:51 AM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes we are on the same page
19/2/24, 9:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
19/2/24, 9:53 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

4. An example from my life which shows my managerial talent or skill is when I was a prefect at school. I was able to manage that time that other students in my class were supposed to be in class . I was able to make sure that the  classroom was tidy before and after school .Also , I'm the first born in a family of 3 children. So I am able to manage and see how my siblings are participating at school and assisting them on doing house chore . Some times my parents my leave the house to attend business meetings or family gatherings . I will be the one to manage the security and the day to day occasions at home.

20/2/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
I hope you are doing well,

I have an urgent family emergency because of this I will not be able to continue the sessions for the next few days.

I will drop a message in the group as soon as I am available. 

*Be assured that your admissions process will not be hampered, and I will commence the same on priority once I come back*
20/2/24, 4:07 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok madam.
22/2/24, 12:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Vimbai.

I trust you are in good health. I apologize for not reaching out earlier, as my family is currently facing a challenging situation with the passing of my grandfather. I have been occupied with the necessary rituals and, as a result, was unable to connect with you.
22/2/24, 3:33 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok madam , good afternoon madam ..sorry I was out of bundle
22/2/24, 3:34 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Sorry for the loss...
22/2/24, 3:34 PM - +263 71 838 9027: I hope all the rituals went well
22/2/24, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, it went well.
22/2/24, 3:44 PM - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are available to connect with us?
22/2/24, 4:00 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I'm available
22/2/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
22/2/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BBA for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake? <This message was edited>
22/2/24, 5:06 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes , that's true madam
22/2/24, 6:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Before we move ahead, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 09-Mar-2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
22/2/24, 6:06 PM - +263 77 336 0698: Yes that one is on me as the father...and is going to be paid before the due date
22/2/24, 6:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
22/2/24, 6:20 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes ...I'm ready
22/2/24, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
22/2/24, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
22/2/24, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
22/2/24, 6:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/2/24, 6:25 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes it's impossible
22/2/24, 6:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/2/24, 6:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/2/24, 6:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/2/24, 6:40 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes , very correct
22/2/24, 6:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
22/2/24, 6:57 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes we are
22/2/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
22/2/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum
22/2/24, 6:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*

Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
22/2/24, 7:00 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I have
22/2/24, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650. This amount can be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
22/2/24, 7:19 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok , I understand
22/2/24, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
22/2/24, 7:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
22/2/24, 7:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
22/2/24, 7:24 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok , I understand..
22/2/24, 7:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/2/24, 7:29 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes may u please clarify on that .
22/2/24, 7:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The average flight cost will be $400-$500 and the visa fee is $83 which is a one-time investment.
22/2/24, 7:42 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok ...I do understand
22/2/24, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
22/2/24, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
22/2/24, 7:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
22/2/24, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 7:47 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes that's true ...I will be glad to receive my offer letter and I've seen the picture and it seems to.be a gray moment upon arrival to India
22/2/24, 7:47 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Great*
22/2/24, 7:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes indeed. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
22/2/24, 8:47 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I'm excited please share the news
22/2/24, 8:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
22/2/24, 8:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
22/2/24, 8:58 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I'm aware
22/2/24, 8:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
22/2/24, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
22/2/24, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 28, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 28, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 28, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
22/2/24, 9:01 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I'm following
22/2/24, 9:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
22/2/24, 9:13 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I'm excited
22/2/24, 9:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
22/2/24, 9:15 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Ok thank you madam.... Have a good night

28/2/24, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Vimbai,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Even before the team returned to India, we were already eagerly planning our next visit, spurred on by the incredible connections and opportunities we secured for the students of Zimbabwe.
28/2/24, 4:12 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 7:17 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Thank you for sharing with us the good experience you had with us , We also had a great and educational time having you.We also learnt a lot by chatting with you physically. We got the chance to interact with Mr Jyotishman. We got a lot of thorough information about the Edoofa scholarship program. We also wrote the ESAT which has got the pending results.
29/2/24, 1:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Vimbai.

I hope you are doing well. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
29/2/24, 3:04 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes
29/2/24, 3:04 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Afternoon to you too ma'am
29/2/24, 4:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you were able to go through the message above?
29/2/24, 4:48 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I was able to read it
29/2/24, 4:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. There were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jyotishman, and Mr. Piiyush. If I am correct, you were one of the fortunate students and were able to interact with Mr. Austin to discuss the way forward for your education. How was your discussion?
29/2/24, 4:59 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Yes I discussed with Mr Jyotishman.
29/2/24, 5:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear. In line with this, I have a wealth of insights from the seminar to share with you. However, considering that we're already approaching March, with academic classes beginning in August, I'm eager to hear about your key takeaways from the seminar. This will help us tailor our discussion towards your university admission journey. What aspects of the seminar resonated with you the most?
29/2/24, 5:01 PM - +263 71 838 9027: Our discussion was very informative. We understood more about the Edoofa program. We were able to meet face to face with the Edoofa team .
29/2/24, 5:09 PM - +263 71 838 9027: The key take aways where about the fees deduction. When one passes the ESAT the fees will be deducted and we also learnt about the slicecon.
29/2/24, 6:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, with line to that, may I know how is your preparation regarding the registration fee is going on?
