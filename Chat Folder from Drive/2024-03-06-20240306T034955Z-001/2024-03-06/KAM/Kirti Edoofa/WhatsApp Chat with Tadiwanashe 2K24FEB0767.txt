This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
1/3/24, 7:24 PM - +263 78 988 8134: I am ready ma'am we can start the discussion
1/3/24, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
1/3/24, 7:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
1/3/24, 7:27 PM - +263 78 988 8134: I am through with the image ma'am
1/3/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
1/3/24, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
1/3/24, 7:45 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Clear ma'am
1/3/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
1/3/24, 7:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
1/3/24, 7:49 PM - +263 78 988 8134: I am following ma'am but on this stage l have a question so it means that if l get selected by over 5 universities l might get an opportunity to choose the one of my choice
1/3/24, 7:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263789888134 Yes you are absolutely correct.
1/3/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
1/3/24, 7:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well? <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 7:58 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Okay ma'am

1/3/24, 8:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
1/3/24, 8:49 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes we can ma'am
1/3/24, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
1/3/24, 8:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

2/3/24, 10:01 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Good morning everyone hope l find you all well

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing fine. May I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
2/3/24, 10:05 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Great to hear that you are doing well ma'am .yes l have managed to go through the videos ma'am
2/3/24, 10:11 AM - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to know so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
2/3/24, 10:15 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Okay ma'am let me share with you some of my understanding
2/3/24, 10:17 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Actually looking to the videos that have been sent by ms kirti l have seen that the cofounders of the Edoofa schoolarships program are trying to explain more accurately on the aspects of the Edoofa program for example in one of the above videos there is an aspect of vision where they are fighting so much harder to enable the great archievement of students educational qualifications at most as there is an aspect of helping the student to be educated at a lower expense through the help of the scholarship percentage as one can also be able to get a fully funded schoolarships at the same time participating in EWYL program which will help to make students financially independent to sponsor their education
2/3/24, 10:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
2/3/24, 10:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
2/3/24, 10:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
2/3/24, 10:21 AM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
2/3/24, 10:26 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Also l would like to add an aspect of the type of institution that works in hand with the Edoofa program as alluded in one of the video where the founders are giving a clear explaination of why they choose the Universities that they work with .one of the reasons being because of the universities educational pass rates as they look forward to create a comfortable and beneficial learning area to their proud Edoofians as the two have given an example that it is of no return to put their student on a non essential and unprofitable environment in terms of education as it may result in them being weakened
2/3/24, 10:29 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Understood ma'am now the understanding is expanding
2/3/24, 10:29 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of NAME’S university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in NAME’S admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
2/3/24, 10:30 AM - +263 78 988 8134: Yes ma'am we are on the same page ma'am
2/3/24, 10:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday at 01:30 PM.
2/3/24, 10:32 AM - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously may I know if you were able to complete the tasks by now?
4/3/24, 1:36 PM - +263 78 988 8134: I am okay ma'am yes l did managed to finish the task ma'am
4/3/24, 1:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, please share the tasks with us here.
4/3/24, 1:38 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Okay ma'am let me forward them to you
4/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Question 2. Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference between Human Rights and Civil Rights.

Answer
Rights can be defined as one's claims which are essential for the development of his or her own self and that are recognized by society or the state for example right to life , right to Education etc whereas Duties can be defined as something that one is expected or required to do for example one is expected to be patriotic and also to keep his or her surroundings clean to mention a few. Rights and duties also differ in the sense that rights have some certain restrictions as there are some factors like the law of label n slander, state of emergency, censorship etc while duties have no restrictions as the more one performs his duties, the more the state's benefits. 

Human Rights are those rights which one acquires by being alive whereas Civil Rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state. Furthermore, human Rights are the rights one have simply for being a human being for example right to food, right to health and right to protection and security etc while civil rights are contextual, meaning one is entitled to specific civil rights through being a citizen of a particular country. Also civil rights are proclaimed by the government for the citizens of the country while human rights are derived from natural law and are universally protected and applied. Thus, it is clear that Human Rights and Civil Rights have their own differences.
4/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Question 3. What is the difference between prosecutor and an attorney. 

Answer : A prosecutor is a legal officer who will either represent the federal or state  government during a legal proceeding where there are criminal charges whereas an attorney is an individual who acts on behalf of another as an agent or deputy. Also a prosecutor is responsible for prosecuting the crime that the accused are being tried for while the attorney will do the opposite as they should work to provide enough evidence to defend their client who has been accused to defend their client who has been accused of criminal charges. 

Furthermore, a prosecutor and an attorney also differs in their goals. This is because a prosecutor works with an aim to charge the accused with specific crime or multiple crimes that they have been accused of commuting as they show beyond a reasonable doubt that a client is guilty whereas an attorney works to defend their clients against criminal charges as the client will always be considered innocent until proven guilty. 

In conclusion, the above summerises on the differences of a prosecutor and an attorney as these two differ in their goals and also in whom they stand for in court.
4/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Question 4. Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Cooperate or Criminal and why?

Answer : I am most interested in pursuing Criminal law. This is because studying criminal law and justice can lead to various professional prospects by providing a comprehensive understanding of the legal system, criminal behavior and societal issues that influences crime. Also criminal law enables one to develop an aspect of critical thinking as one could think out of the box to defend a case and also one can get the knowledge on the legal consequences of crimes commited. 

Moreover, criminal law is also beneficial in the sense that it offers job stability as it is so essential to our society due to crimes being committed day by day. Also criminal law has an advantage in the sense that it opens a lot of doors for the career market afterwards and it is always something that will continue to have an open platform of employment Availability in future. 

Lastly, l am also interested in pursuing criminal law because being a criminal defense can bring some personal benefits as these are the benefits that encompass anything that promises to improve one's life for example career path of course.
4/3/24, 1:40 PM - +263 78 988 8134: Question 5. What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with examples. 

Answer : I believe l have good communication skills and this can help me become a successful lawyer. This is because most lawyers benefit from good verbal and written communication skills to succeed as they must have for example strong oral communication skills, strong interpersonal skills which they will use when interacting with their clients, supervisors, teammates etc in doing their research. Therefore this goes inline with my skill of having good communication skills as l bacame successful in interacting with my teammates in Highschool thus my belief in my communication skills can make me a successful lawyer. 

Furthermore, l also believe l pay too much attention to details thereby this can make me a successful lawyer. This is because l give my whole attention to a discussion whenever there is one and this is an essential skill for any aspiring lawyer because it may help lawyers detect inconsistencies, missing information and even inaccuracies in legal papers. Thus l believe this skill can make me a successful lawyer.
