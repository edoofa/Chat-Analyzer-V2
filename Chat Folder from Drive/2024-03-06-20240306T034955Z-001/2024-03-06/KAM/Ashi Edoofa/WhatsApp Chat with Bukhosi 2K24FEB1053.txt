1/3/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
1/3/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
1/3/24, 4:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

1/3/24, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
1/3/24, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?

1/3/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
1/3/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
1/3/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?

1/3/24, 4:13 PM - +263 77 289 8718: How much are we paying for smooth visa process, another 500 to 1000usd
1/3/24, 4:16 PM - +263 77 772 7249: Are they two payments?

1/3/24, 5:11 PM - +263 77 772 7249: Sorry the transport we are using is about to leave. Is possible that we continue on monday. Where we going we have poor network connectivity.
1/3/24, 6:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect on Monday at 12:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
2/3/24, 10:15 AM - +263 77 289 8718: Thanks so much
2/3/24, 10:17 AM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 12:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bukhosi, I hope you had a good weekend! 

I wanted to follow up regarding the videos that were shared with you yesterday. Were you able to review all four of them? I am keen to discuss them further and would greatly appreciate your feedback.
4/3/24, 12:33 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Good day. Our weekend was well spent
4/3/24, 12:37 PM - +263 77 935 8444: Afternoon how are you. Yes we where able to review all four of them and what we deduced from them was very enlightening on how the Edoofa scholarship program operates without any form of scams
4/3/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
4/3/24, 1:12 PM - +263 77 935 8444: what I understood is that from one of the videos the two important qualities of a successful Edoofian who have secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits is that they should be open minded and should be able to listen to each and every instruction
4/3/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts @263779358444, @263772898718 Would you like to share your insights with us ?
4/3/24, 1:26 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Edoofa programme appears to be transparent
4/3/24, 1:28 PM - +263 77 935 8444: Edoofa scholarship program seems to be laying out each and every detail clearly no matter how small or big the issue might be. Which is really good. <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
4/3/24, 1:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
4/3/24, 1:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
4/3/24, 1:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
4/3/24, 1:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
4/3/24, 1:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
4/3/24, 1:42 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Yes we do
4/3/24, 1:47 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Agreed
4/3/24, 1:51 PM - +263 77 935 8444: Yes I agree with it all this.And also  yes I was able to understand those four videos
4/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
4/3/24, 1:58 PM - +263 77 935 8444: yes we are still on the same stage you can proceed please
4/3/24, 2:02 PM - +263 77 289 8718: We can proceed
4/3/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
4/3/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

4/3/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
4/3/24, 2:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
4/3/24, 2:07 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay maybe by tomorrow might be able to complete it today it's difficult  because our network is fluctuating
4/3/24, 2:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day ahead and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
4/3/24, 2:37 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Thanks so much
5/3/24, 12:21 PM - +263 77 935 8444: Afternoon hope you are all well. I will now share my answers for the questions asked above
5/3/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 935 8444: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 12:22 PM - +263 77 935 8444: 2.Microorganisms are invisible to the naked eye.  Different types of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, and protozoa. Each  microorganisms has unique characteristics that distinguishe them from each another.
 
Bacteria (Escherichia coli) are single-celled organisms  found in various environments, including soil, water, and the human body. Some bacteria contribute in digestion and harmful in causing diseases and infections.
 
Viruses (Ebolavirus) are tiny infectious agents that require a host cell to replicate. They can cause a range of illnesses, from the common cold to more severe diseases like HIV and Ebola.
 
Fungi (Agaricus) are multicellular organisms that are found in soil, plants, and animals. They play important roles in decomposition and nutrient cycling, but some types of fungi can also cause infections in humans.
 
Algae (Brown algae) are photosynthetic organisms that can be found in aquatic environments. They are important for oxygen production and are a food source for many aquatic animals.
 
Protozoa (Amoeba) are single-celled organisms that can be found in soil, water, and the bodies of plants and animals. They are  parasitic or free-living, and play important roles in nutrient cycling and ecosystem dynamics.
 
Overall, each type of microorganism has its own unique characteristics and roles in the environment.
5/3/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 935 8444: 3.Bacteria are diverse microorganisms that can be classified into different groups based on various characteristics of bacteria is based on their shape, which includes cocci(spherical), bacilli (rod-shaped), and spirilla ( spiral -shaped) bacteria

When it comes to staining bacteria for identification purposes, one commonly used technique is the Gram staining method. This method involves applying a series of dyes to the bacterial cells, which helps differentiate bacteria into two main groups: Gram-positive and Gram-negative.

In Gram-positive bacteria, the thick peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall retains the crystal violet stain, giving them a purple color. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have a thinner peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane that can be penetrated by the counterstain, safranin,   giving them a pink color.

The part of the bacteria that actually gets stained during the Gram staining process is the cell wall. The properties of the cell wall, including it's thickness and composition, determine how the bacteria will react to the staining process and how they will appear under the microscope. This staining technique is essential in identifying and classifying different types of bacteria based on their structural characteristics

5/3/24, 12:23 PM - +263 77 935 8444: 4.The human body is made up of many cells. A cell is the smallest basic unit of a body responsible for all the body functions. They perform various functions to maintain our health and well-being. Some key cells include red blood cells, white blood cells, nerve blood cells, muscle cells and skin cells.
 
White blood cells, also known as leukocytes are a crucial component of our immune system. They play a vital role in defending the body against infections and diseases. Different types of white blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. Neutrophils are the first responders to infection and help engulf and destroy pathogens, while lymphocytes produce antibodies to target specific pathogens.
 
When diseases invade the body, white blood cells are mobilized to fight off the infection. However, some diseases can affect the function of white blood cells, leading to compromised immunity. For instance, HIV targets and destroys a specific type of white blood cell called CD4 T cells, weakening the immune response and making the body susceptible to infections. Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, can also disrupt the immune system by causing it to attack healthy cells and tissues. Infections, cancer and other medical conditions can also impact the production and function of white blood cells, affecting our body's ability to fight diseases.
5/3/24, 12:24 PM - +263 77 935 8444: 5.Medical practitioners often prescribe antibiotics to patients with viral infections due to a variety of reasons, even though antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections. One primary reason for this practice is the difficulty in distinguishing between viral and bacterial infections based on symptoms, such as fever, cough, and sore throat, making it challenging for healthcare providers to accurately diagnose the underlying cause without further testing.

Additional, in some cases, patients with viral infections may develop secondary bacterial infections as a complication. By prescribing antibiotics early on, healthcare providers aim to prevent or treat these secondary bacterial infections, which can be more severe and lead to complications if left untreated.

Furthermore, prescribing antibiotics for viral infections can sometime be a precautionary measure to address the possibility of a bacterial superinfection, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems or underlying heath conditions.

However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics can contribute to antibiotics resistance, a global health threat where bacteria becomes resistant to the effects of antibiotics. Therefore, it is crucial for medical practitioners to exercise caution and use antibiotics judiciously, ensuring they are prescribed only when necessary and effective for bacteria infections.
5/3/24, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Bukhosi, Wishing you a wonderful day!

Thank you for sharing your response for the academic questions, May I know if you have completed the SOP form as well ?
5/3/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 935 8444: yes I have completed it
5/3/24, 12:52 PM - +263 77 935 8444: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
5/3/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (08-Mar-2024).
5/3/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/JRZxEIG8hRVK8Ms1U0VdrM
5/3/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

5/3/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
5/3/24, 12:58 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay let me get to that
5/3/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear,  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
5/3/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 19th March 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
5/3/24, 1:02 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Yeah we are preparing as parents for Bukhosi's studies
5/3/24, 1:06 PM - +263 77 935 8444: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is ___Ms Tushti____ and she has scheduled my session for ___08 March 2:30pm_____*(mention the date)
5/3/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Tushti. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
5/3/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
5/3/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Microbiology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
5/3/24, 1:17 PM - +263 77 935 8444: thank you very much for your guidance so far
5/3/24, 1:18 PM - +263 77 772 7249: Greetings. I am following the discussions
5/3/24, 1:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welocme @263779358444
5/3/24, 1:19 PM - +263 77 935 8444: it's B.Sc Hons (Microbiology) and yes am planning to come during that time
5/3/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
5/3/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
5/3/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
5/3/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
5/3/24, 1:30 PM - +263 77 935 8444: yah am aware of that
5/3/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
5/3/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
5/3/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
5/3/24, 1:33 PM - +263 77 935 8444: yes we discussed it with the counselor
5/3/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
5/3/24, 1:35 PM - +263 77 935 8444: yes we're following
5/3/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
5/3/24, 1:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
5/3/24, 1:44 PM - +263 77 935 8444: yes it's noted
5/3/24, 1:45 PM - +263 77 289 8718: How we know the tuition fees and accommodation before scholarship?
5/3/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263772898718 Please note that the above fees break is just an example not the actual cost of education.
5/3/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
5/3/24, 1:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
5/3/24, 1:50 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay noted
5/3/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
5/3/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
5/3/24, 1:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
5/3/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay am following
5/3/24, 2:23 PM - +263 77 289 8718: It's quite clear
5/3/24, 2:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education? <This message was edited>
5/3/24, 2:28 PM - +263 77 289 8718: My question is the admission to Edoofa program fee we will pay is not linked to registration fees to universities?
5/3/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263772898718 The enrollment fees of $350 is for the enrollment in Edoofa Scholarship Program. For the registration fees you will be required to pay the amount when you will receive the offer letter. I hope that's clear ?
5/3/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Clarified
5/3/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
5/3/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
5/3/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
5/3/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
5/3/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 935 8444: This looks wonderful indeed
5/3/24, 2:51 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Quite exciting indeed
5/3/24, 2:57 PM - +263 77 935 8444: okay noted
5/3/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
5/3/24, 3:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
5/3/24, 3:04 PM - +263 77 935 8444: yes am really excited to know
5/3/24, 3:06 PM - +263 77 289 8718: Would be glad if the sentiments shared will be accomplished
5/3/24, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once.
5/3/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, We agrees with you
5/3/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
5/3/24, 3:08 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
5/3/24, 3:10 PM - +263 77 935 8444: no we are not aware of the solution
5/3/24, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
5/3/24, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
5/3/24, 3:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for March 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before March 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by April 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
5/3/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 772 7249: Thank you for the highlight. One time l heard there were around 150 students that enrolled at Lovely Proffessional  University  under Edoofa, where Edoofa had promised to assist them. When they were  India, they didnt get the assistance and were forced to return to Zimbabwe. Could you assist me on this perception
5/3/24, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263777727249, May I kindly know gave you this information as this scenario has never happened ?
5/3/24, 3:31 PM - +263 77 772 7249: Its a message that circulated some time by that time l didnt even know about Edoofa and it was meaningless to me by that time
5/3/24, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am afraid to see that you have been following the wrong information here as all the students who have enrolled in the program are enjoying their education journey in India.
5/3/24, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are anticipating Bukhosi to come this year in India and start new journey
5/3/24, 3:33 PM - +263 77 289 8718: OK hopefully it was wrong information
5/3/24, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please
5/3/24, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
5/3/24, 3:35 PM - +263 77 772 7249: Thanks. you have cleared the wrong perception
5/3/24, 3:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome, I am always here to assist your doubts and queries
