I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
24/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam we can start
24/1/24, 7:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/1/24, 7:23 PM - +263 71 257 4969: I have gone through it and I also understood
24/1/24, 7:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
24/1/24, 7:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
24/1/24, 7:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
24/1/24, 7:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
24/1/24, 7:25 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam
24/1/24, 7:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
24/1/24, 7:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
24/1/24, 7:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
24/1/24, 7:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
24/1/24, 7:30 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam I'm following and understanding it as well
24/1/24, 7:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
24/1/24, 7:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
24/1/24, 7:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
24/1/24, 7:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
24/1/24, 7:35 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam they're all clear
24/1/24, 7:38 PM - +263 71 257 4969: So mam in this case I am at stage 5 right
24/1/24, 7:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No my dear, we will start these stage today.
24/1/24, 7:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

24/1/24, 7:39 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam
24/1/24, 7:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
24/1/24, 7:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?

25/1/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I wanted to follow up regarding the videos that were shared with you yesterday. Were you able to review all four of them? I am keen to discuss them further and would greatly appreciate your feedback.

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
25/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 71 257 4969: from the videos I understood that we as students should be understanding as well as open minded and also to follow instructions given to us by the Edoofians and that we should also be resourceful and deligent
25/1/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Is there anything else you would like to share ?
25/1/24, 1:10 PM - +263 71 257 4969: No mam
25/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
25/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
25/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
25/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
25/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
25/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
25/1/24, 1:13 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam I have understood
25/1/24, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant! Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
25/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam we are in the same page
25/1/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
25/1/24, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

25/1/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/1/24, 1:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
25/1/24, 1:25 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Okay mam so do I have to submit all the forms tomorrow
25/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear, May I know by when you will be able to submit them ?
25/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 71 257 4969: I will be able to submit them by the given time mam
25/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
25/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Okay mam thank you

26/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Thank you mam
26/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Qsn1.Give a brief introduction, highlighting your skills with an example
26/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 71 257 4969: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Qsn2.Please elaborate on the difference between rights and duties and give a further explanation of the difference in human rights and civil rights

Rights are those privileges and benefits a person enjoys as a citizen of a state while duties are the responsibilities which citizens are expected to carry out in return for the rights they enjoy.Also rights are limited by certain factors such as state of emergency, censorship etc while duties have no restrictions the more one performs his duties,the more the state's benefits.Rights are duties of government of the citizens.The government is bound to protect the rights of citizens while duties are responsibilities of citizens to the state.Human rights are the rights you have simply for being a human being comparatively civil rights are contextual meaning you are entitled to specific civil rights through being a citizen of a particular state.While civil rights are often granted by a government ,human rights are considered to be universal and can not be taken away and also civil rights are often restricted to certain groups while human rights are applicable to all human beings regardless their identity
26/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Qsn3.What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney 

A prosecutor is a government official who represents the state of federal government in criminal cases,they seek to enforce the laws finding justice through charging and successfully prosecuting the person accused of a crime.An attorney on the other hand can represent both the government and private individuals in both criminal and civil cases.A prosecutor's primary goal is to seek justice by convicting criminals they may work closely with members of law enforcement and criminal justice employees to gather evidence and enforce legal actions whereas an attorney's goal may be to defend their client and seek the best possible outcome for them even if that means they are not convicted they handle appeals from clients that are found guilty by the jury and help them receive shorter sentences .In addition a prosecutor follow strict ethical guidelines whereas an attorney may have more flexibility in their approach
26/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Qsn4.Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing Civil, Corporate or Criminal and why

I want to pursue in corporate law as studying corporate law exposes me to a variety of legal areas to ensure a well rounded legal knowledge and I also love analytical thinking and corporative team environments.Corporate law lends itself well to those skills while providing collaborative atmosphere.I choose this branch of law because it can give insights into goals and aspirations and there are also a number of opportunities that comes along with it.One of the biggest opportunities is the ability to help grow and expand it also provides guidance on how to set up a business as well as to finance it thus I want to pursue in corporate law as I value financial stability and job security in my career and the law provide this as well as being a fascinating field that offers endless complex problems to solve and demands a wide variety of skills which I believe I have
26/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Qsn5.What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer please elaborate with an example 

As l have highlighted  above l have been  enrolled in a debate  club since my primary school level.This helped me to grow , develop and become a great problem  solver in other word a solution handler. As l grew up l have always had a second thought about every move , step and l have wanted to know the 3 most important questions  why , when ,how and who in all aspects of life .This inquisitive  character  has made develop some good leadership qualities  both in primary and secondary education  levels .

26/1/24, 1:08 PM - +263 71 257 4969: That's for my interview questions mam
26/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
26/1/24, 1:16 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Okay mam
26/1/24, 1:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 22nd February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
26/1/24, 1:20 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam my family and I are aware the remaining fee will be  paid before the 22nd of February
26/1/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
26/1/24, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
26/1/24, 1:26 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam it is accurate
26/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
26/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
26/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
26/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
26/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam
26/1/24, 1:33 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Okay mam I understand
26/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
26/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
26/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
26/1/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Okay mam
26/1/24, 1:43 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam we discussed about it
26/1/24, 1:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
26/1/24, 1:47 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam we are on the same page <This message was edited>
26/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
26/1/24, 1:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
26/1/24, 1:51 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam I have taken note of it and it's affordable
26/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
26/1/24, 1:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
26/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Okay mam
26/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/1/24, 1:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
26/1/24, 2:02 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Noted
26/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 71 257 4969: I don't have any queries mam I have understood everything
26/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
26/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
26/1/24, 2:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam I can't wait to also be a member of this prestigious Program
26/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed dear. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
26/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
26/1/24, 2:37 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes please
26/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
26/1/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
26/1/24, 3:08 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam
26/1/24, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
26/1/24, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/1/24, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29 , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/1/24, 3:22 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes I have followed and understood it with this it will give  my family a little bit of to arrange the money
26/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear, Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/1/24, 3:24 PM - +263 71 257 4969: No mam you have explained it in a way that I and my family will understand
26/1/24, 3:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263712574969. are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 71 257 4969: Yes mam I'm really excited for this
