For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 3:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok i am done
18/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
18/1/24, 3:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/1/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
18/1/24, 3:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
18/1/24, 3:11 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
18/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
18/1/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
18/1/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
18/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i am
18/1/24, 3:46 PM - +263 78 697 8729: I understand
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
18/1/24, 3:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
18/1/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Am i going to pay this registration fee while in Zimbabwe or when i am in India?
18/1/24, 3:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786978729 You will be paying the registration fees when you are Zimbabwe as the university will be reserving your seat for scholarship although this will be needed when you will receive your offer letter
18/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 78 697 8729: <Media omitted>
18/1/24, 4:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand that the registration fees will be needed at the time of your registration at the university. However, for Edoofian students, this will not be an additional cost, as the registration fees will be adjusted in your tuition fees upon your arrival in India. I hope this clarifies your doubt ?
18/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am now i get it
18/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Sorry ma'am i am lost a bit like the registration will be covered by the scholarship and then when i arrive i should cover it ,is that so
18/1/24, 4:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, The scholarship covers your total cost of education which also includes your Registration fees, although you know the student who have applied for the admission at the university with Edoofa Scholarship they have to pay the registration fees and the complete tuition fees which means for them the registration fees is an additional cost. Please don't worry as we will have a detailed discussion about the same in our upcoming session
18/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am so we can proceed
18/1/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/1/24, 4:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding until you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

18/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear,  In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.

18/1/24, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome!
19/1/24, 10:18 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Good morning Ms Ashi.

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
19/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok.Students must be open minded and teachable which means they should follow all the instructions from Edoofa.Edoofa forcused on increasing students capacity for success, however  it is making quality education affordable.In choice of universities as Edoofa took more than a decade of years to identify good schools so Students must follow instructions to be qualified for prestigious institutions.
19/1/24, 10:51 AM - +263 78 697 8729: As for the last one i did not understand
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/1/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/1/24, 11:07 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes now i get it but can i know how this SOP works
19/1/24, 11:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries please, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/1/24, 11:17 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes please
19/1/24, 11:28 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
19/1/24, 11:29 AM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

19/1/24, 10:22 PM - +263 78 697 8729: <Media omitted>
20/1/24, 5:19 AM - +263 78 697 8729: 2.Rights are those privileges and benefits a person enjoys as a citizen of a state while Duties are the responsibilities which citizens are expected to carry .To add on with an example of right to education where as it is a duty to educate 

Human rights are rights one acquires by being alive whilst Civil rights are rights that one obtains by being legal member of a certain political state .Civil rights are granted by the government while human rights are rights that are derived from natural law.In human rights we have the right to food while in civil rights we have to vote.

However ,Both human rihghts and civil rigths protect us against discrimination   ,injustice and inequality.They are  close linked for instance if you denied a fair trial by independent counsil some Human right you are also denied your right in many countries.

3.An Attorney is a lawyer who stand on behalf of others in legal matters especially those who are accused whereas a prosecutor is a lawyer who tries to prove in court that the person is guilty.

4.Criminal Lawyer ,because i want to advocate on behalf of those accused of criminal activity and ensures that their liberties and basic rights are fairly upheld with the justice system.To add on,  i like criminal law because i want to be in court mostly and my save my family in legal matters.

I think i am through
20/1/24, 8:48 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Liberty, Wishing you a good day!

Thank you for sharing your response with us regarding the SOP form and academic questions. I have taken a note of them and will update them in our data. In order to move ahead with your journey, May I kindly know if you are available for the discussion ahead ?
20/1/24, 9:13 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am we can proceed
20/1/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
20/1/24, 9:14 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
20/1/24, 9:19 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am i think by the end of this month i am going to complete
20/1/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
20/1/24, 9:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/1/24, 9:32 AM - +263 78 697 8729: You are welcome and thank you as well
20/1/24, 9:34 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes you are right
20/1/24, 9:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
20/1/24, 9:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/1/24, 9:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/1/24, 9:39 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/1/24, 9:47 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
20/1/24, 9:49 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Whait if they find me ineligible for the course i applied for
20/1/24, 10:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Please don't worry as you have been this course because you are eligible for the same.
20/1/24, 10:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/1/24, 10:02 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/1/24, 10:02 AM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/1/24, 10:05 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok noted
20/1/24, 10:08 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am
20/1/24, 10:26 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/1/24, 10:28 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i am following ma'am
20/1/24, 10:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
20/1/24, 10:33 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
20/1/24, 10:43 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Sorry as the registration fee need to be paid within two weeks ,as an Edoofian i am suppose to pay it when?
20/1/24, 10:46 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786978729 The deadline date for the registration fees will be shared with you when you will receive your offer letter from the university officials. I hope you understand ?
20/1/24, 10:47 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i understand
20/1/24, 10:51 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
20/1/24, 10:52 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
20/1/24, 10:59 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok sorry Ms Ashi i think i am lost somewhere
20/1/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, Please go ahead if you have any doubt
20/1/24, 11:02 AM - +263 78 697 8729: The example you gave me is it after the scholarship?
20/1/24, 11:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, The tuition fees range shared with you which is $1200 to $1800 per year from $6000 to $8000 per year. The reduce in the amount is after scholarship, I am sure your counselor must have explained this as well, right ?
20/1/24, 11:11 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes she explained but i want to know is that the registration fee is not going to be covered by Edoofa?
20/1/24, 11:16 AM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786978729 The registration fees are paid by the students only as the university will reserve your scholarship seat. However, For the edoofians, this registration fee is zero as once they paid the registration fees, the amount will be adjusted in their tuition fees. 

For a better understanding, If the registration fee is $1000 and the cost of education is $1650. Ideally, The student has to pay the amount of $2650. However, as you can edoofian you have an advantage here. I hope that's clear now.
20/1/24, 11:22 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok so which means as Edoofians we are not going to pay the registration until we arrive on India?
20/1/24, 11:41 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me correct you here that the registration fees will be paid while you are in your country as you need to reserve your seat for the scholarship. Once you will complete the registration procedure, the amount you have paid will be shifted to your first year tuition fees.
20/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am i get i better so when do the offer letters will be out ,like the estimate dates
20/1/24, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786978729 I will address this question with you soon at the end of our discussion. For now, can we continue with our discussion?
20/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am yes we can
20/1/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/1/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
20/1/24, 12:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/1/24, 12:39 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok noted please
20/1/24, 12:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 78 697 8729: No we can proceed
20/1/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/1/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
20/1/24, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

20/1/24, 12:52 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am this is the most exciting part we i would like to hear
20/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
20/1/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Liberty. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/1/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
20/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok
20/1/24, 1:06 PM - +263 78 697 8729: We are together
20/1/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
20/1/24, 1:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
20/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 78 697 8729: No ma'am i want to know it
20/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
20/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 25, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 25, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am but i know it is going to be hard for my family as they earn money in early April but we are going try to complete it
20/1/24, 1:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are putting your 100% efforts here for your education. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 78 697 8729: No i get it clear
20/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
20/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, With this, we can proceed to step 4 of the admission cycle, i.e., Offer Letter from University/College. The universities will take three to five days to evaluate your application, after which, if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, the scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee will be mentioned. <This message was edited>
20/1/24, 1:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On this note, let us conclude our conversation for today. I had a very good time interacting with you, Liberty. I will reach out to you once we get an update from the universities. Wish you a blessed day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family as well.

1/3/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
1/3/24, 12:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)

1/3/24, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it? <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
1/3/24, 12:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
1/3/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
1/3/24, 12:54 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am
1/3/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
1/3/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
1/3/24, 1:01 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok so i want to know about the payment plan .
1/3/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, I will be assisting with the same soon. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
1/3/24, 1:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
1/3/24, 1:14 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes clear ma'am
1/3/24, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
1/3/24, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
1/3/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
1/3/24, 1:26 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok as they are a little busy but they will reply as soon as possible
1/3/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
1/3/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees.
1/3/24, 1:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
1/3/24, 1:33 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
1/3/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as March 14th, 2024*.
1/3/24, 1:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion, I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
1/3/24, 1:45 PM - +263 78 697 8729: So ma'am i want to know about the due dates of this payment
1/3/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
1/3/24, 1:49 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am so now i am beseeching you to regmquest for an adjustments of dates to 20 March
1/3/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Let me share the payment plan with you, the registration fees of $1000 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $500 before the first deadline date of *March 14th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $500 before the second deadline date of *April 14th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
1/3/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $1000 within 15 working days, before March 14th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
1/3/24, 2:44 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes please
1/3/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
1/3/24, 2:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
1/3/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 697 8729: In Bindura but i am close to Harare
1/3/24, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare.
1/3/24, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 11% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. Here are the account details:

Account Name: Rajan Nayer
Name of Bank: FBC
Card Number: 5333 0380 2715 7004
Swift Code: FBCPZWHA
Sort Code: 8127
1/3/24, 3:00 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok
1/3/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Can you help on this one
1/3/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
1/3/24, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know why you want to postpone the date to 20th of March ?
1/3/24, 3:38 PM - +263 78 697 8729: That is when i am expecting my money receive my fee to be sent ma'am
1/3/24, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, however these deadline are shared by the university officials and hence its important to make the payment with in a deadline date please
1/3/24, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you understand ?
1/3/24, 5:08 PM - +263 78 256 5698: Yes I can see that the program is advantageous
2/3/24, 11:01 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Liberty, I hope you are doing well!
2/3/24, 11:02 AM - +263 78 697 8729: I  am doing great ma'am how are you?
2/3/24, 11:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am doing well thank you for asking
2/3/24, 11:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we continue our yesterday discussion ?
2/3/24, 11:03 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes we can
2/3/24, 11:06 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, As I have shared Mr. Rajan contact with you. Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference? <This message was edited>
2/3/24, 11:09 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am .So you mean it is wise to use Mr Nayer's account?
2/3/24, 11:09 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, I will recommend you to use Mr. Rajan as the charges are less there
2/3/24, 11:10 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
2/3/24, 11:11 AM - +263 78 697 8729: We can proceed
2/3/24, 11:13 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -

2/3/24, 11:23 AM - +263 78 697 8729: It is beautiful

This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday at 12:00 pm.

2/3/24, 11:26 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Yes ma'am
2/3/24, 11:27 AM - Ashi Edoofa: On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed weekend ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
2/3/24, 11:30 AM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am  thank you.
Have a blessed weekend as well💥
2/3/24, 11:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you
2/3/24, 11:31 AM - +263 78 697 8729: You are welcome
4/3/24, 12:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Liberty!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?
4/3/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Afternoon  how are you ma'am?
Yes we discussed.
4/3/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine thank you for asking <This message was edited>
4/3/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
4/3/24, 2:33 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am firstly i appreciate the scholarship % that Edoofa gave me .I can see my dream became successful.As we were calculating  the total funds that are needed i realize the accessibility and affordability of higher Education in India .As we were discussing ,we did not understand on the uniform and medical insurance as it seems like you did not add it  on the total figure you shared with me .Can you help us with clarity .
4/3/24, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your doubt with me, I would like to share that we have shared the total cost of education with you in our earlier session where it was mentioned that your total cost of education will be in the range of $1200 to $1800 and as per the offer letter shared by the university the total cost of education is $1600 which comes under the same range right ?
4/3/24, 2:48 PM - +263 78 697 8729: <Media omitted>
4/3/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Maybe i add it of which it is not needed during the first year
4/3/24, 3:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with me dear, I appreciate that. Let me share that the unviersity has gone a extra step for the safety of their student. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $40 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
4/3/24, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Coming back to the concern dear, Yes the cost of uniform fee and medical insurance is not added in the total cost of education
4/3/24, 3:21 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok clear
4/3/24, 3:23 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok so when it is needed
4/3/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263786978729 You need to pay the registration fees now and rest of the amount will be needed in the month of August, you also have the opportunity to pay the amount in installment right ?
4/3/24, 4:13 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Ok ma'am so if i pay $1000 i need to know the balance for preparations
4/3/24, 5:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Absolutely dear, After paying the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850 and $90 for uniform fees and medical insurance. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1940 - $1,000 = $940 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
5/3/24, 11:03 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Liberty, I hope you are doing well!
5/3/24, 11:04 AM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
5/3/24, 4:33 PM - +263 78 697 8729: Sorry ma'am let's continue tomorrow
5/3/24, 5:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Have a good day ahead!
