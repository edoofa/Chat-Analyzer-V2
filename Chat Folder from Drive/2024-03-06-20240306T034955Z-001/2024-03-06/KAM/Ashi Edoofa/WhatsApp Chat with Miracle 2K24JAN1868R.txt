30/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
30/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders.

30/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
30/1/24, 7:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.

31/1/24, 1:54 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Yes ma'am it's impossible to study at multiple universities rather I agree one has to have one desired university.
31/1/24, 1:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
31/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
31/1/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
31/1/24, 1:57 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Okay I understand
31/1/24, 1:58 PM - +263 78 101 2373: How long does it take to make a decision
31/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
31/1/24, 1:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263781012373 We will guide you regarding the same
31/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Yes my counselor discussed this matter with me
31/1/24, 1:59 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Okay thank you
31/1/24, 2:01 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Yes we are on the same page
31/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum*
31/1/24, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $2800). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
31/1/24, 2:06 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Mmmmm .... okay
31/1/24, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
31/1/24, 2:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
31/1/24, 2:07 PM - +263 78 101 2373: This part am totally clear
31/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
31/1/24, 2:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
31/1/24, 2:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
31/1/24, 2:12 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Actually am trying to digest this whole thing.....


So you are saying per year its$2800 right.....so my registration fee for example $1000 and the remaining is $1800 right
31/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 101 2373: My question is am actually paying for the whole year....?? I hope you understand what am trying to say
31/1/24, 2:13 PM - +263 78 101 2373: How many semeters are there
31/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I wanted to take a moment to clarify the fees breakdown for you. The example provided is based on our experience over the past few years, and it is meant to give you an idea of the costs involved. Please note that the total cost of education is $2800 per year, and this includes two semesters. <This message was edited>
31/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding your question about the registration fees, please know that this is a one-time fee of $1000 that will be adjusted in your first-year tuition fees. For instance, if you pay the registration amount of $1000, your tuition fees for the first year will be $1800, which can be paid in monthly installments.
31/1/24, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please rest assured that we are here to help you every step of the way. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
31/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Alright ... So registration and tuition are way different aspects....the the $1800 will be divided into 2 that is $900
31/1/24, 2:23 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Alright l understand better
31/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Ok
31/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Hello Admission Officer,l am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor.The name of my mentor is Ms Aditi and she has scheduled my session for 06 February.
31/1/24, 2:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear

31/1/24, 2:41 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Hopefully l will add value to the Edoofian family.
31/1/24, 2:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see your enthusiasm dear, Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
31/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 78 101 2373: No queries for now ....but if l have any l will make to ask as soon as possible
31/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
31/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
31/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
31/1/24, 2:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/1/24, 2:53 PM - +263 78 101 2373: We are really curious , anxious and excited.....about this
31/1/24, 2:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

31/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 101 2373: This is great work Ms Ashi ....keep on working hard and be blessed.
31/1/24, 2:56 PM - +263 78 101 2373: 💪💯l really salute your dedication🫡
31/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Am excited and curious as well .....what is the news please be kind to share
1/2/24, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Miracle, I hope you are doing well!
1/2/24, 12:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not continuing with our discussion yesterday, Although I am excited to continue with our session today. Are you ready for the session ?
1/2/24, 12:39 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Afternoon ma'am....am doing great ,hope you are having a good day.
1/2/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 101 2373: I'm excited to hear your news .I know you were probably busy,but  I'm looking forward to finding out what you have to say
1/2/24, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear, After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
1/2/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Am totally ready for the session
1/2/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
1/2/24, 12:43 PM - +263 78 101 2373: No am not
1/2/24, 12:49 PM - +263 78 210 9147: Good afternoon mam Ashi. I am well. Accept my apology for connecting late. Network is also a challenge today . However, am glad to hear that you are making effort to reduce burden related to registration fees in the 500 to 1000 range
1/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No problem
1/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
1/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
1/2/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for February 15, 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before February 15, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by March 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
1/2/24, 1:00 PM - +263 78 101 2373: This a great development and congratulations on that.....this is a great change from 2 weeks to 45 days
1/2/24, 1:02 PM - +263 78 101 2373: I have taken note of them and l have nothing to inquire..... maybe my parents are still to analyze and follow up as well
1/2/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear,Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
1/2/24, 1:08 PM - +263 78 101 2373: No queries so far ....
1/2/24, 1:08 PM - +263 78 101 2373: We can move on
1/2/24, 1:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
1/2/24, 1:11 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Am truly excited for everything especially the offer letter and acceptance letter as well
1/2/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Even before the team returned to India, we were already eagerly planning our next visit, spurred on by the incredible connections and opportunities we secured for the students of Zimbabwe.
28/2/24, 10:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before I get into our experiences and the opportunities that were provided to you and your family, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to you for being a part of the event and contributing to its success. 

I am also eager to hear about your experience at the meet and greet session. Whom were you able to connect with, and how do you envision your educational journey progressing from here?
28/2/24, 12:05 PM - +263 78 101 2373: Greetings Ms Ashi


The meet and greet was not just any event but a special insight for me and other fellow students and of course dear parents to learn more about Edoofa . Personally,l got to learn more about Edoofa through the session with Mr Angad,the founder.He shared a few videos about the Slice Con event and also how other students are living in India.Moreover, getting to meet Ms Vilsha under Mr Piyush recommendation gave an eye opening to some of the situations that needed to be addressed.I learned a lot from the program and l hope you will continue to prepare for such events in the near future.
Well l envision my educational journey as a successful one full of guidance, support, hard work, consistency and of course facing new challenges that will help me grow.
28/2/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing such a heartful feedback with us, I am extremely happy to know about your thoughts. It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?

If I am correct, you were one of the fortunate students and were able to interact with Ms. Vilsha to discuss the way forward for your education. How was your discussion?
28/2/24, 2:19 PM - +263 78 101 2373: The discussion was educational and ways to move forward since it was all about my offer letter.
