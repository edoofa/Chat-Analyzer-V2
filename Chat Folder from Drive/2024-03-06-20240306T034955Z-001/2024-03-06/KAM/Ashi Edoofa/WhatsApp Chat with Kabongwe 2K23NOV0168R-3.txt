27/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
27/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/12/23, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/12/23, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
27/12/23, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
27/12/23, 3:38 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes I'm following.

27/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/12/23, 3:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

Hence, can you let me know at what time will you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?

27/12/23, 7:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263787146734
27/12/23, 10:33 PM - +263 78 714 6734: What i got from this video is that, one has to be open minded, open to trying everything possible to get where you want, seeking help to realize your potential as well as being able to listen and follow instructions without dail which will result in smooth sailing thoughout the journey.
27/12/23, 10:36 PM - +263 78 714 6734: My summary from this video is that, despite having the EWYL program which is designed for better employability, the industry is always changing and growing Edoofa's vision is to help students adapt to the industry and increase chances of success of the student. 
One students has to choose for themselves where they are headed to and use to the maximum the opportunity they're offered
27/12/23, 10:52 PM - +263 78 714 6734: What i understood from this video, is that Edoofa had to investigate the school they can work with to send students to and guarantee good education at affordable prices for students. Also students will have the opportunity to interact with the schools. Things like infrastructure, education quality, education medium where all vetted and for suitable with the universities registered ander Edoofa
27/12/23, 10:58 PM - +263 78 714 6734: My summary from this is the importance of the SOP. The SOP is the one chance that a student gets to stand out and maximize the scholarship they will get, as a students get to display themselves and their potential. It is important to not have unnecessary delays in this stagey

28/12/23, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @263787146734, In the meantime, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
28/12/23, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
28/12/23, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
28/12/23, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
28/12/23, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
28/12/23, 12:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
28/12/23, 12:40 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes i agree and understand
28/12/23, 12:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
28/12/23, 12:53 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, we are on the same page
28/12/23, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
28/12/23, 12:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
28/12/23, 1:08 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Understood
28/12/23, 1:09 PM - +263 78 714 6734: May i fill in the form in the evening and reconnect at 7pm as I'm currently traveling and have no access to the internet.

I hope by then you will be able to share the remaining forms and SOP form.
28/12/23, 1:17 PM - +263 78 714 6734: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:17 PM - +263 78 714 6734: <Media omitted>

28/12/23, 8:37 PM - +263 78 714 6734: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 8:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Job @263787146734

28/12/23, 8:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, dear
29/12/23, 1:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kabongwe, Wishing you a good day!

In regards to our conversation yesterday, I would like to know if you are ready for today's discussion, I am looking forward to connect with you today. On the same note, Could you please share your response with us?
29/12/23, 1:10 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Good day, yes I'm ready
29/12/23, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (5-Jan-2024).
29/12/23, 1:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/BcMEwD0Dctq3wD9dYPKVv8
29/12/23, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Kabongwe K Sibanda, and my EWYL group name is Kabongwe EWYL23E0954. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (5-Jan-2024) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
29/12/23, 1:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
29/12/23, 1:15 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Correct
29/12/23, 1:17 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Understood
29/12/23, 1:18 PM - +263 78 714 6734: I have sent the message, awaiting a response
29/12/23, 1:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *M.Sc. (Biotechnology)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
29/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes it is correct
29/12/23, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263787146734,  As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
29/12/23, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
29/12/23, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
29/12/23, 1:25 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/12/23, 1:32 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, thats right
29/12/23, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
29/12/23, 1:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
29/12/23, 1:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
29/12/23, 1:35 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes correct. May i know the implications of failing to pay the registration within the given time frame
29/12/23, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263787146734 I will assist you regarding your query soon please.
29/12/23, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
29/12/23, 1:41 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, I'm following
29/12/23, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
29/12/23, 1:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
29/12/23, 1:58 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes I'm following. 
May i know if the scholarship allocation will be put in the breakdown?
29/12/23, 2:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263787146734 Dear the above fees break up is the example please, however the scholarship percentage will be decided by the university please.
29/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
29/12/23, 2:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
29/12/23, 2:53 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Ok i understand
29/12/23, 2:54 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Ok ok i understand
29/12/23, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
29/12/23, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
29/12/23, 2:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
29/12/23, 3:01 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Please correct me if I'm not getting this correctly, i start the Earn While You Learn projects after completion of the registration fee?
29/12/23, 3:03 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Also may i understand, say i pay the registration fee, is it possible that the remaining fees be paid by the EWYL credit points?
29/12/23, 3:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your query with me, I would like to share that we have already connected you with your EWYL mentor, you will soon start the projects and earn scholarship credits. Additionally, Yes you can pay the tuition fees with scholarship credits dear.
29/12/23, 3:12 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Ok ok thank i understand
29/12/23, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 3:26 PM - +263 78 714 6734: No, I'm understand just the pending question i asked before, that are there any implications should i fail to pay registration on time? Can there be an extension to pay?
29/12/23, 3:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share that for the registration fees we have a flexible payment plan which will be shared with you soon. Shall we proceed ahead?
29/12/23, 3:41 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, we can proceed
29/12/23, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/12/23, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/12/23, 3:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/12/23, 3:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:49 PM - +263 78 714 6734: We are excited to receive offers
29/12/23, 3:50 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Thank you
29/12/23, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263787146734 .

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.

29/12/23, 4:36 PM - +263 78 714 6734: I have reviewed them, may you help explain point 3 .
29/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
29/12/23, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
29/12/23, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
29/12/23, 4:52 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Understood
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 4:56 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, i does
29/12/23, 4:56 PM - +263 78 714 6734: It
29/12/23, 4:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
29/12/23, 4:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 5:03 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, it does
29/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
29/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/12/23, 5:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
29/12/23, 5:05 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes I'm following
29/12/23, 5:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 5:07 PM - +263 78 714 6734: So far i have no questions about the process.
29/12/23, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So,  are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
29/12/23, 5:10 PM - +263 78 714 6734: May i know, by saying that, 37  seat have been secured this month, are seats reserved every month such that, should i fail this month i have an opportunity next month?
29/12/23, 5:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, For every student there is only one chance to secure their seat at the university. At the moment, 37 students have secured their seat <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 5:14 PM - +263 78 714 6734: 63, you had said 37, doe this mean its now critical securing seats

29/12/23, 5:25 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Its ok, please go ahead

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
29/12/23, 5:31 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Thank you, may i know to how many universities do i get to apply to? Also if they have global accreditation?
29/12/23, 5:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263787146734, All the universities which are associated with the Edoofa are globally recognized universities. We will apply at multiple university dear, based on the eligibility check

22/2/24, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you already know, we recently had a Meet and Greet Seminar in Harare, interacting with our students and their parents, and it was heartening to see them leave with smiles on their faces. I would like to share a few glimpses of the seminar with you, which demonstrates how enthusiastic and engaged our students were!

22/2/24, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/2/24, 12:39 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Please do
22/2/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 714 6734: They seem quite excited
22/2/24, 12:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed, we would like to see you with them as well
22/2/24, 12:41 PM - +263 78 714 6734: It would be a lovely idea
22/2/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear, Since you have received the offer letter. I would like to discuss it with you. Are you available for the discussion ?
22/2/24, 12:42 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes
22/2/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
22/2/24, 12:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
22/2/24, 12:44 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes we can
22/2/24, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
22/2/24, 12:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
22/2/24, 12:50 PM - +263 78 714 6734: 1. $900
2. 2 years
3. $300
4. $750
22/2/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a two-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 4 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
22/2/24, 12:51 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes
22/2/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
22/2/24, 12:52 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes
22/2/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2250 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2750 and this includes the food cost as well.
22/2/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
22/2/24, 12:53 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Ok understood
22/2/24, 12:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
22/2/24, 12:56 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yess
22/2/24, 12:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
22/2/24, 3:15 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes its clear
22/2/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
22/2/24, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on February 29th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
22/2/24, 3:19 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes we are?
22/2/24, 3:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
22/2/24, 3:20 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes
22/2/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of 29th February, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of 29th March, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
22/2/24, 3:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *February 29th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
22/2/24, 3:23 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes.
22/2/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/2/24, 3:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/2/24, 3:25 PM - +263 78 714 6734: No, i am not residing in Harare. I'm residing in Plumtree
22/2/24, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/2/24, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/2/24, 3:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/2/24, 3:29 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Thank you.
22/2/24, 3:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
22/2/24, 3:29 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Ok
22/2/24, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
22/2/24, 3:30 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes
22/2/24, 3:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo <This message was edited>
22/2/24, 3:36 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Thank you
22/2/24, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome, Moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
22/2/24, 3:39 PM - +263 78 714 6734: I thought tuition fee had a 50% scholarship
22/2/24, 3:39 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Don't worry, i understand
22/2/24, 3:40 PM - +263 78 714 6734: May i know if this is the only university applied to or the only university where i got admission?
22/2/24, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
22/2/24, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
22/2/24, 3:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I will be assisting you regarding the same soon
22/2/24, 3:42 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes
22/2/24, 3:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
22/2/24, 3:48 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes
22/2/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
22/2/24, 3:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to inquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
22/2/24, 3:51 PM - +263 78 714 6734: May i know if this is the only university applied to or the only university where i got admission?
22/2/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
22/2/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
22/2/24, 3:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
22/2/24, 3:52 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes i am clear.
22/2/24, 3:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
22/2/24, 3:54 PM - +263 78 714 6734: No I'm not aware
23/2/24, 11:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @263787146734, I hope you find this message in good health!
23/2/24, 11:20 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
23/2/24, 11:21 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
23/2/24, 12:40 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes i understand
23/2/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263787146734
23/2/24, 2:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know what are your plans ahead ?
27/2/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kabongwe, I hope you are doing well!
27/2/24, 4:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In regards to our previous discussion, I would like to connect with you today to understand your plans ahead. May I know if you are available ?
29/2/24, 2:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kabongwe,

We at Edoofa are filled with energy and excitement which has been fueled by the successful meet and greet sessions we hosted at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. 

The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. Before I get into our experiences and the opportunities we were able to secure for our students, I wanted to check in and see if you were able to attend the seminar?
29/2/24, 7:10 PM - +263 78 714 6734: Not, i wasn't
1/3/24, 8:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263787146734, I hope you are doing well!
1/3/24, 8:30 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's perfectly understandable that you were not able to come in the event. I appreciate your candor, and I understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances prevent us from attending events. If I may ask, were there any particular challenges that hindered your ability to join us in Harare?
1/3/24, 10:42 AM - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, the first issue was the finances where lacking, also my niece we stay with was unwell ee had to be up and down at the hospitals
1/3/24, 11:00 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That's understandable dear, It's heartening to see how each student's journey unfolds, and our conversation today reaffirms the progress we've made as an organization with our students. Do you know how many students and parents attended the seminar over just three days?
1/3/24, 11:10 AM - +263 78 714 6734: No, i dont have an idea
1/3/24, 12:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, there were over 2700 attendees and out of these 2,700 attendees, our team had the privilege of engaging in 30-minute one-on-one sessions with 487 students, including Mr. Austin, Ms. Vilsha, Mr. Abhinav, Mr. Jytoishman, and Mr. Piyiush and the directors of Edoofa.
1/3/24, 12:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: These exclusive interactions have been instrumental in guiding students forward on their educational paths. Since you couldn't attend the seminar, I have personally arranged for you to have similar exclusive access over phone calls and I will share the details of the call with you tomorrow.
1/3/24, 12:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, I am curious if you or your family members had any interactions with students or parents who attended the seminar? It would be enlightening for you to hear their perspectives and understand the overarching experience and benefits they gained from the event so that when you have your call with the team, you know exactly what you need to discuss for your education.
1/3/24, 12:28 PM - +263 78 714 6734: I have reached out to a few i heard they went, they're still yet to share their experiences
1/3/24, 6:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear I would like to share some pictures with you of the event so that you can share it with your family and friends. I am sure you must be excited to see them as well, right ?
