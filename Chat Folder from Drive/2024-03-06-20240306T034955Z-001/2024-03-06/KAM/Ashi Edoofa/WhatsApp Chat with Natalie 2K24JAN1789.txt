If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

26/1/24, 4:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/1/24, 4:01 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Am done ma'am
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
26/1/24, 4:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
26/1/24, 4:04 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes they are
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
26/1/24, 4:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
26/1/24, 4:06 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes I am ma'am
26/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
26/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
26/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
26/1/24, 4:08 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes they are
26/1/24, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am
26/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
26/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 71 416 7312: By end of today because my network connection is poor lately so it's taking long to download
26/1/24, 4:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and I am looking forward to getting an update from your end. I would also like to reiterate that our operational hours are from 12:30 PM to 8:30 PM, Central African Time.
26/1/24, 4:22 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.

27/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Good afternoon ma'am
27/1/24, 12:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In regards to the videos we have shared with you, you have shared your understanding with us. I would like to add some insight to them. May I know if you are available ?
27/1/24, 12:29 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes am available ma'am
27/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263714167312. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
27/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/1/24, 12:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am
27/1/24, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
27/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes we are ma'am
27/1/24, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday at 12:30 PM.
27/1/24, 12:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

29/1/24, 9:21 AM - +263 71 416 7312: <Media omitted>

29/1/24, 9:39 AM - +263 71 416 7312: Question 2

29/1/24, 9:50 AM - +263 71 416 7312: Question 3

GAAP ( Generally accepted accounting principles) is a collection of commonly followed accounting rules and standards for financial reporting . GAAP was formed in 1970 with 4 major rules and standards. The main purpose of GAAP is to ensure that financial reporting is transparent and consistent from one public organization to another and from one accounting period to another . It also enhances quick and accurate cross company comparisons through comparison of financial statements issued by GAAP complaint entities and safely assume consistency. 
The 4 principles of GAAP :
1) COST PRINCIPLE- it states that all listed values are accurate and reflect only actual costs rather than any market value of cost items

2) Revenue principle - refers to the requirement that when revenue is recognized it is reported

3) Matching principle - it describes the process of reporting expenses incurred form methods of revenue production

4) Disclosure principle -- Lt entails that companies declare necessary information when reports on financial status
29/1/24, 9:59 AM - +263 71 416 7312: Question 4

Accounting standards is a common set of principles, standards and procedures that define the basis of financial accounting policies and practices. They apply to the full breadth of an entity's financial picture including assets , liabilities, revenue expenses and shareholders equity. Banks , investors count on accounting standards to ensure information about a given entity is relevant and accurate.

29/1/24, 10:06 AM - +263 71 416 7312: Question 5

Accounting is the continuous process of managing and maintaining financial records whereas auditing is a periodic process that validates the accuracy of financial statements. The primary difference between accounting and auditing is their aim but other important differences exist as well . These differences include : 

1) Documentation -- Auditing typically only covers final financial statements while accounting involves developing and current financial transactions

2) Accounts --- In accounting , accountants create financial accounts for business and work with accounts in progress at every stage of development whilst in auditing , auditors only work with final accounts 

3) Reporting ---- In accounting , accountants report to their employers or clients whereas in auditing , auditors submit their audit report to shareholders or legal entities

4) Scope --- Accounting has broader financial activities whereas auditing is focused on financial statements

In conclusion , accounting and auditing deliver related benefits in different ways and both roles are vital to risk management , increased transparency and data driven decision making
29/1/24, 12:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Natalie , Wishing you a good day!
29/1/24, 12:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. May I know if you are ready for today's discussion ?
29/1/24, 12:28 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes I am ma'am
29/1/24, 12:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 23rd February, 2024. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and try to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
29/1/24, 12:32 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes we have Ma'am
29/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We will reconnect with each other a few days before your due date to take a follow up on this and understand your preparations better.
29/1/24, 12:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BCom* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
29/1/24, 12:33 PM - +263 71 416 7312: It is correct ma'am
29/1/24, 12:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation dear. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
29/1/24, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
29/1/24, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
29/1/24, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/1/24, 12:35 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes am sure
29/1/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
29/1/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
29/1/24, 12:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
29/1/24, 12:44 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am
29/1/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
29/1/24, 12:48 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am I am
29/1/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

1. *Tuition Fee*: $650 per annum
2. *Accommodation Fee*: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
3. *Remaining Fee Components*: [Library Fee, Examination Fee, EDB and Book Bank, International Student Development Fund, 24-Hour WiFi Cost, Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill]: $1000 per annum

*Total Fee: Tuition Fee $650 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Remaining Fee Components $1000 = $1650 per annum.*
29/1/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Registration Fee to be paid: $1000 (deadline within two weeks of issue of the offer letter, part of the university’s first-year fee and will be adjusted against the first-year cost of education $1650). I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
29/1/24, 12:51 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am
29/1/24, 12:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1650 as per the above example.
29/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1650 - $1000 = $650 . This amount can be paid in two installments of $325 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $325 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
29/1/24, 12:54 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Okay ma'am
29/1/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
29/1/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
29/1/24, 12:56 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
29/1/24, 12:59 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Understood ma'am
29/1/24, 12:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/1/24, 1:00 PM - +263 71 416 7312: No ma'am
29/1/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Now with this, we are done with step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/1/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
29/1/24, 1:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/1/24, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/1/24, 1:07 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Understood ma'am thank you
29/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
29/1/24, 1:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received special news for the students of the 2024 admission intake. May I know if you are excited to know the news we have for you?
29/1/24, 1:15 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Am excited ma'am
29/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are excited. After speaking with thousands of students and parents who completed their admission process before you, we realized that the current economic situation in African countries makes it a bit challenging for parents to pay the full registration fee at once. 

In response to the same challenge, we had a detailed discussion with the academic board and university official. As a result, we developed a solution to alleviate the financial burden of the parents specifically for the registration fee due of $500 to $1000.
29/1/24, 1:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We at Edoofa are thrilled about this development, and I believe it will significantly help all of our students and their families. Are you aware of the solution?
29/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 71 416 7312: No I wasn't ma'am
29/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the same. With respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee in two parts within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.
29/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: Consider that your registration fee is $1000. After you will receive the offer letter, the first part of the registration fees which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, i.e. $500 needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university (For most of the universities 15 days). Subsequently, the second part of $500, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/1/24, 1:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 29 , 2024, and your registration fee stands at $1000, you'll need to make a payment of $500 on or before January 29, 2024. The remaining $500 should be paid by February 29 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
29/1/24, 1:30 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes I have followed and no I don't have anything yet maam
29/1/24, 1:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, So are you excited to initiate the process? For the current round of admissions, only 31 scholarship seats are available and hence let us begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the payment plan offered for the registration fee. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
29/1/24, 1:31 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes I am ma'am
29/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
29/1/24, 1:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

29/1/24, 1:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome my dear, I wish you and your family a pleasant weekend ahead!

1/3/24, 12:30 PM - +263 77 289 4344: Hi ma'am is it possible we wait for another offer
1/3/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @263772894344 I will assist all your doubts at the end of your discussion please don't worry. At the moment, let's first discuss this offer letter right ?
1/3/24, 12:46 PM - +263 77 289 4344: Ok
1/3/24, 12:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
1/3/24, 12:48 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am it is
1/3/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
1/3/24, 12:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you? <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 12:57 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am
1/3/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
1/3/24, 1:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
1/3/24, 1:05 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Have read the message ma'am
1/3/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
1/3/24, 1:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
1/3/24, 1:15 PM - +263 71 416 7312: It is ma'am
1/3/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
1/3/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
1/3/24, 1:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
1/3/24, 1:21 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am
1/3/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
1/3/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees.
1/3/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $500 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
1/3/24, 1:25 PM - +263 71 416 7312: So we are to pay only $ 500 for my university fee
1/3/24, 1:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct, For the first year your tuition fees will be only $500. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
1/3/24, 1:30 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes
1/3/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as March 14th, 2024*.
1/3/24, 1:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion, I believe you recall that there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
1/3/24, 1:41 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am
1/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Given the payment plan, The $1000 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $500 before the first deadline date of *March 14th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $500 before the second deadline date of *April 14th , 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
1/3/24, 1:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $1000 within 15 working days, before March 14th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
1/3/24, 1:56 PM - +263 71 416 7312: It is clear
1/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
1/3/24, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence, there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
1/3/24, 2:01 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes we reside in Harare ma'am
1/3/24, 2:14 PM - +263 77 289 4344: Can I be excused I am going for an hour meeting
1/3/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263772894344
1/3/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
1/3/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
1/3/24, 2:27 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
1/3/24, 2:31 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Okay ma'am thank you
1/3/24, 2:43 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences. <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 2:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
1/3/24, 2:48 PM - +263 77 391 8729: How are you. You promised to attend to this request any feedback
1/3/24, 2:50 PM - +263 77 391 8729: As per your promise
1/3/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please don't worry, As I have shared that I will assist all your queries and doubts at the end of discussion. <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
1/3/24, 2:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
1/3/24, 3:08 PM - +263 71 416 7312: What is the ranking of MVN university

1/3/24, 3:26 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Thank you ma'am
1/3/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Before we conclude our conversation, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
1/3/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad. <This message was edited>
1/3/24, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday at 12;00 pm. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
1/3/24, 4:34 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am
1/3/24, 4:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: On that note, we will be bringing our today's conversation to a close. Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.
1/3/24, 4:38 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Before that ma'am I would like to ask since I have got a scholarship from this university does it mean the other universities won't have a chance to give me on too as well
1/3/24, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
1/3/24, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
1/3/24, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
1/3/24, 4:41 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am thank you
1/3/24, 4:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
1/3/24, 4:44 PM - +263 71 416 7312: No I didn't know that ma'am . So you saying if I pay the university fee and then I get offer letter from another university i can transfer to it
1/3/24, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
1/3/24, 4:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000, but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
1/3/24, 4:49 PM - +263 71 416 7312: Yes ma'am thank you
1/3/24, 4:49 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Is there any other doubt ?
1/3/24, 4:50 PM - +263 71 416 7312: No ma'am there isn't from my side
1/3/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear <This message was edited>
