I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. *I am Ms. Ashi, an Admission Officer at Edoofa*. Alongside *Ms. Vilsha, Head of Admissions at Edoofa*, I am thrilled to be a part of your university admission journey.

I am sure you must be aware that recently we have hosted the meet and greet sessions at the Martin Luther King Family of Schools, Harare last week. The entire Edoofa Team returned from Zimbabwe with a wealth of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for our students. I am excited to share some highlights from the event with you. <This message was edited>
