I was hoping for a response from your end regarding the discussion about the offer letter. However, I have not received a response yet. I understand that there might be challenges, but the discussion of the offer letter is crucial for you in terms of securing a seat in the university. Hence, if you are able to receive my message, please let me know so that we can proceed with the discussion of the offer letter.
18/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Good evening dear counsellors

19/12/23, 11:05 AM - +263 78 057 5394: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, if Mr. Shivjeet is available we can proceed

Network zone this side is not guaranteed
19/12/23, 7:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 8:15 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Yes I am
19/12/23, 9:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow at our scheduled time that is 2:00 PM. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 2:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Adelaide. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 2:37 PM - +263 78 057 5394: I am ready
20/12/23, 2:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
20/12/23, 2:45 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
20/12/23, 2:49 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Yes
20/12/23, 2:52 PM - +263 78 057 5394: I have a question though, you said my results are sent to various universities meaning there is a chance of other universities to send offer letters which i can choose from besides GGI
20/12/23, 2:53 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Your university scholarship application is based on merit systems. As of now, your application has been accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutions and since we have shared his application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from others.
20/12/23, 2:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once we get the same update, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application. So, you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application.
20/12/23, 2:55 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Ok then we can proceed
20/12/23, 3:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
20/12/23, 3:34 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
20/12/23, 3:40 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Tuition fee is $1 200 annual
Accomodation is also $1 200
Then the registration fee is $750 which will be reduced to $650 due to endowment plan
20/12/23, 3:44 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1200.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 3:47 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Ok, so the on campus hostel is what amounts to 1 200 per year
20/12/23, 6:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
20/12/23, 6:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
20/12/23, 8:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 2:00 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Adelaide. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session of your offer letter discussion?
25/12/23, 5:56 PM - +91 78278 47624 left
26/12/23, 2:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Adelaide. I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you by the time you were online as it was past my available hours and hence comes the Christmas holiday. In relation to this, I am now active to take on your session. Hence, May I know if you are currently available to proceed with our session for your Offer Letter Discussion?
26/12/23, 3:09 PM - +263 78 057 5394: We can continue sir

Greetings ladies and gentlemen
26/12/23, 3:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
26/12/23, 3:14 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Yes
26/12/23, 3:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
26/12/23, 3:17 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Please elaborate
26/12/23, 3:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
26/12/23, 3:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before December 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
26/12/23, 3:23 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Noted it's clear
26/12/23, 3:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
26/12/23, 3:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - +263 78 057 5394: I am in Bulawayo sir
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Please share with me the alternative modes
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
26/12/23, 3:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
26/12/23, 3:29 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
26/12/23, 3:30 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Ok noted thanks
26/12/23, 3:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
26/12/23, 3:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
26/12/23, 3:39 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Please share just in case I'm not sure which one of the methods my father will prefer using , he is not available on WhatsApp these days
26/12/23, 3:46 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Is it possible for me not to pay yet and wait for offer letters from other institutions??
26/12/23, 6:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
26/12/23, 6:07 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to add that in the event you want to wait for the next offer letter, you will be required to pay for the current offer letter in order to retain this offer if you want to back off from the next offer letter or the offer letter may come unsuccessful.

Regarding the registration fee that you are required to pay, it can be adjusted to the university of your choice, and you have the privilege to do that as you are an Edoofian. It is one of the benefits that we provide to our students in terms of affordability and choices. May I know if you are clear here?
26/12/23, 9:12 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Not really clear
27/12/23, 10:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Adelaide. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was not able to have a meaningful conversation today as I was occupied with the university official. Hence, I would like to continue our session tomorrow at 1:00 PM. Please let me know if this time is convenient for you. If not you can share your comfortable hours with me within the time frame from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM as well
28/12/23, 5:38 AM - +263 78 057 5394: 1pm is ok
28/12/23, 1:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Adelaide. 

How are you doing today?
28/12/23, 2:40 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Good afternoon

I am fine thanks how are you
28/12/23, 3:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great too, thank you for asking. I hope you are doing well today. As we are approaching the deadline. Shall we complete the discussion today?
28/12/23, 8:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end regarding the completion of the offer letter so that we do not end up missing the deadline. Hence, may I know if we are still connected so that we can proceed with the session? @263780575394 ?
16/1/24, 11:23 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Adelaide,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 11:24 AM - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
16/1/24, 1:09 PM - +263 78 057 5394: <Media omitted>
16/1/24, 7:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your results with us. I noticed that your A-level results didn't turn out as we had hoped, particularly with the challenge in one subject. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
16/1/24, 7:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
16/1/24, 7:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
16/1/24, 7:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly allow us time till Monday to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, Mr. Shubham, the senior career counselor at Edoofa will connect with you to guide you on the next steps in your academic career.
17/1/24, 7:57 AM - +263 78 057 5394: Thanks 👏
22/1/24, 12:53 PM - ~ Mr Gurvinder - Career Counselor added Shubham Edoofa Kam
22/1/24, 12:53 PM - +91 95403 01963: Good Day, Adelaide
*I am Mr Piiyush, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*
I hope you all are doing well

If you recall, I hosted your counselling and evaluation sessions, and you made me proud by qualifying for our prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. I received results from all my students, happy and exhilarating with joy. Recalling our interaction, I remembered that during our session you portrayed an enormous potential of becoming a leader of tomorrow. Hence I have asked my Colleague *Mr Shubham, Senior Academician* to personally look after your admission process so that we can proceed with your application on priority. 

Hence I request you to come online and continue with your admission procedures.
22/1/24, 3:05 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Good day  sir, i hope you are all well 
We can proceed
22/1/24, 7:31 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 09:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/1/24, 8:24 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone, 

*"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."*

*When you step into this day realize that you have immense opportunities! All you need to do is give your best to grab it.*

With all positive energy, I am here to continue our interactive session.
23/1/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 057 5394: Good morning sir 
Thank you for the motivational text

23/1/24, 9:47 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Glad to hear that please
23/1/24, 9:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 9:48 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Congratulations! For qualifying the Advanced Levels. The time has come when you and your family have to now make rational decisions as this is an impactful turning point in your career.
23/1/24, 9:51 AM - +263 78 057 5394: Thank you 😊
23/1/24, 10:22 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Do you know we at EDOOFA received 2000 Applications in a Single Day just a week before and each day since then we are receiving not less than 1000 Applications weekly from students seeking Scholarships?
23/1/24, 10:32 AM - +263 78 057 5394: I did not know you receive such big numbers but I knew Edoofa is a  big organization which is likely to get such many applications
23/1/24, 11:13 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: We were overwhelmed and had to reject more applications because of limited seats, however were surely intrigued to know the reasons for such an immediate upsurge.  Having Conversations with my other students who are already preparing to arrive in India under the Edoofa Scholarship shared some mind-boggling Screenshots from the Fee Prospectus of the Universities in Zimbabwe.

23/1/24, 11:17 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I am shocked to compile these data for Fee Structures of some famous Public Universities of Zimbabwe.

*Bindura University of Science Education (BUSE)* -https://www.buse.ac.zw/fees-structure/ - *($680 per term)*

NUST -*($870 per term)*
23/1/24, 11:17 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: *I am sure you and your family must have also discussed this,*. So what have you decided for your future ahead?
23/1/24, 11:28 AM - +263 78 057 5394: We have decided that i will continue my studies with Edoofa in India since my previous counsellor mentioned I'm eligible with 2 A level passes
23/1/24, 11:50 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Glad to hear that, Adelaide before I connected with you, I had a word with our Head Admissions Officer, Ms Vilsha and was quite taken aback by the news your application is still under process despite the passing of the months since we last interacted. Since, you being one of Mr Sagar's favourite students, I was intrigued to know the reasons behind the same and I wish to guide you in the very best way possible.
23/1/24, 11:52 AM - +263 78 057 5394: Noted with thanks
23/1/24, 2:02 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: That is absolutely understandable and thank you for sharing. Being a career counsellor, my aspirations for young learners like you are similar. I firmly believe higher education should combine the following for a learner to achieve their goals:-

Quality Education
Conducive Environment
Critical Thinking and Practical learning skills
Technological Literacy and Attachments
Cultural Awareness and Global Perspective
Career guidance, Mentorships, etc.


*However, not everyone achieves success. Do you know why*?
23/1/24, 2:11 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Why??
23/1/24, 2:12 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I see you are quite a visionary and we will work together to make the right decision for your career. It is important to know why the Edoofa guidance will be unique compared to the normal University approach.
23/1/24, 2:19 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 1) *Personalized mentorship and guidance throughout your course:* As your Career Counsellor, I have known you since the beginning of the process, understanding your interests, aspirations, family background and plans for your career, unlike a University officer who may come across your application for the first time and treats with the same importance like others. I personally understand where you come from and what is required for you to be successful. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:20 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:21 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: 3) *Financial Support and Planning:* With a flexible payment plan for registration fees spreading across 45 days, the remaining cost of education can be paid in two installments. Students are ensured to open Indian bank accounts so that parents can even deposit the fees in monthly installments. <This message was edited>
23/1/24, 2:24 PM - +263 78 057 5394: I like this about Edoofa it's not about you only but you engage the student so that we understand better for that thank you
23/1/24, 2:24 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:26 PM - +263 78 057 5394: That's nice .... noted
23/1/24, 2:26 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: <Media omitted>
23/1/24, 2:26 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: These are just a few of the various benefits and keeping all this in mind, are you ready to step into your higher education through the Edoofa Program which is the most popular scholarship in Africa?
23/1/24, 2:29 PM - +263 78 057 5394: I am ready yes
23/1/24, 2:30 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Perfect, To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor Of Business Administration and your intake is in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information is accurate?
23/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Yes it is very much correct
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As I have promised, the Edoofa Admissions team will be submitting your application to multiple universities that will evaluate your application and upon being eligible, you receive the offer letters with comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. *I will guide you to the best education institution/university associated with us that aligns with your vision and interest and would provide you with a conducive environment for your holistic development and to fulfil your career goals.*
23/1/24, 2:32 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Upon receiving the Offer Letter, you will have a few weeks to pay a portion of your university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. We discussed the registration fee during our counselling sessions. May I know, what do you recall about the same now?
23/1/24, 2:36 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Registration fee usually ranges from $500-$750 of which due to the Endowment plan Edoofa will pay for a $100 fee and I will finish up the rest ...... and this registration fee is part of my university fees meaning if I'm supposed to pay $2000  it will actually be $2000-$750 making the annual fee $1250
23/1/24, 2:39 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So, Adelaide, I have to bring to your notice that the Endowment plan that earlier waived off $100 from the fees will not be valid as of now, the reason being that earlier you were not able to grasp the opportunity and complete your admissions procedures on time
23/1/24, 2:40 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: As we discussed in the counselling session, the cost of education in India ranges from $6000-$8000 per annum which is reduced to $2000-$3000 per annum through the Edoofa Scholarship Program which includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, library fee etc. Now, let us assume,

1. *Tuition Fee*: $1800 per annum
2. *Food and Accommodation Fee*: $1000 per annum 
Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
3. *Registration Fee to be paid:* $1000
23/1/24, 2:40 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: This means this registration fee will be waived off from the cost of education ($2800-$1000= $1800) and the remaining fee of $1800 can be paid in two installments. The first part of $900 within 3 days after your arrival here in India and the remaining $900 will be due in December 2024, or before your second semester begins.

*Do you have any questions for me regarding the same?*
23/1/24, 2:42 PM - +263 78 057 5394: So the registration fee increased from $750?
23/1/24, 2:46 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please, That is Correct Adelaide
23/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Noted

23/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Isn't it this money is sent when we receive offer letters?
23/1/24, 2:50 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The registration fee can be paid either in two equal parts(The first half within 15 days and the second half within 30 days) or in one go itself.

Are you clear with the details?
23/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Yes I understand

My question is don't I pay this registration when I have received an offer letter???
23/1/24, 3:02 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Yes please, you would pay once you receive your acceptance letter Adelaide

23/1/24, 3:10 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
23/1/24, 3:17 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Nop i don't have any questions
23/1/24, 3:18 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: @263780575394 I understand that you are interested in this golden opportunity to study in India under the given Scholarship. I do realize that your Family Members may have other concerns and this is the reason I have requested our Program Director Mr. Abhinav to spare some time to talk to your Parents about this. I hope you recall that he was the one to Interview you and had a Video Call with your Parents?
23/1/24, 3:20 PM - +263 78 057 5394: Both of my parents are currently offline, my mother is offline due to network challenges in remote areas where she is and my father currently has no smartphone so he keeps up with the messages from my phone, you may be able to connect with him later on maybe 7p.m when he comes back from work
23/1/24, 3:29 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted, So Mr Zikhali will be available at 07:00 PM CAT?
23/1/24, 4:27 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Are we connected?
23/1/24, 7:23 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I was expecting your response, but it seems you were occupied at that moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
24/1/24, 8:04 AM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Good Morning Everyone,

24/1/24, 2:38 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: I understand please Mr Zikhali
24/1/24, 2:40 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Mr. Zikhali
I think you had a conversation with the Program Director Dr. Abhinav regarding your child’s admission process. He did inform us that your child is interested in a Business administration Course and considering the great opportunity a child has applying to jobs in Production Manager, Project Management, HR Manager and Marketing
Please this course however is one of the most demanded courses and we have a huge list of students waiting considering the challenge of Adelaide scoring not so well in the Zimsec, Dr. Abhinav has taken consultations and made special exceptions for her application.
24/1/24, 2:40 PM - +263 71 887 9714: I quite understand our communication.
24/1/24, 2:45 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Dr. Abhinav is personally looking at your child’s application and he also updated me that you had an issue with the university offered to Adelaide earlier, Which was the Gulzar group of Institutes, To which I can personally vouch, As my own students from the university are doing really well academically, So you need not worry about the same Andd we can guarantee that enrolling your daughter for the same university will be the right step for her bright education
24/1/24, 2:49 PM - +263 71 887 9714: Thank you I am pieased to hear from you as an academic.
24/1/24, 3:00 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Surely, So I was told by Dr Abhinav, That you would be completing your enrollment formalities by tomorrow since you are prepared with $650?
24/1/24, 3:02 PM - +263 71 887 9714: Yes quite true
24/1/24, 3:03 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted please, Shall I assist you with Payment methods?
24/1/24, 3:03 PM - +263 71 887 9714: Yes
24/1/24, 3:04 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
24/1/24, 3:04 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
24/1/24, 3:06 PM - +263 71 887 9714: No I reside in Bulawayo
24/1/24, 3:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Duly noted please!
24/1/24, 3:06 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
24/1/24, 3:07 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
24/1/24, 3:07 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
24/1/24, 3:08 PM - Shubham Edoofa Kam: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send.
