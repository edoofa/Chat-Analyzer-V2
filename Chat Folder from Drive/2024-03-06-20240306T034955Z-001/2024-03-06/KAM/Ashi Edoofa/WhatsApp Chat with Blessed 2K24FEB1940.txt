1/3/24, 1:46 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Ok.
My name is Blessed Mazambani. I am a 19 year old boy residing in Harare, Zimbabwe. I just finished my Advanced Level last year and excelled with 14 points in Pure Sciences. I was studying Pure Mathematics, Physics and Geography at A level. I dreaming of perusing Electrical Engineering at Tertiary Level as I always had this great passion towards Electricity and modern technology. Having wanted to be a an Electrical Engineer, I decided to enroll with Edoofa scholarship program to help this dream come true.

I am the first born in a family of 3. I was raised by both parents who work very hard for my education even when things were not quite well. My parents always try to help me with quality education hence encouraged me to enroll with Edoofa so as to make sure I get the best of education in India. My parents will be more than happy for me to be granted higher scholarship credits as they they cannot afford huge amounts of money due to economic instability here in Zimbabwe, however they can try and pay the reasonable amounts promised by Edoofa.
1/3/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your inspiring journey and aspirations. Your dedication to education and passion for electrical engineering are truly commendable. It's heartening to hear about the support from your hardworking parents and their commitment to providing you with the best education possible.

1/3/24, 1:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: We appreciate your efforts and will do our best to help make your dream of studying electrical engineering a reality. Wishing you continued success on your educational journey.
1/3/24, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
1/3/24, 2:02 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Ok, noted!
1/3/24, 2:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
2/3/24, 8:50 AM - +263 78 126 1024: Noted ma'am, we can start
2/3/24, 8:50 AM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/3/24, 8:53 AM - +263 78 126 1024: Yeah I have gone through the above ma'am, you can go ahead and explain
2/3/24, 8:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
2/3/24, 8:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
2/3/24, 8:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
2/3/24, 8:55 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
2/3/24, 9:14 AM - +263 78 126 1024: Very clear ma'am thank you, we can go ahead
2/3/24, 9:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
2/3/24, 9:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
2/3/24, 9:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
2/3/24, 9:19 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
2/3/24, 9:22 AM - +263 78 126 1024: Yes ma'am
2/3/24, 9:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
2/3/24, 9:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
2/3/24, 9:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
2/3/24, 9:25 AM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
2/3/24, 9:30 AM - +263 78 126 1024: All is clear thank you
2/3/24, 9:32 AM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
2/3/24, 9:33 AM - +263 78 126 1024: Of course yes
2/3/24, 9:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
2/3/24, 9:37 AM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

3/3/24, 7:45 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Ok in the first video I noted the two important aspects that the student must follow the instructions and also be very open minded.
In the second video where the co-founders of Edoofa explained their hard work in making the education affordable by giving scholarships and they also encouraged hard work from students.
The 3rd video was about the universities and colleges that the Edoofa may provide. These universities are quality universities that are in the top 50 of the universities in India.
Finally the last one was about the interaction with the universities in securing good scholarships and why one should be given a scholarship.
4/3/24, 12:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessed, I hope you had a good weekend!

4/3/24, 12:12 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Yes I'm available ma'am
4/3/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with me, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
4/3/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
4/3/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
4/3/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
4/3/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
4/3/24, 12:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
4/3/24, 12:19 PM - +263 78 126 1024: Yes I agree

4/3/24, 12:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.
