I hope you are doing well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. Thank you for sharing the receipt for the last part of your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.

16/1/24, 1:31 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Providence,

I trust this message finds you well, and I hope you are in high spirits. In recent days, our team has been actively engaging with students who aspire to join the university for the academic intake of August 2024. It has been truly heartening to witness the joy and enthusiasm expressed by some students upon receiving their A-Level results.

As I reflect on my school days, the memories of result days come rushing back - the blend of excitement and anticipation that surrounds such an important moment. It is a significant juncture that shapes the path course for one's academic journey.
16/1/24, 1:32 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: We understand that you, too, must be experiencing a similar mix of emotions as you would have checked your A-Level results by now and would be wondering about the steps you are supposed to undertake for your university admission and your higher education. 

For us to guide you through, could you please share your A-Level results so that we can add them to your scholarship application, discuss them with the academic board, and guide you the way further?
22/1/24, 7:32 AM - +263 77 481 4386: Good morning Officer. My daughter Providence Chikoto could not obtain good Advanced level results. She passed only mathematics with grade E. I would like to inquire if the University has an option of deferring the course to 2025 so that she can rewrite the two subjects she failed. Furthermore , may you advise us on minimum Advanced level requirement symbols for Cardiovascular technology. Again do they accept  two sittings  eg if she rewrite biology and chemistry to pass them with flying colours. <This message was edited>
22/1/24, 8:00 AM - +263 77 481 4386: She is also suggesting that she can opt for a Diploma course in cardiovascular technology if the University can accept her.
22/1/24, 8:20 AM - +263 77 509 3718: Or any deploma  in the medical field
23/1/24, 1:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Providence. Thank you for sharing your results with us. I understand that your A-level results didn't turn out as you had hoped. However, I want to take a moment to remind you that this result is not a reflection of your abilities or potential. It's simply a hurdle on your academic journey, one that you are more than capable of overcoming.
23/1/24, 1:15 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: It's important to remember that everyone faces setbacks at some point. What matters most is how we respond to them. This is an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflect on the experience, identify areas for improvement, and use this as a stepping stone towards future successes.
23/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Rest assured, that you have Edoofa’s full support in navigating this phase. Whether it's discussing options for retaking the exam, exploring alternative career paths, or just needing someone to guide you, we are here for you. 

I have taken note of your results and I will add them to your scholarship application. This will enable us to engage in discussions with the academic board and chart the best course of action for your next steps.
23/1/24, 1:16 PM - Sidhi Edoofa: Kindly allow us some time to thoroughly evaluate your results and plan the way forward. Once we have re-evaluated your application, along with all the other applications, we will reconnect with you to discuss the next steps in your academic journey.
23/1/24, 1:19 PM - +263 77 481 4386: Ok thank you Officer for reassurance. <This message was edited>
